## **Pakistan–Afghanistan Ceasefire: A Fragile Truce Amid Cross-Border Tensions**

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

#### **Context and Background**

* The **Pakistan–Afghanistan border**, demarcated by the **Durand Line (1893)**, has historically been a flashpoint marked by disputes, militant activity, and mutual mistrust.
* After the **Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan in August 2021**, Pakistan expected a cooperative regime. Instead, **cross-border militancy escalated**, primarily due to the **Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP)** — an armed group ideologically aligned with the Afghan Taliban but targeting Pakistan.
* The **TTP operates mainly from sanctuaries in eastern Afghanistan**, carrying out attacks in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan provinces.
* Pakistan’s **air strikes near Kabul** last week, targeting alleged TTP hideouts, triggered **retaliatory attacks**, escalating into a major border crisis.

#### **About the TTP**

* **Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP):** A coalition of Islamist militant groups formed in 2007 to enforce its version of Sharia in Pakistan.
* The TTP seeks to overthrow the Pakistani state, oppose the merger of tribal areas, and enforce a strict Islamic code.
* It is **distinct but aligned** with the **Afghan Taliban** — sharing ideology and tribal linkages.

---

  * Opens a new arena of instability along the **South-Central Asia corridor**, impacting regional connectivity and counter-terror efforts.
* **For India:**

  * Creates space for **India’s quiet diplomatic re-engagement** with Kabul as Pakistan’s credibility wanes.

##### **Ethical and Governance Concerns**

* Civilian casualties and refugee expulsions raise **humanitarian and moral issues**.
* The use of **air strikes across borders** without international sanction challenges sovereignty norms under international law.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Institutionalised Peace Mechanism:**

   * Establish a **Joint Border Peace Commission** under UN or SCO oversight for monitoring ceasefire violations and terrorist movements.

2. **Verifiable Counter-Terror Cooperation:**

   * Kabul must take **credible action** against the TTP; Pakistan should support **capacity building** rather than rely solely on military pressure.

## **Supreme Court’s Green Crackers Order: Balancing Tradition, Economy, and Environment**

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

#### **What are Firecrackers and Why Are They Controversial?**

* **Firecrackers** are explosive materials used during celebrations like Deepavali, symbolising victory of light over darkness.
* However, they emit **sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10)**, and heavy metals — all major air pollutants.
* Delhi, with its **geographical bowl-shaped topography**, **winter temperature inversion**, and **stubble burning**, faces severe air quality deterioration during festive months.
* The **Air Quality Index (AQI)** often rises to “Severe” (AQI > 400) after Diwali night, endangering respiratory health.

#### **What are Green Crackers?**

* **Green crackers** are **scientifically designed fireworks** that produce **30–40% less emissions** compared to traditional ones.
* Developed by the **Council of Scientific and Industrial Research – National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (CSIR-NEERI)**.
* They avoid banned chemicals such as **barium nitrate**, use safer oxidisers, and produce **reduced sound levels (<110 decibels)**.
* Categories include:

  * **SWAS** (Safe Water Releaser)
  * **STAR** (Safe Thermite Cracker)
  * **SAFAL** (Safe Minimal Aluminium)

---

## **Maoist Insurgency: Decline of India’s Longest Internal Security Challenge**

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

#### **Who are the Maoists?**

* The **Maoists**, or **Naxalites**, trace their ideology to **Marxism-Leninism-Maoism**, advocating **armed revolution** to overthrow the Indian state and establish a “people’s government.”
* The movement began in **1967** in **Naxalbari, West Bengal**, as a peasant uprising led by **Charu Majumdar** and **Kanu Sanyal**, hence the term *“Naxalite.”*
* The armed wing, **People’s Liberation Guerrilla Army (PLGA)**, operates under the **Communist Party of India (Maoist)**, formed in **2004** through the merger of two major left-wing groups.

#### **Core Ideology & Strategy**

* **“Protracted People’s War”** — following Mao Zedong’s strategy of encircling cities from rural bases.
* Build **“base areas”** in forested tribal regions, establish **parallel governance**, and **weaken state control** through targeted attacks.
* Use tribal discontent — over land alienation, displacement, and exploitation — as a mobilising force.

#### **Areas of Operation**

Historically, the Maoists had a strong presence in the **“Red Corridor”** spanning:

* **Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha, Maharashtra, Bihar, and West Bengal.**
  Today, they are confined to **11 districts**, with their core limited to **Bijapur, Narayanpur, and Sukma (Chhattisgarh).**

---

### 2. **The News**

#### **Current Situation**

* As of **2025**, the **Maoist insurgency is at its weakest point in decades.**

#### **Reasons for Decline**

1. **Effective Counter-Insurgency (CI) Operations:**

   * Security forces (CRPF, state police, and elite units like **CoBRA**, **Greyhounds**, **Jungle Warfare School, Kanker**) adapted to local terrain.
   * Use of **intelligence-led operations**, **better coordination**, and **community outreach**.

2. **Development & Governance Push:**

   * Governments since mid-2000s accelerated **road construction, education, healthcare, and communication** in tribal areas.
   * **Last-mile delivery of welfare schemes** increased the state’s legitimacy.

3. **Diminished Tribal Support:**

   * Tribals grew disillusioned as Maoists prioritised **violence over development**.
   * Maoist “justice systems” turned coercive, alienating local communities.

4. **Impact of Salwa Judum (2005–2011):**

   * Initially a state-backed vigilante movement that displaced many tribals, inadvertently feeding Maoist ranks.
   * However, after the **Supreme Court banned Salwa Judum (2011)** and the state professionalised counter-insurgency, recruitment dwindled.

5. **Surrenders & Ideological Fatigue:**

   * High-profile leaders, including **Politburo member Mallojula Venugopal Rao**, acknowledged the **failure of the Chinese/Russian revolutionary model** in India.
   * Growing realisation that **armed struggle** has no political or social future in a functioning democracy.
