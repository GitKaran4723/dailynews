# Great Nicobar revives the issue of nature’s legal rights
## The Great Nicobar Project and the Rights of Nature Debate

---

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

**Key Concepts:**

* **Great Nicobar Island:** The southernmost island of the Andaman & Nicobar archipelago; ecologically sensitive, home to tropical rainforests and tribal communities such as the Shompen and Nicobarese.
* **Biodiversity Hotspot:** A region rich in endemic species and under threat from human activities.
* **Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006:** Recognises the rights of forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes and other traditional forest dwellers to forest land and resources.
* **Earth Jurisprudence / Rights of Nature:** A legal philosophy recognising nature and ecosystems as entities possessing inherent rights, not merely as human property.
* **Legal Personhood:** The recognition of an entity (natural or artificial) as having rights and duties under the law.

**Background Context:**
The **Government of India’s Great Nicobar Project** includes plans to build a **transshipment port, airport, township, and power plant** on the island — a project valued in thousands of crores. However, it involves the **diversion of over 13,000 hectares of pristine rainforest**, threatening both biodiversity and the cultural survival of indigenous communities.

---

### 2. **The News**

The **Great Nicobar Mega Project** has raised serious ecological and legal concerns. Reports suggest that the **Andaman and Nicobar Administration falsely claimed** that the **forest rights of indigenous tribes had been settled** before clearing forest land for development — a potential violation of the **Forest Rights Act, 2006**.

Key Developments:

* The **Tribal Council of Little and Great Nicobar** contested the administration’s claim, asserting that **their consent was neither sought nor rights settled**.
* The **Supreme Court’s 2013 Niyamgiri Hills judgment** (Orissa Mining Corporation vs MoEF) established that **gram sabhas have the final authority** to decide on forest diversion impacting tribal and cultural rights.
* The **Great Nicobar case** echoes similar ecological conflicts witnessed in India — Tehri Dam, Koel Karo, and Sardar Sarovar — where large projects compromised fragile ecosystems.
* The debate has reignited interest in the global **“rights of nature” movement**, advocating legal recognition for ecosystems to safeguard against unrestrained exploitation.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

**Relevant Legal & Policy Frameworks:**

* **Forest Rights Act (2006):** Mandates recognition and settlement of tribal forest rights before diversion of forest land.
* **Forest Conservation Act (1980):** Regulates diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes.
* **Environment (Protection) Act (1986):** Provides the legislative framework for environmental clearance and impact assessment.
* **Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Rules, 2008:** Specifies that consent from gram sabhas is mandatory for diversion.
* **Supreme Court Precedents:**

  * **Niyamgiri Case (2013):** Empowered local tribal assemblies to protect cultural and ecological interests.
  * **Mohd. Salim vs State of Uttarakhand (2017):** Granted legal personhood to the Ganga and Yamuna rivers and associated ecosystems (though later stayed by the SC).
* **India’s Environmental Institutions:** National Green Tribunal (NGT), MoEFCC, and Island Development Authority oversee clearances and ecological monitoring.

**International Inspiration:**

* **Ecuador (2008):** Constitution recognised rights of nature.
* **Bolivia, Colombia, New Zealand:** Enacted laws granting natural entities legal standing (e.g., Atrato River, Whanganui River).

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

**GS Paper II & III Topics:**

* Governance: Role of Judiciary, Rights of Tribals, Environmental Legislation.
* Environment: Biodiversity Conservation, Sustainable Development.
* Ethics: Ecocentrism vs Anthropocentrism.

**Issues and Challenges:**

1. **Violation of FRA and Tribal Rights:** The alleged failure to obtain gram sabha consent undermines local governance and legal safeguards.
2. **Ecological Fragility:** The Great Nicobar Island is a **seismically active, biodiverse, and climate-sensitive zone**; large-scale construction could cause irreversible damage.
3. **Centralised Decision-Making:** Projects are planned from mainland India with little understanding of island ecology.
4. **Legal Enforcement Gap:** Environmental laws exist but are often bypassed through fast-tracked clearances.
5. **Ethical Dimension:** The conflict between economic development and intrinsic ecological rights — anthropocentric vs ecocentric worldviews.
6. **Accountability:** Absence of an institutional mechanism to represent the “voice of nature” in policy and legal proceedings.

**Impact Analysis:**

* **Ecological:** Loss of rainforest, biodiversity, and carbon sinks; increased vulnerability to tsunamis and cyclones.
* **Social:** Threat to indigenous lifestyles, displacement, and erosion of cultural heritage.
* **Economic:** Short-term development gains vs long-term sustainability losses.
* **Legal:** Sets a precedent for how India balances development with ecological justice.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Enforce the Forest Rights Act Strictly:**

   * Ensure **free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC)** of tribal gram sabhas before forest diversion.
   * Conduct **independent verification** of forest rights settlement claims.

2. **Adopt a Bio-Cultural Rights Framework:**

   * Recognise the **interdependence of ecosystems and indigenous communities**, similar to Colombia’s **Atrato River judgment (2016)**.

3. **Institutionalise Guardianship for Nature:**

   * Create a **“Nature Ombudsman” or Guardianship Council** to represent ecosystems’ legal rights in courts and policy decisions.

4. **Integrate ‘Rights of Nature’ into Indian Environmental Law:**

   * Amend laws like the **Environment (Protection) Act, 1986** to recognise **natural entities as legal stakeholders**.

5. **Ecologically Sensitive Development:**

   * Reassess the **Great Nicobar Master Plan** under the **Island Coastal Regulation Zone (ICRZ)** framework.
   * Prioritise **low-impact, community-led tourism and conservation-based economy**.

6. **Judicial Oversight and Accountability:**

   * The Supreme Court should review the **legality of forest diversion and FRA compliance** in Great Nicobar, applying the Niyamgiri precedent.

7. **Global Learning:**

   * Study legal innovations from **New Zealand, Ecuador, and Colombia** to frame an Indian model of environmental personhood aligned with constitutional environmental duties (Article 48A & Article 51A(g)).

# Do cash transfers build women’s agency?
## Gendered Politics of Welfare and Women’s Economic Empowerment in India

---

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

**Key Concepts:**

* **Gendered Welfare Politics:** The increasing trend of designing welfare schemes specifically targeting women as beneficiaries — both for empowerment and electoral gains.
* **Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT):** A mechanism that allows the transfer of subsidies or welfare payments directly into beneficiaries’ bank accounts, reducing leakages and ensuring transparency.
* **JAM Trinity:** Refers to the integration of **Jan Dhan accounts**, **Aadhaar identification**, and **Mobile connectivity** — the backbone of India’s financial inclusion ecosystem.
* **Financial Inclusion vs Financial Agency:** Financial inclusion ensures access to financial services, while financial agency means the ability to make independent financial decisions and use those services meaningfully.

**Background:**
India’s welfare state has evolved from providing subsidies in kind to direct cash transfers. Recent years have witnessed a **“feminisation of welfare”**, where women are positioned as direct recipients of benefits to enhance efficiency and political appeal.
This shift coincides with **digital financial inclusion**, made possible through the JAM architecture, which has given millions of Indian women their first formal financial identity.

---

### 2. **The News**

Ahead of the 2025 Assembly elections, the **Bihar government launched the *Mukhyamantri Mahila Rojgar Yojana*** — a ₹10,000 direct cash transfer to 75 lakh women as **seed capital for self-employment**. Women who successfully establish or expand businesses can receive **up to ₹2 lakh in additional assistance**.

**Comparable Initiatives Across States:**

* **Karnataka:** *Gruha Lakshmi Yojana* — ₹2,000 monthly assistance to women heads of households.
* **West Bengal:** *Lakshmir Bhandar* — ₹500–₹1,000 monthly income support for women.
* **Madhya Pradesh:** *Ladli Behna Yojana* — ₹1,000 monthly transfer with social welfare benefits.
* **Telangana:** *Mahalakshmi Scheme* — direct cash support and subsidised gas and transport for women.

**Enabling Infrastructure:**

* Over **56 crore Jan Dhan accounts** opened; **55.7% owned by women**.
* **89% of Indian women** now have a bank account — surpassing global averages.
* However, **20% of women’s accounts remain dormant**; usage for savings or credit is minimal.
* Women lag behind men in **digital financial usage** due to **mobile phone gaps, digital illiteracy, and patriarchal control**.

Thus, while DBT-driven welfare programmes have expanded access, **the transition from financial access to financial agency remains incomplete**.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

**National Initiatives Supporting Women’s Financial Inclusion:**

1. **Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY, 2014):** Universal financial access through zero-balance accounts; women constitute the majority of account holders.
2. **Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (PMMY, 2015):** Credit for women-led small businesses; *Shishu* category loans are often availed by women.
3. **Stand-Up India Scheme (2016):** Encourages women and SC/ST entrepreneurs to start enterprises through bank loans.
4. **Mahila E-Haat (2016):** Digital marketing platform for women entrepreneurs.
5. **National Rural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM):** Promotes self-help groups (SHGs) and micro-entrepreneurship among rural women.
6. **Digital Saksharta Abhiyan (DISHA):** Promotes digital literacy, especially among rural women.
7. **JAM Trinity and DBT Mission:** Enable targeted and transparent transfers through Aadhaar-linked bank accounts and mobile verification.

**International Context:**

* India’s model of DBT + digital infrastructure has been cited globally (World Bank, IMF) as a model for efficient welfare delivery.
* However, international experiences show that **financial inclusion alone doesn’t ensure empowerment** — capacity-building and property rights are equally critical.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

**GS Paper II & III Topics:**

* Welfare Schemes for Vulnerable Sections
* Issues Relating to Poverty and Development
* Women Empowerment and Social Justice
* Inclusive Growth and Financial Inclusion

**Issues and Challenges:**

1. **Dormant Accounts:** Nearly 1 in 5 women’s bank accounts remain inactive due to lack of funds or confidence in using formal banking.
2. **Digital Divide:** Women are 19% less likely to own mobile phones; shared devices undermine privacy and autonomy.
3. **Patriarchal Barriers:** Male control over finances persists; two-thirds of women rely on male relatives for banking transactions.
4. **Lack of Financial Literacy:** Many women cannot operate ATMs, mobile banking apps, or UPI systems independently.
5. **Tokenistic Empowerment:** Cash transfers may be politically expedient but fail to build sustainable livelihoods.
6. **Limited Access to Assets and Credit:** Without collateral or property rights, women cannot leverage formal credit to grow enterprises.

**Impacts:**

* **Positive:**

  * Enhanced visibility of women as financial actors.
  * Improved intra-household decision-making power.
  * Greater transparency in welfare delivery.
* **Negative:**

  * Risk of creating dependency rather than empowerment.
  * Uneven benefits due to digital exclusion.
  * Political instrumentalisation of welfare benefits.

**Ethical & Governance Dimensions:**

* *Ethics of Welfare:* Welfare should promote autonomy, not dependence.
* *Governance Challenge:* Ensuring that welfare translates into sustainable empowerment, not merely electoral gains.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Move from Access to Agency:**

   * Introduce *financial and digital literacy modules* for all DBT beneficiaries.
   * Ensure women not only receive funds but also learn to manage and invest them effectively.

2. **Strengthen Property and Asset Rights:**

   * Promote **joint land titles and property ownership** for women.
   * Link entrepreneurship incentives to asset creation, not just cash inflows.

3. **Enhance Digital Empowerment:**

   * Provide **subsidised smartphones and data plans** to poor women.
   * Develop **vernacular fintech apps** with voice assistance for low-literacy users.

4. **Increase Female Banking Agents:**

   * Recruit and train **more women as business correspondents (BCs)** — currently less than 10%.
   * Female agents improve comfort, trust, and participation in financial transactions.

5. **Design Gender-Sensitive Financial Products:**

   * Encourage banks and fintech firms to create savings, microcredit, and insurance products suited to women’s **irregular income patterns**.

6. **Build Community Networks:**

   * Expand initiatives like **Digital Banking Sakhis**, SHG-led financial circles, and secure WhatsApp/UPI groups for peer support and knowledge-sharing.

7. **Integrate Welfare with Skill Development:**

   * Link schemes like *Mukhyamantri Mahila Rojgar Yojana* with **Skill India** and **Mudra** for sustained self-employment.

8. **Institutionalise Gender Audits:**

   * Regularly assess welfare schemes’ impacts on **women’s agency, autonomy, and long-term income generation**.

---

**Conclusion:**
India’s welfare system has evolved from **“cash in hand” to “identity in hand”** — with women at its centre. However, real empowerment demands going beyond financial access to **financial capability, digital autonomy, and asset control**.
For women to become true economic agents — not just beneficiaries — welfare must be designed as a bridge to empowerment, not an end in itself.
