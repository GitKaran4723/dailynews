# Have ‘green’ crackers brought down pollution?
## Supreme Court Allows Sale of “Green” Crackers Before Deepavali

---

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

**Background:**
Firecrackers have long been part of India’s festive traditions, especially **Deepavali (Diwali)**. However, growing concern over **air pollution** and its health impacts has led to repeated restrictions on their use, particularly in **Delhi-NCR**, one of the most polluted regions in the world.

In 2018, the **Supreme Court** banned conventional firecrackers and permitted only “green crackers” — a cleaner, less polluting alternative developed by the **Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)** and **National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI)**.

**What are Green Crackers?**
“Green” crackers are **re-engineered fireworks** designed to reduce harmful emissions — particularly **particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5)**, **sulphur dioxide (SO₂)**, and **nitrous oxides (NOx)**.
They are not zero-emission, but rather **“reduced-emission fireworks” (REFs)** — a term preferred by scientists.

**Key Ingredients and Chemistry:**
Traditional crackers use toxic chemicals like **barium nitrate**, **antimony**, and other heavy metals, all linked to respiratory illnesses and cancer.
Green crackers achieve reduced emissions through:

* **Zeolite additives** – absorb pollutants and act as oxidisers.
* **Boron-based reagents** – release water vapour that suppresses dust.
* **Metallic composites** – improve combustion efficiency and brightness while reducing smoke.

---

### 2. **The News**

In the **run-up to Deepavali 2025**, the **Supreme Court of India** legalized the **sale of green crackers** nationwide, attempting to balance:

* **Cultural sentiments** during the festival,
* **Environmental concerns** due to pollution, and
* **Livelihood issues** of workers in the firecracker industry, especially from **Sivakasi, Tamil Nadu** — India’s fireworks hub.

**Key Points from the Order:**

* Only **green crackers** certified by **NEERI** and **licensed by PESO** can be sold.
* Sale and bursting of traditional crackers remain banned.
* Crackers can only be used within prescribed hours to minimize air quality impact.

**Performance & Data:**

* **Complaints of poor air quality** persist: AQI levels in Delhi-NCR remained “very poor” before and during the festival.
* Despite introduction of green crackers, **no major improvement in air quality** has been observed since 2018.
* Over **1,500 manufacturers**, mostly from **Tamil Nadu** and **West Bengal**, registered with NEERI to produce these crackers in 2025.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

#### a) **Scientific Development**

* **CSIR-NEERI Initiative (2018):** Developed 3 main types of green crackers –

  * **SWAS (Safe Water Releaser)** – releases water vapour to suppress dust.
  * **STAR (Safe Thermite Cracker)** – minimal noise and smoke.

# What is Google’s ‘quantum advantage’ leap?
## Google’s Willow Quantum Processor Demonstrates Verifiable Quantum Advantage

---

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

#### **What is Quantum Computing?**

Quantum computing is a **revolutionary form of computation** that uses the principles of **quantum mechanics** — particularly *superposition*, *entanglement*, and *interference* — to process information.

* A **classical computer** uses bits that can be either **0 or 1**.
* A **quantum computer** uses **quantum bits (qubits)** that can exist in **superpositions** of 0 and 1 simultaneously.

This allows quantum computers to process **vast combinations of possibilities at once**, providing exponential speedups for certain problems compared to classical computers.

**Key Quantum Phenomena:**

* **Superposition:** A qubit can represent multiple states (0 and 1) simultaneously.
* **Entanglement:** Qubits can become correlated such that the state of one instantly affects the other, regardless of distance.
* **Interference:** The wave-like nature of qubits allows desirable outcomes to be amplified and undesirable ones to be cancelled out — like constructive and destructive interference in waves.

By precisely controlling these interferences, quantum computers can “steer” probabilities toward correct answers.

---

### 2. **The News**

In **two papers published in *Nature* on October 22, 2025**, researchers from **Google, MIT, Stanford, and Caltech** announced a **verifiable display of quantum advantage** using Google’s **Willow quantum processor**.

#### **Key Announcements:**

1. **Paper 1 – Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI):**

   * Introduced a **quantum algorithm for optimization problems** (finding the best solution among many).
   * DQI leverages **quantum interference** to amplify good solutions and suppress bad ones.
   * Achieved faster and more accurate results on a problem called the **optimal polynomial intersection problem** — outperforming all known classical methods.

2. **Paper 2 – Quantum Scrambling Experiment:**

   * Explored how **information spreads (or “scrambles”)** across quantum systems — akin to how a drop of dye diffuses in water.
   * Used an advanced **interference and reversal** technique (measuring OTOC — Out-of-Time-Order Correlator) to quantify how information becomes hidden and intertwined within the system.
   * Demonstrated that **Willow** could simulate this complex quantum process much faster than the world’s best supercomputers.

**Benchmark Result:**

* The **Willow processor** solved a problem that would take the **world’s second-fastest supercomputer over three years** — in just **two hours**.
* This marks a **clear experimental case of quantum advantage** (also called *quantum supremacy*), where a quantum computer outperforms any known classical computer.
