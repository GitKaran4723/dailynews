# The danger of an unchecked pre-crime framework
---

## Preventive Detention and the Constitutional Dilemma in India

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Preventive Detention** refers to the imprisonment of a person **to prevent them from committing a possible future offence**, rather than as punishment for an actual offence committed.
* It is a **pre-emptive legal mechanism** allowing the State to detain individuals without trial, if it believes their actions could endanger **public order, national security, or essential supplies and services**.
* Under **Article 22(3)–(7)** of the **Indian Constitution**, preventive detention laws are constitutionally permissible, making India one of the few democratic nations that provides explicit constitutional sanction for such detention.
* The **maximum period of preventive detention** is **3 months**, unless extended by an **Advisory Board** (Article 22(4)). Parliament can, however, modify this period for specific classes of persons or situations.
* **Key Laws:**

  * National Security Act (NSA), 1980
  * Prevention of Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1988
  * State-specific laws such as **Kerala Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act (KAAPA), 2007**

**Golden Triangle:** Refers to **Articles 14, 19, and 21** — the triad protecting equality, freedom, and life and liberty. Preventive detention sits in contrast to these, forming what scholars call a *“constitutional Bermuda Triangle”*, where fundamental rights seem to disappear.

---

### 2. **The News**

* In **June 2025**, the **Supreme Court of India**, in *Dhanya M. vs State of Kerala (2025 INSC 809)*, **set aside a preventive detention order** issued under the **Kerala Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act, 2007 (KAAPA)**.
* The Court reiterated that:

  * Preventive detention must be exercised **sparingly and strictly within constitutional safeguards**.
  * There is a **vital distinction between “law and order” and “public order”**; the latter justifies preventive detention, not the former.
  * Preventive detention **cannot substitute criminal prosecution or bypass bail orders**.
* The Court’s stance aligns with earlier rulings such as:

  * *S.K. Nazneen vs State of Telangana (2023)* – preventive detention not justified for law and order issues.
  * *Rekha vs State of Tamil Nadu (2011)* – preventive detention is an **exception to Article 21**, used only in **rare cases**.
  * *Banka Sneha Sheela vs State of Telangana (2021)* – preventive detention actions must pass the **Article 21 test** of fairness and reasonableness.
* Despite these judicial cautions, **broad definitions** in preventive detention laws (like “goonda” or “rowdy”) allow **executive overreach**, making such detentions a routine administrative tool rather than an extraordinary measure.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Legal Framework**

* **Constitutional Provisions:**

  * *Article 22(3)–(7):* Allows preventive detention and outlines procedural safeguards.
  * *Parliamentary powers:* Can extend detention beyond 3 months or legislate on specific preventive detention contexts.
* **Major Legislations:**

  * **Preventive Detention Act, 1950** (expired in 1969) — first post-Independence law.
  * **Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA), 1971** — widely misused during the Emergency (1975–77).
  * **National Security Act (NSA), 1980** — current central preventive detention law.
  * **State Acts:** e.g., KAAPA (Kerala), Goondas Act (Tamil Nadu), and Telangana PD Act.
* **Judicial Safeguards:**

  * Communication of detention grounds to the detainee (Article 22(5)).
  * Right to representation before an Advisory Board of judges.
  * Periodic judicial review through writ jurisdiction (Articles 32 and 226).

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### **Issues and Challenges**

* **Erosion of Fundamental Rights:** Preventive detention stands at odds with **Articles 14, 19, and 21**, undermining equality, liberty, and due process.
* **Subjective Satisfaction:** Detaining authority’s “subjective satisfaction” often escapes effective judicial scrutiny.
* **Executive Overreach:** Used to detain dissenters, protesters, or minor offenders under the guise of maintaining public order.
* **Judicial Inconsistency:** Post-*Maneka Gandhi*, due process principles were expanded, yet preventive detention remains insulated from them (*A.K. Roy vs Union of India*, 1982).
* **Colonial Legacy:** Originates from the **Bengal Regulation III of 1818** and retained post-Independence.

#### **Impacts**

* **Political:** Weakens democratic accountability; enables misuse by ruling authorities.
* **Social:** Creates fear and distrust among marginalized or dissenting groups.
* **Legal:** Dilutes constitutionalism and weakens the principle of “innocent until proven guilty.”
* **Administrative:** Encourages police dependency on detention powers instead of improving investigation and prosecution, as noted by **Granville Austin**.

#### **Ethical and Governance Concerns**

* Violates **natural justice** principles — *audi alteram partem* (right to be heard).
* Challenges **rule of law** and **presumption of innocence**.
* Raises concerns about **human dignity and misuse of state power**.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Restrict Scope of Preventive Detention:** Limit it strictly to extraordinary cases like **terrorism, espionage, and organized transnational crime**.
2. **Judicial Oversight Mechanisms:** Mandatory **judicial authorization** for detention beyond 15 days and regular review by independent boards.
3. **Doctrine of Proportionality:** Apply proportionality test under **Articles 14, 19, and 21**, as used in other fundamental rights jurisprudence.
4. **Legislative Reform:** Narrow definitions in State laws (e.g., “goonda”, “rowdy”) to prevent arbitrary detention.
5. **Transparency and Accountability:** Annual publication of preventive detention statistics and review reports by the **Ministry of Home Affairs**.
6. **Strengthen Due Process:** Ensure timely communication of detention grounds and access to legal representation.
7. **Capacity Building:** Train police and prosecutors to rely on **evidence-based prosecution** rather than preemptive detention.
8. **Public Awareness & Debate:** Foster legal literacy and constitutional awareness on the rights implications of preventive detention.

## Supreme Court’s Ruling on Post-Facto Environmental Clearances: Implications for India’s Environmental Governance

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Environmental Clearance (EC):** A mandatory approval process under the **Environment (Protection) Act, 1986**, requiring industries and infrastructure projects to assess their **environmental impact** before starting construction or operation.
* **Post-facto EC (Retrospective Clearance):** A controversial practice where a project that began **without prior EC** could later seek **retrospective approval**, often with penalties or environmental remediation measures.
* **Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification, 2006:** The main legal framework governing ECs. It requires prior clearance for projects likely to have a significant environmental impact.
* **Supreme Court Ruling (May 16, 2025):** Declared **post-facto environmental clearances illegal**, upholding the principle that **no project can be legalised retrospectively** if it began without prior environmental approval.
* **Legal Context:** Builds on precedents from **S.P. Muthuraman v. Union of India (2013)** (NGT ruling) and **Vanashakti v. Union of India (2025)**, reinforcing the constitutional principle of **sustainable development under Article 21**.

---

### 2. **The News**

* **What happened:** The **Supreme Court of India**, in a landmark judgment on **May 16, 2025**, ruled that **post-facto (retrospective) environmental clearances** are **invalid and unconstitutional**.
* **Impact:**

  * Projects that began construction or operation **without prior EC** cannot later be “regularised.”
  * The verdict effectively bans retrospective approvals granted by the **Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC)** and **State Environment Impact Assessment Authorities (SEIAAs)**.
* **Wider Implications:**

  * Created widespread confusion among **States, industries, and urban local bodies** regarding what to do with already existing buildings, industries, and public infrastructure lacking EC.
  * Several States have reportedly begun **demolition actions** against non-compliant structures.
* **Judicial Follow-up:** Following petitions from **CREDAI (Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India)** and others, the Supreme Court has **agreed to review** its verdict to consider its socio-economic implications.

---

* **National Clean Air Programme (NCAP)** and **National River Conservation Plan (NRCP):** Reflect India’s broader environmental governance framework.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### **Issues and Challenges**

* **Regulatory Ambiguity:** 12-year gap between the NGT’s 2013 order and the 2025 judgment created a **legal grey zone**, during which many projects proceeded assuming retrospective clearance was permissible.
* **Economic Fallout:**

  * Possible **closure or demolition** of thousands of ongoing projects.
  * **Investment uncertainty** in infrastructure, housing, and manufacturing.
* **Environmental Paradox:**

  * **Mass demolitions** could themselves cause pollution, debris, and emissions, defeating environmental goals.
* **Governance Vacuum:**

  * Lack of **clear transition guidelines** or differentiation between major and minor violations.
  * States interpreting the judgment inconsistently.
* **Implementation Risks:** May push violators **underground**, making compliance and monitoring more difficult.

#### **Constitutional and Legal Analysis:**

* The judgment reaffirms the **precautionary principle** and the **polluter pays principle**.
* However, it arguably neglects the **principle of proportionality** and **sustainable development**, which require balancing **environmental protection with social and economic welfare**.
* **Article 21 (Right to Life)**, as interpreted by the Court itself in *Vellore Citizens’ Welfare Forum (1996)* and *Narmada Bachao Andolan (2000)*, demands a **harmonious balance** between development and environment.

#### **Impacts:**

* **Economic:** Could slow infrastructure and real estate sectors; reduce investor confidence.
* **Environmental:** Strengthens rule-based environmental governance but may cause unintended ecological harm if demolitions are unplanned.
* **Social:** Displacement risks for communities living in affected structures.
* **Administrative:** Exposes weaknesses in India’s **clearance and monitoring mechanisms**.

* **Key Concept:**

  * Accidents are **not inevitable** — they result from **management failures** and **regulatory negligence**.
  * According to the **International Labour Organization (ILO)**, 2.3 million people die globally each year due to work-related accidents or diseases — and **India accounts for one in four workplace fatalities**, making it one of the world’s deadliest countries for workers.

### 2. **The News**

* **Recent Accidents (2025):**

  1. **Sigachi Industries Chemical Blast (Telangana, June 30):**

     * Reactor explosion killed **40 workers** and injured many more.
     * The reactor was operating at **double the permissible temperature**; alarms and safety systems failed.
  2. **Gokulesh Fireworks Explosion (Sivakasi, July 1):**

     * **Eight workers** died; lack of safety protocols and storage mismanagement were major causes.
  3. **Ennore Thermal Power Station Collapse (Chennai, September 30):**

     * **Nine workers** died when a **coal-handling plant collapsed**, likely due to faulty design and weak scaffolding.
* **Pattern:**

  * Absence of trained safety officers, outdated machinery, poor maintenance, and use of **unregistered, informal workers** without safety gear or documentation.
* **Global Context:**

  * **British Safety Council**: India accounts for **25% of global workplace deaths** — a likely underestimate due to widespread **underreporting** in the informal sector.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Legal Framework**

#### **Historical Laws:**

1. **Factories Act, 1948:**

   * Cornerstone of industrial safety; covers factory licensing, machinery maintenance, working hours, sanitation, and welfare facilities.
   * Amended in **1976** and **1987** (after the **Bhopal Gas Tragedy**) to strengthen safety and hazardous process controls.
2. **Workmen’s Compensation Act, 1923 (Now: Employees’ Compensation Act, 2017):**

   * Provides monetary compensation for injury, disability, or death due to work-related causes.
3. **Employees’ State Insurance Act, 1948:**

   * Offers social security, medical care, and compensation for workplace accidents.

#### **Post-Liberalisation Reforms:**

* Since the **1990s**, India has **relaxed labour inspections**, encouraging **self-certification** and reducing mandatory compliance in the name of *Ease of Doing Business*.
* **Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions (OSHWC) Code, 2020:**

  * Consolidates 13 central labour laws, including the Factories Act.
  * Moves workplace safety from being a **statutory right** to an **executive discretion**.
  * Reduces inspection frequency, allowing **randomised or web-based inspections** instead of mandatory ones.
  * Not yet implemented (currently in abeyance).
* **Maharashtra (2015)** and **Karnataka (2023)** extended working hours, reduced rest periods — worsening fatigue-related accidents.

#### **International Framework:**

* **ILO Conventions 155 & 187:** Concern occupational safety, health, and working environments (India has not ratified them yet).
* **UN SDG 8 (Decent Work & Economic Growth):** Calls for safe and secure working environments for all workers.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### **Issues and Challenges:**

* **Weak Enforcement:** Shrinking inspectorates and “self-certification” make violations invisible.
* **Informalisation of Labour:** Over **90% of India’s workforce** is informal, lacking safety gear, contracts, or insurance.
* **Employer Negligence:** Safety seen as an expense, not an investment.
* **Lack of Accountability:** Employers rarely face criminal prosecution; compensation often comes from **public ex gratia funds**, not company liability.
* **Outdated Technology:** Many factories operate with unsafe machinery and no emergency response system.
* **Cultural Apathy:** Worker safety rarely prioritized in policy discourse or corporate governance.

#### **Impacts:**

* **Human:** Massive loss of life, long-term disabilities, and psychological trauma for families.
* **Economic:** Productivity loss, compensation burdens, and reduced foreign investment due to unsafe conditions.
* **Social:** Reinforces inequality — contract and informal workers face highest risks without social security.
* **Ethical:** Violates **Article 21 (Right to Life)** and **Article 42 (Provision for humane working conditions)** of the Constitution.

#### **Case Studies:**

* **Bhopal Gas Tragedy (1984):** Triggered global debate on industrial safety; led to 1987 amendment of the Factories Act.
* **Vizag Gas Leak (2020):** Showed recurring negligence in hazardous industries.
* **Sigachi & Ennore (2025):** Modern-day reflections of the same systemic failure.

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Reinstate Labour Inspections:**

   * Make safety inspections **mandatory, frequent, and independent**, with transparency via public dashboards.

2. **Criminal Accountability:**

   * Amend OSH Code to include **strict criminal liability** for negligent employers in fatal accidents.
   * Ensure penalties are **proportionate to company turnover** to deter large corporations.

3. **Worker Empowerment:**

   * Strengthen **trade unions** and **workplace safety committees** with legal authority to halt unsafe operations.
   * Make safety training mandatory before employment.

4. **Digital Monitoring:**

   * Create a **National Occupational Safety Portal** integrating factory registration, accident data, and compliance audits.

5. **Focus on Informal Sector:**

   * Extend safety and insurance under **e-SHRAM** and **ESIC** to contract and gig workers.

6. **Corporate Governance:**

   * Mandate **ESG (Environment, Social, Governance)** disclosure of workplace safety records in annual reports.

7. **Public Awareness and Education:**

   * Incorporate **occupational safety education** in vocational training and skilling programmes.

8. **International Alignment:**

   * Ratify **ILO Conventions 155 & 187** and align domestic policy with **UN SDG 8.8** (safe working environments).

### ⚖️ **Conclusion**

India’s recurring industrial disasters — from **Bhopal (1984)** to **Telangana (2025)** — expose a deep moral and institutional failure: **workers’ lives remain expendable in the pursuit of profit**. Safety cannot be treated as a regulatory formality or a privilege granted by employers.

Restoring **workplace safety as a fundamental right**, backed by strong inspections, criminal accountability, and social protection, is essential to achieve **just and humane work conditions** envisioned under the Constitution.
Without such reform, every factory floor remains a potential crime scene, and every worker a casualty waiting to happen.
