# Cyclone Montha makes landfall;rain batters several parts of A.P.
## Cyclone *Montha* Landfall in Andhra Pradesh

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Cyclones** are intense low-pressure systems over warm ocean waters that lead to strong winds and heavy rainfall.
* In India, tropical cyclones are classified by the **India Meteorological Department (IMD)** as:

  * Depression → Deep Depression → Cyclonic Storm → Severe Cyclonic Storm → Very Severe Cyclonic Storm → Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm → Super Cyclone, based on wind speed.
* **Landfall** refers to the event when a cyclone’s eye moves across the coastline, bringing maximum wind and rain.

# Rethinking immigration in the age of exclusion
## Reassessing Columbus and the Colonial Legacy in the Modern Immigration Debate

---

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Christopher Columbus (1492):**
  An Italian explorer sailing under the Spanish crown, Columbus’s 1492 voyage to the Americas marked the onset of **European colonization**. It led to large-scale displacement, enslavement, and extermination of Indigenous peoples across the continents.

* **Settler Colonialism:**
  A form of colonization where foreign settlers permanently occupy land, **displacing and replacing native populations**, as seen in the Americas, Australia, and South Africa.

* **Immigration and American Identity:**
  The U.S. is often described as a **“nation of immigrants”**, but this overlooks its foundations in **indigenous genocide, African enslavement, and exclusionary immigration policies**.

* **Historical Amnesia:**
  The selective remembrance or distortion of history to maintain dominant narratives — in this case, glorifying Columbus and erasing colonial violence — helps sustain structures of **racial inequality and nationalism**.

* **Trump-era Immigration Politics:**
  Characterized by **anti-immigrant rhetoric**, restrictive policies (e.g., **Muslim ban, border wall, family separations**), and the framing of immigration as a **security and cultural threat** rather than a humanitarian issue.

---

### 2. **The News (Context of the Essay)**

The essay critically examines how the **myth of Columbus** continues to shape **modern U.S. immigration discourse**.

* The author highlights the **irony of American exceptionalism** — a nation built on colonization and forced migration now vilifies modern migrants seeking safety and opportunity.
* It draws parallels between **historical conquest** (Columbus’s invasion of the Americas) and **contemporary exclusionary nationalism** (Trump-era immigration policies).
* The piece critiques the **distortion of historical memory**, showing how the glorification of Columbus erases Indigenous suffering and justifies ongoing **imperial and racial hierarchies**.
* References such as the use of “**Geronimo**” (Apache leader) as a U.S. military code word expose how colonial narratives still influence modern militarism and identity politics.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

#### **In the U.S. Context:**

* **Immigration Reforms and Debates:**

  * Policies under **Trump administration (2017–2021)**: Muslim travel ban, family separations, “zero-tolerance” border enforcement, and the push for a U.S.–Mexico border wall.
  * **Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA):** Obama-era protection for undocumented youth, later contested.
  * **Biden administration’s reforms:** Efforts to restore asylum pathways and repeal restrictive policies, though challenges remain.

* **Commemoration Reforms:**

  * Increasing replacement of **Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples’ Day** in many U.S. states, recognizing Indigenous suffering and resistance.
  * Public school curricula are slowly incorporating **decolonial historical perspectives** and Indigenous histories.

#### **Global Human Rights Frameworks:**

* **UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (2007)** — affirms Indigenous sovereignty and protection from forced displacement.
* **Global Compact for Migration (2018):** Recognizes migration as a human right and seeks safe, orderly, and humane movement of people.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### **Issues & Challenges:**

* **Historical Revisionism vs. Nationalism:** Questioning Columbus’s legacy is often branded as “anti-national,” showing how **history is politicized**.
* **Racial Hierarchies and Structural Inequality:** Colonial legacies continue to marginalize Indigenous peoples and migrants, especially from the Global South.
* **Selective Humanitarianism:** The West champions human rights but often denies asylum to victims of wars or crises it indirectly fuels.
* **Migration as a Political Weapon:** Anti-immigrant narratives are used to mobilize populism and deflect economic or political failures.
* **Moral Hypocrisy:** Nations founded on migration now criminalize the same act for others, exposing **deep moral contradictions**.

#### **Societal and Ethical Dimensions:**

* The **erasure of Indigenous suffering** perpetuates social injustice.
* The **dehumanization of migrants** undermines global solidarity and compassion.
* The essay raises ethical questions about **historical accountability**, **memory**, and the **right to mobility** as a human aspiration.

#### **Global Implications:**

* The Columbus narrative and U.S. immigration politics are emblematic of broader **North–South divides** and **racialized geopolitics** in migration governance.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Reclaim Historical Truth:**

   * Decolonize education by including Indigenous and marginalized voices.
   * Reframe Columbus’s “discovery” as **invasion and genocide** — not as a heroic act.

2. **Promote Humanitarian Migration Policies:**

   * Recognize migration as a **right, not a crime**.
   * Strengthen global cooperation for safe and legal migration pathways.

3. **Institutional Accountability:**

   * Reform immigration systems to align with **international human rights standards**.
   * Create mechanisms to address **historical injustices** against Indigenous peoples and displaced communities.

4. **Cultural and Symbolic Reforms:**

   * Replace colonial commemorations (e.g., Columbus Day) with **Indigenous Peoples’ Day** globally.
   * Encourage **public memorials** and art that highlight suppressed histories.

5. **Ethical Leadership in Global North:**

   * Wealthy nations must acknowledge their role in creating the **conditions for forced migration** through wars, sanctions, and environmental degradation.
   * Promote a **justice-based international order** that respects dignity and mobility.

---

### 🧭 **Summary Insight**

The essay urges a **moral and historical reckoning** with colonialism’s enduring legacies. By glorifying Columbus, humanity conceals genocide under the mask of “civilization.” By demonizing modern migrants, it repeats the same exclusionary logic that began in 1492. True justice demands both remembrance and reform — a reimagined world that honors Indigenous sovereignty and recognizes **migration as a universal human aspiration rooted in survival and hope**.
