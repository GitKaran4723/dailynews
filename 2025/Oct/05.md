# What is Nagaland’s job quota issue?
---

## **Nagaland Job Reservation Policy Controversy**

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

**Key Concepts:**

* **Scheduled Tribes (STs):** Communities recognized under Article 342 of the Indian Constitution as socially and economically disadvantaged, eligible for affirmative action.
* **Backward Tribes (BTs):** In Nagaland, a sub-category of tribes identified as relatively less developed among STs, receiving additional job reservation benefits under the “reservation within reservation” policy.
* **Reservation Policy:** A mechanism under Article 16(4) of the Constitution that allows the State to make special provisions for the advancement of backward classes in public employment.

**Background:**

* Nagaland became a State in **December 1963**.
* In **1967**, the State introduced an **80% reservation** in government jobs for all indigenous Naga tribes.
* In **1977**, the government further identified **11 Backward Tribes (BTs)** and created a system of **“reservation within reservation.”**
* Presently, **37%** of non-technical and non-gazetted jobs are reserved for these BTs:

  * **25%** for seven BTs in **Eastern Nagaland** (six districts)
  * **12%** for four other BTs (mainly from Phek, Kiphire, and Peren districts)

### 2. **The News**

On **April 26, 2024**, a coalition of **five “advanced” tribes** in Nagaland — the **Angami, Ao, Lotha, Rengma, and Sumi (outside Kiphire)** — set a **30-day deadline** for Chief Minister **Neiphiu Rio’s government** to revise the **job reservation policy** for Backward Tribes (BTs).

The government eventually formed a **panel on September 22, 2024**, to review the policy, but the **Five Tribes Committee on Review of Reservation Policy (CoRRP)** rejected it, citing issues with the **panel’s composition and nomenclature.**

**Key timeline:**

* **April 26:** CoRRP issues a 30-day ultimatum to revise policy.
* **June 17:** Government promises to form a commission after initial protests.
* **August 6:** Cabinet approves a **Job Reservation Commission**.
* **September 22:** A second panel is formed, but CoRRP rejects it, alleging bias.
* **Present:** The standoff continues due to disagreement over the review panel’s neutrality and seriousness.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **1977:** State identifies 11 Backward Tribes and introduces internal job quota.
* **2011 Notification:** Clarifies distribution of reservation percentages among BTs (e.g., Zeliang – 4%, Sumi (Kiphire) – 2%).
* **2024 (August):** Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio reiterates that any major revision will be considered only after the **2027 Census**.
* **2024 (August–September):** Government sets up commissions (first and second) to examine the policy after pressure from CoRRP.
* **Personnel & Administrative Reforms Department:** The nodal body responsible for quota implementation.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

**a. Issues and Challenges**

* **Equity vs. Equality:** The demand for revision raises questions about balancing affirmative action with changing socio-economic realities.
* **Socio-political fault lines:** The issue has exposed divisions between **“advanced” and “backward” tribes**, risking inter-tribal tension.
* **Administrative challenges:** Multiple commissions and resistance indicate **governance bottlenecks** and **policy inertia**.
* **Data deficit:** Lack of up-to-date socio-economic and educational surveys makes evidence-based policy difficult.

**b. Impacts**

* **Social:** May deepen ethnic divisions and weaken Naga unity.
* **Political:** Could affect representation, local elections, and policymaking.
* **Economic:** Job distribution imbalances may affect regional development in Eastern vs. Western Nagaland.
* **Governance:** The controversy tests the government’s ability to mediate between competing tribal interests while maintaining fairness and stability.

**c. Ethical & Governance Concerns**

* Questions of **procedural fairness**, **transparency in policymaking**, and **representation in commissions**.
* Ethical dilemma between **justice for historically marginalized groups** and **fairness for advanced groups now disadvantaged by policy inertia**.

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Comprehensive Socio-Economic Survey:**
   Conduct an **independent, data-driven assessment** of all tribes’ education, income, and employment levels before revising the policy.

2. **Neutral Commission:**
   Reconstitute a **truly independent review body**, possibly including **retired judges or academicians**, with equitable representation from both BTs and non-BTs.

3. **Periodic Review Mechanism:**
   Institutionalize a **10-year review cycle** for all affirmative action policies to ensure responsiveness to changing conditions.

4. **Inter-Tribal Dialogue:**
   Promote a **statewide consultative platform** under the aegis of the **Nagaland Tribal Affairs Department** to foster consensus and avoid ethnic polarization.

5. **Focus on Capacity Building:**
   Instead of reducing BT quotas abruptly, enhance **education, skill development, and entrepreneurship** initiatives for all tribes to minimize dependency on government jobs.

6. **Legal and Constitutional Compliance:**
   Ensure that any policy change aligns with **Articles 14, 15(4), and 16(4)** of the Constitution, maintaining both **equity and justice**.

# How is India responding to crowding disasters?
---

## **Karur Crowd Crush Tragedy, Tamil Nadu (September 2024)**

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

**Key Concepts:**

* **Crowd Crush / Stampede:** A disaster that occurs when too many people are packed into a confined area, leading to suffocation or trampling injuries due to uncontrolled crowd movement.
* **Mass Gathering Management:** A field of disaster risk reduction (DRR) focusing on planning, coordination, and regulation of large public events (political rallies, religious congregations, concerts, etc.).
* **Scientific Crowd Control:** Using data, simulation, and monitoring technologies (like drones, AI-based sensors, and CCTV) to predict and manage crowd density and flow safely.

**Background Context:**

* India frequently hosts mass gatherings for religious, political, and cultural reasons — from **Kumbh Melas** to **election rallies** — making crowd management a critical public safety issue.
* Despite NDMA and BPR&D guidelines, implementation remains **advisory**, not **statutory**, leaving enforcement gaps at the State and local levels.

---

### 2. **The News**

On **September 27, 2024**, a **political rally in Karur district, Tamil Nadu**, by actor-turned-politician **Vijay**, founder of the **Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK)**, ended in a **fatal crowd crush**, killing **41 people** — mostly **young adults aged 18–30** — and injuring dozens.

**Sequence of Events:**

* The rally was part of Vijay’s **statewide political outreach**.
* Police rejected congested central locations and approved **Velusamypuram** on the Karur–Erode road.
* People began gathering from **9 a.m.**, expecting Vijay at **12 p.m.**, but he arrived **around 6 p.m.**
* The **crowd surged** as his convoy struggled to reach the site.
* **Congestion, poor access control, and lack of exit routes** led to panic and collapse of crowd stability.
* Around **7:20 p.m.**, people began fainting, triggering a **chain reaction of suffocation and collapse**.
* Emergency services arrived late; **41 deaths** were confirmed by nightfall.

**Government Action:**

* Chief Minister **M.K. Stalin** ordered an inquiry by a **one-person commission** headed by **Justice (retd.) Aruna Jagadeesan**.
* He promised **rules for public events** after the commission’s report submission.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### **a. Issues and Challenges**

* **Absence of statutory framework:** Most guidelines (NDMA, BPR&D) are advisory, lacking legal enforceability.
* **Event mismanagement:** Poor coordination between police, organisers, and local administration.
* **Unscientific venue selection:** Failure to assess **crowd capacity**, **entry–exit routes**, and **flow direction**.
* **Delayed response:** Lack of **real-time monitoring** and **trained emergency personnel**.
* **Reactive governance:** States act **only after disasters**, not proactively.

#### **b. Broader Impacts**

* **Social:** Loss of life erodes public trust; leads to grief and unrest.
* **Political:** Questions raised on **accountability** of event organisers and State administration.
* **Economic:** Compensation payouts, medical care costs, and disruption of local economies.
* **Governance:** Demonstrates need for **disaster preparedness** at micro-administrative levels.

#### **c. Ethical and Governance Concerns**

* **Negligence vs Accountability:** Balancing blame between organisers, police, and government.
* **Public Safety as a Right:** Crowds are often treated as political capital, not as human lives needing safety guarantees.

# Why is a spectre of empty classrooms looming?
---

## **Supreme Court’s TET Mandate and Tamil Nadu’s Review Petition**

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

**Key Concepts:**

* **TET (Teacher Eligibility Test):**
  A qualifying exam mandated by the **National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE)** under the **Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009**, to ensure minimum standards of teaching quality for Classes I–VIII.
  It tests pedagogical and subject knowledge and is a **prerequisite for recruitment or promotion** in schools under Section 23 of the RTE Act.

* **Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009:**
  Enacted to give effect to **Article 21A** of the Constitution — the **fundamental right to free and compulsory education** for children aged **6 to 14 years**.
  Section 2(n) of the Act defines “schools” to include **government, aided, unaided, and private institutions**.

* **Article 142 (Supreme Court’s Power):**
  Empowers the Court to pass any order necessary for **complete justice** in a case — used here to partly exempt certain teachers from the TET mandate.

* **Minority Educational Institutions:**
  Institutions established and administered by minorities under **Article 30(1)**. Their exemption from RTE Act provisions was upheld in the **Pramati Educational and Cultural Trust case (2014)**.

---

### 2. **The News**

On **September 1, 2024**, the **Supreme Court of India** ruled that **all in-service teachers** from **Classes I–VIII in non-minority schools** must clear the **Teachers’ Eligibility Test (TET)** within **two years**, or face **compulsory retirement** with terminal benefits.

The judgment was delivered by a **Bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and Manmohan** in a batch of appeals concerning teacher qualification norms under the RTE Act.

#### **Key Provisions of the Judgment:**

* Teachers with **less than 5 years left to retire** are **exempted** from taking TET but **cannot be promoted** without it.
* Teachers with **more than 5 years of service** must **clear TET within two years**, failing which they **must retire compulsorily**.
* **Future appointments and promotions** in all non-minority schools **mandatorily require TET qualification**.
* The judgment also **referred to a larger Bench** the question of **including minority institutions** within the RTE Act’s scope.

#### **Tamil Nadu’s Context:**

* Tamil Nadu employs **4,49,850 teachers** in government and aided schools.
* Of these, **3,90,458 (about 87%)** are **not TET-qualified**.
* Implementation of the judgment would **disqualify most teachers**, potentially causing **a collapse of the school system** and affecting **millions of children’s education**.

The Tamil Nadu government, supported by other States, has filed a **review petition** in the Supreme Court seeking reconsideration of the order.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Legal Framework**

#### **Relevant Provisions of the RTE Act (2009):**

* **Section 23(1):**
  NCTE prescribes **minimum qualifications** for appointment of teachers, including passing the **TET**.

* **Section 23(2):**
  The **Central Government** may **relax these qualifications** for up to **five years** in special circumstances, such as teacher shortages.

* **Proviso to Section 23:**
  Teachers already in service at the **commencement of the RTE Act (2010)** were given **five years** to acquire the minimum qualifications.

#### **NCTE Notification (August 23, 2010):**

* Mandated **TET qualification** for all new teacher appointments post-RTE.
* Intended to **standardize teacher quality** across States.

#### **Judicial Context:**

* **Pramati Educational and Cultural Trust (2014):**
  Exempted **minority schools** from the RTE Act — now under reconsideration due to possible misuse of “minority” status.

* **September 1, 2024 Judgment:**
  Argued that excluding minority institutions **undermines inclusivity** and **universal education**, contrary to **Article 21A**.

#### **State Government’s Stance (Tamil Nadu & Others):**

* **Support quality education**, but oppose **retroactive disqualification** of validly appointed teachers.
* Recommend **alternatives** like **in-service training**, **refresher courses**, and **capacity-building** instead of punitive measures.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### **a. Issues and Challenges**

* **Policy vs Practicality:**
  Ensuring quality education (through TET) vs. preserving continuity and stability in schools.

* **Constitutional Conflict:**
  Between **Article 21A (right to education)** and **judicial enforcement of quality standards** through TET.
  Mass teacher disqualification may **jeopardize access** to education.

* **Retrospective Application:**
  Applying TET norms to teachers appointed **before** the RTE Act violates **principles of natural justice**.

* **Administrative Burden:**
  Conducting TET for lakhs of in-service teachers within two years poses **massive logistical challenges**.

* **Equity & Teacher Morale:**
  Long-serving teachers face job insecurity despite years of experience and service, affecting morale and classroom outcomes.

#### **b. Broader Impacts**

* **Educational Disruption:**
  Shortage of qualified teachers could paralyze schooling, particularly in **rural and underprivileged areas**.

* **Legal Implications:**
  Raises the issue of **judicial overreach** in administrative matters and federal tensions between **Centre and States**.

* **Quality vs Quantity Dilemma:**
  Balancing national standards (quality) with regional realities (teacher availability).

#### **c. Ethical and Governance Concerns**

* **Fairness:** Retroactive enforcement penalizes teachers who entered service under valid laws.
* **Governance Ethics:** Governments must ensure that reforms enhance learning outcomes, not punish the workforce.
* **Children’s Welfare:** A strict implementation could deny millions their right to continuous education.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Phased Implementation of TET:**

   * Extend the **compliance period** beyond two years.
   * Allow **staggered exams** and **multiple attempts** with bridging support.

2. **In-Service Professional Development:**

   * Introduce **mandatory refresher courses**, **pedagogical workshops**, and **capacity-building** modules instead of blanket disqualification.

3. **Recognition of Prior Experience:**

   * Develop a **competency-based equivalence system** where experienced teachers can be certified through **performance assessments**.

4. **Strengthen State Autonomy:**

   * Permit **States to frame contextual teacher quality frameworks**, subject to minimum national standards.

5. **Special Relaxation Mechanism (Section 23(2)):**

   * The **Central Government** can issue a notification **temporarily relaxing** TET requirements in States facing shortages.

6. **Comprehensive Review by Larger Bench:**

   * Supreme Court’s **larger Bench** should reconsider inclusion of **minority schools under RTE** to prevent policy loopholes.

7. **Integrated National Teacher Reform:**

   * Reform recruitment, training, and evaluation holistically, linking **TET**, **in-service performance**, and **continuous professional development (CPD)**.
