# Number of births declines; deaths rise slightly: report
## Civil Registration System (CRS) Report 2023 — Trends in Births, Deaths, and Sex Ratio in India

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Civil Registration System (CRS):**

  * A **nationwide continuous, permanent, and compulsory recording** of births, deaths, and other vital events under the **Registration of Births and Deaths Act, 1969**.
  * Data is compiled annually by the **Office of the Registrar-General of India (RGI)** under the **Ministry of Home Affairs**.
* **Purpose:**

  * To provide official data for **population estimates**, **health indicators**, and **policy planning**.
  * CRS data serves as the **basis for fertility, mortality, and demographic analysis**, supplementing surveys like NFHS and Census.
* **Key Definitions:**

  * **Sex Ratio at Birth (SRB):** Number of female births per 1,000 male births — a crucial indicator of gender equality.
  * **Institutional Births:** Deliveries conducted in government or private health facilities — an indicator of maternal and neonatal healthcare access.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### **Issues and Challenges:**

1. **Demographic Transition:**

   * Gradual decline in birth rate reflects India’s move towards **population stabilisation**, but raises future concerns over **ageing population** and **labour force contraction**.
2. **Gender Imbalance:**

   * Persistently low SRB in states like **Bihar, Jharkhand, Haryana, Gujarat** suggests ongoing **sex-selective practices** despite legal bans (e.g., PCPNDT Act).
3. **Data Disparities:**

   * Incomplete or delayed registrations in some states reduce reliability for policy planning.
4. **Health Infrastructure Gaps:**

   * 25% of births still occur outside institutions, posing risks for **maternal and infant mortality**.
5. **COVID-19 Data Divergence:**

   * The mismatch between CRS and Health Ministry’s COVID dashboard indicates **data transparency and attribution challenges**.

#### **Impacts:**

* **Social:** Low sex ratio perpetuates gender-based discrimination and social instability.
* **Economic:** Declining fertility may affect workforce and productivity in coming decades.
* **Policy:** Highlights the need for **unified vital statistics systems** for health, population, and planning.
* **Governance:** Reflects uneven administrative performance across states in record maintenance and service delivery.
