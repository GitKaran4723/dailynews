# Inflation lessons
## Retail Inflation Falls to 99-Month Low (September 2025)

---

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

**Key Concepts:**

* **Retail Inflation (CPI):** Measures the rise in prices of goods and services consumed by households. It’s expressed as a percentage and reflects changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI).
* **RBI’s Inflation Target:** The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) operates under a flexible inflation targeting framework, with a **target of 4% (+/- 2%)**, meaning inflation between **2% and 6%** is considered acceptable.
* **Monetary Policy Committee (MPC):** A six-member body that sets the repo rate (the rate at which the RBI lends to commercial banks) to control inflation and support growth.
* **Real Wages:** Wages adjusted for inflation. An increase in real wages means purchasing power is improving, boosting consumption.

**Background:**
India’s inflation has historically been on the higher side, often close to or above 6%. A fall to 1.54%—the lowest in nearly **99 months**—signals subdued demand and possible economic slack.

---

### 2. **The News**

* **What happened:** Retail inflation (CPI-based) dropped to **1.54% in September 2025**, marking the **lowest level in over 8 years (99 months)**.
* **Trend:** Except for August, inflation has been slowing **throughout FY 2025–26**, averaging **2.2%** in the first half of the fiscal year.
* **RBI’s position:** Earlier, when inflation was high, RBI aimed firmly for 4%. Now, despite low inflation, the central bank hasn’t adjusted its stance to stimulate demand.
* **Implications:** Persistently low inflation indicates that **supply is outpacing demand**, hinting at weak consumption. Sectors like **clothing and footwear (2.3%)** have seen declining prices for two years.
* **Broader context:** Unlike China, India cannot easily depend on exports to absorb excess supply, especially amid **global tariff tensions**.
* **Policy response so far:** The government has used **income-tax rebates** and **GST rate cuts** to spur demand, but these measures had limited and short-lived effects.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

**(a) Conceptual Significance:**

* Explains the **transition from pre-Industrial stagnation** to **modern sustained growth**, showing that technological progress—not just capital accumulation—is key.
* Bridges **economic history**, **growth theory**, and **innovation policy**.

**(b) Issues and Challenges:**

* Balancing innovation with equity: Creative destruction can widen inequalities if displaced workers or sectors are not supported.
* Over-centralisation of innovation: When a few firms dominate R&D (e.g., tech giants), social benefits may lag behind private gains.
* Need for global cooperation on intellectual property and technology transfer, especially for developing economies.

**(c) Economic Impacts:**

* Encourages **knowledge-based economies**, investment in **STEM**, and **institutional support** for risk-taking.
* Aligns growth theory with real-world policies on **innovation clusters**, **startups**, and **green technologies**.

**(d) Ethical and Governance Aspects:**

* Importance of inclusive growth: technological disruption must be managed ethically.
* Ensuring that innovation benefits society broadly, not just monopolistic incumbents.

**In Essence:**
The 2025 Nobel laureates unified history, theory, and policy to explain that **sustained economic growth is not merely about capital or resources—but about societies that continuously generate, apply, and adapt knowledge**.
Their work underscores a timeless principle: **innovation thrives where ideas meet skilled hands and open minds.**
