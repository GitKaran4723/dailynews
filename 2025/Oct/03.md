## Electoral Roll Revision in Bihar — Concerns Over ECI’s Special Intensive Revision (SIR)

---

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

**Key Concepts:**

* **Electoral Roll:** The official list of persons entitled to vote in elections in India. Prepared and updated by the **Election Commission of India (ECI)** under the **Representation of the People Act, 1950**.
* **Special Intensive Revision (SIR):** A process undertaken by the ECI to thoroughly clean and update electoral rolls — typically to remove deceased, migrated, or duplicate entries and to add new eligible voters.
* **Form 6:** Used to apply for inclusion of names in the electoral roll.
* **Inclusion and Deletion Criteria:**

  * *Inclusion* — individuals turning 18, missing voters.
  * *Deletion* — due to death, migration, duplication, or non-verification.

A clean and accurate voter list ensures **free and fair elections**, but overzealous deletion or lack of transparency can lead to **mass disenfranchisement**, especially among **marginalized groups** (women, poor, SCs/OBCs).

---

### 2. **The News**

* The **ECI completed a Special Intensive Revision (SIR)** of the electoral rolls in **Bihar**, reducing the number of voters from **7.89 crore to 7.42 crore** — a deletion of **65 lakh names**.
* The stated reasons were **death, migration, duplication, and lack of enumeration**.
* However, the **Supreme Court of India intervened**, directing the ECI to provide reasons for each deletion and greater transparency.
* **Concerns arose** over:

  * Disproportionate deletion of **women’s names**.
  * Lack of **public notice** or access to deletion data.
  * Rejection of **widely held identity documents** (e.g., Aadhaar, ration card) in favor of less accessible ones (e.g., birth or domicile certificates).
  * Absence of a **public appeals mechanism**.
* Despite the controversy, the ECI aims to **extend the SIR nationwide**, prompting fears of **large-scale exclusion** if the same opaque methods are used.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Constitutional Backing:**

  * **Article 324** — Empowers the ECI to supervise, direct, and control elections.
  * **Representation of the People Act (1950 & 1951)** — Lays down procedures for preparing and revising electoral rolls.
* **Past Measures:**

  * Introduction of **Booth Level Officers (BLOs)** for door-to-door verification.
  * Use of **Aadhaar linkage (EPIC-Aadhaar seeding)** for authentication and de-duplication (though voluntary after Supreme Court privacy rulings).
  * **Systematic Voters’ Education and Electoral Participation (SVEEP)** program to promote inclusion.
* **Judicial Oversight:**

  * The **Supreme Court** has consistently upheld the need for **transparency and inclusivity** in voter registration and roll revision (e.g., *PUCL vs Union of India*, 2003).

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

# Will China capture the electrolyser market?
## **China’s Growing Dominance in the Global Green Hydrogen Market**

---

### **1. Basic Understanding**

**What is Green Hydrogen?**

* **Hydrogen** is used extensively in industries such as **oil refining, ammonia production (fertilizers), methanol, and steelmaking**.
* It is classified based on the energy source used for production:

  * **Grey Hydrogen:** Produced from natural gas; emits CO₂.
  * **Blue Hydrogen:** Produced from fossil fuels but with carbon capture and storage (CCS).
  * **Green Hydrogen:** Produced by **electrolysis of water using renewable energy**, emitting zero carbon.

**Electrolysers** — devices that split water (H₂O) into hydrogen and oxygen using electricity — are **central to green hydrogen production**, much like **solar PV modules** are for solar energy.

**Types of Electrolysers:**

1. **Alkaline (ALK)** – mature technology, cheaper but less efficient with fluctuating renewable power.
2. **Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM)** – newer, costlier, but more efficient and provides higher purity hydrogen.

**Relevance:**
Green hydrogen is crucial for **deep decarbonisation** of industries that cannot easily switch to renewable electricity — like steel, shipping, aviation, and fertilizers.

---

### **2. The News**

* **China has become the world’s leading hydrogen producer**, generating **36.5 million tonnes annually**, including **1,20,000 tonnes of green hydrogen** (≈50% of global output).
* **Electrolyser Dominance:** China controls **85% of the global ALK electrolyser manufacturing capacity**, becoming the world’s largest producer and exporter.
* **Pricing Advantage:**

  * **ALK electrolyser (5 MW)** costs about **¥6 million (~$167/kW)** — **20% cheaper** than in 2023.
  * **PEM electrolyser (1 MW)** also costs ¥6 million (~$838/kW), **32% cheaper** than in 2023.
  * This makes hydrogen production in Europe up to **45% cheaper** using Chinese equipment.
* **Raw Materials:** China’s advantage stems from **abundant nickel and steel**, which are key inputs for ALK electrolysers.

  * However, **PEM electrolysers** need **iridium, platinum, titanium** — critical minerals that China largely **imports**.
* **Global Expansion:**

  * Chinese firms such as **LONGi**, **Envision**, and **Guofu Hydrogen** are investing in **overseas hydrogen plants**.
  * **Envision Energy** launched the **world’s largest green hydrogen and ammonia plant**, fully powered by renewables.
