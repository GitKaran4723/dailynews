# At IMO, 57 nations vote for delaying framework for carbon-free shipping
## IMO Vote on Global Shipping Decarbonisation Framework

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **International Maritime Organization (IMO):** A specialized UN agency responsible for regulating international shipping, including maritime safety and environmental performance.
* **Shipping and Climate Impact:** The shipping industry contributes around **3% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions** — comparable to Germany’s total emissions.
* **IMO GHG Strategy (2023):** Aims for the global shipping sector to reach **net-zero emissions by 2050**, with an interim goal of reducing carbon intensity (CO₂ per tonne-km) by **40% by 2030** and 70% by 2040.
* **Carbon Pricing Mechanism:** A proposed global tax or levy on carbon emissions from ships, intended to incentivize cleaner fuels and fund climate action in developing countries.
* **Fuel Standard:** Would establish rules for the use of low-carbon or zero-emission fuels (like green hydrogen or ammonia) starting from **2027**.

---

### 2. **The News**

* **What happened:** The **IMO postponed a key vote** on adopting a new framework for decarbonising global shipping — including a carbon pricing mechanism and new fuel standards.
* **When & Where:** The vote was to be held in **London** in **October 2025**, following preparatory work since April.
* **Who was involved:**

  * The **United States** pressured countries to **delay** or reject the proposal, calling it a “Global Green New Scam Tax.”
  * **Saudi Arabia** and **Russia** opposed the plan outright.
  * **Singapore** proposed a **1-year delay**, which 57 countries supported.
  * **49 voted against**, and **21 abstained**.
  * Earlier, **63 countries**, including **India, China, Brazil, Japan, and the EU**, had supported the decarbonisation framework in principle.
* **Result:** The decision on implementing the carbon pricing and fuel standards was **postponed by one year**, seen as a setback for climate progress.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Global Level:**

  * **IMO GHG Strategy (2023)** — international commitment to net-zero shipping by 2050.
  * **Paris Agreement (2015):** Though shipping is not directly covered, its decarbonisation aligns with Article 4 commitments to reduce global GHGs.
* **India’s Role:**

  * India supports **decarbonising maritime transport**, but advocates for **“common but differentiated responsibilities” (CBDR)** — meaning developing nations should not bear equal financial burdens.
  * India’s **Maritime India Vision 2030** promotes **green ports**, **shore power**, and **LNG fuel adoption**.
  * The **Harit Sagar Guidelines (2023)** encourage ports to achieve **carbon neutrality** through renewable energy and waste reduction.
* **Other Nations:**

  * The **EU** has implemented the **Emissions Trading System (ETS)** for ships calling at European ports.
  * The **U.S.**, under President Trump, opposes global carbon taxation, citing domestic economic interests.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### **a) Issues & Challenges**

* **Geopolitical resistance:** The U.S. and oil-exporting countries oppose carbon taxes, fearing trade disruptions.
* **Economic impact:** Carbon pricing could raise **shipping costs** and **commodity prices**, affecting global trade.
* **Equity concerns:** Developing countries argue they will face **disproportionate economic burdens** without sufficient financial or technological support.
* **Institutional credibility:** IMO’s delay undermines the **UN’s climate credibility** and weakens multilateral consensus.

#### **b) Impacts**

* **Environmental:** Delay in global decarbonisation efforts; continued high maritime GHG emissions.
* **Economic:** Potential distortion of global shipping markets; competitive disadvantages for nations adopting early green measures.
* **Political:** Growing divide between developed and developing nations over climate finance and responsibility.
* **Ethical:** Raises questions about **climate justice** and responsibility toward vulnerable island nations like **Vanuatu**, which face existential threats from climate change.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Rebuild Consensus at IMO:**

   * Encourage **inclusive diplomacy** between developed and developing nations to agree on phased carbon pricing and transition funds.
2. **Establish a Global Climate Fund for Maritime Transition:**

   * Channel carbon levy proceeds to assist developing nations in **technology adoption and port decarbonisation**.
3. **Promote Green Maritime Corridors:**

   * Bilateral or regional “green shipping lanes” between major ports can showcase feasibility before global rollout.
4. **Strengthen Technological Cooperation:**

   * Encourage R&D in **alternative fuels (ammonia, hydrogen, methanol)** and retrofitting of old vessels.
5. **Ensure Equity and Just Transition:**

   * Implement **differentiated targets** respecting nations’ capacities, aligning with CBDR principles.
6. **India’s Strategy:**

   * Continue supporting IMO’s net-zero goal but advocate for **financial support**, **technology transfer**, and **realistic timelines** for developing economies.

# What are the new PF withdrawal guidelines?
## EPFO’s New Partial Withdrawal Rules

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **EPFO (Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation):**
  A statutory body under the **Ministry of Labour and Employment**, managing the **Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF)**, **Employees’ Pension Scheme (EPS)**, and **Employees’ Deposit Linked Insurance (EDLI)**. It ensures retirement savings for organized-sector employees in India.

* **Central Board of Trustees (CBT):**
  The apex decision-making body of the EPFO, chaired by the **Union Labour Minister**, and comprising representatives of employees, employers, and the government.

* **EPF Fund Composition:**

  * **Employee contribution:** 12% of basic salary + DA
  * **Employer contribution:** 12% (divided between EPF and EPS)
  * Amount earns **interest (currently 8.25%)** and can be withdrawn under specific conditions.

Earlier, withdrawals were complicated and **restricted mainly to employee contributions** for purposes like illness, marriage, education, or housing.

---

### 2. **The News**

* **When & Where:**
  October 13, 2025, in **New Delhi** — the **CBT of EPFO** approved major reforms in the withdrawal rules.

* **What happened:**
  The board **merged 13 existing withdrawal provisions** into **a single simplified framework** under three broad heads:

  1. **Essential needs** – illness, education, marriage
  2. **Housing needs** – buying, building, or repaying a home loan
  3. **Special circumstances** – emergencies, natural disasters, etc.

* **Key changes:**

  * Members can now withdraw **from both employee and employer contributions**, not just their own share.
  * Must **maintain a minimum balance of 25%** of the total PF corpus at all times.
  * **Withdrawal conditions tightened:**

    * Earlier: Full withdrawal possible **2 months after leaving a job**.
    * Now: Full withdrawal allowed only **after 12 months** of unemployment.
    * **75% can be withdrawn immediately**, remaining 25% after one year.
  * **Final pension** (under EPS) can be withdrawn **only after 36 months**, instead of the earlier 2 months.
  * Withdrawals for marriage or housing now allowed **after 1 year** of joining (earlier 5–7 years).
  * For **education/illness**, limits made more flexible.
  * Under “special circumstances,” the **full eligible amount** can be withdrawn **twice a year**.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Objective:**
  The government claims these changes aim to improve **“ease of living”** and ensure **long-term financial security** for workers.

* **Rationale:**

  * Frequent withdrawals disrupted **continuity of service records**, leading to **rejection of pension claims**.
  * Encourages accumulation of a **larger retirement corpus** through compounding interest.
  * Promotes **financial discipline** and prevents premature depletion of savings.

* **Broader context:**

  * The reforms align with **Digital EPFO** initiatives for ease of claim and grievance redressal.
  * EPFO interest rates have been maintained at **8.25% (FY 2024–25)** to encourage savings.
  * Fits within the broader vision of **social security reforms** under the **Code on Social Security, 2020**.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### **a) Issues & Challenges**

* **For Workers:**

  * Delay in full withdrawal affects job-losers needing immediate liquidity.
  * Mandatory 25% balance retention restricts access to their own savings.
  * Many low-income workers have **small PF balances (<₹20,000)**, making such restrictions burdensome.

* **For Employers:**

  * Easier withdrawals could increase administrative load and frequent processing.
  * Blurring the distinction between **long-term savings** and **short-term liquidity**.

* **For the System:**

  * Contradiction between promoting “ease of access” and enforcing “minimum balance.”
  * Risk of **politicization of provident fund policy**, impacting workers’ trust.
  * Could weaken **retirement security**, defeating the purpose of EPF.

#### **b) Impacts**

* **Economic:**

  * May reduce long-term savings rate, affecting investment capital.
  * Short-term liquidity could increase consumption spending.
* **Social:**

  * Could hurt low-income groups in emergencies if access is delayed.
* **Governance:**

  * Reflects the state’s dilemma between paternalistic protection vs. individual autonomy over savings.
* **Ethical:**

  * Raises questions on **ownership of workers’ savings** — should the state control when one can access their money?

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Balanced Approach:**

   * Combine **financial discipline** with **flexibility** — allow partial access for emergencies without stringent timelines.

2. **Tiered Withdrawal Policy:**

   * Differentiate between **low-income and high-income** workers; provide faster access for the former.

3. **Financial Literacy:**

   * Strengthen awareness about **retirement planning** and **compound growth** benefits of maintaining PF corpus.

4. **Emergency Liquidity Windows:**

   * Create a **temporary withdrawal option** during job loss, health crises, or natural disasters, backed by digital verification.

5. **Data Transparency & Review:**

   * EPFO should release **periodic impact reports** on withdrawal patterns, pension rejections, and member satisfaction.

6. **Trade Union Consultation:**

   * Involve worker representatives and employer bodies in **policy design** to maintain consensus and credibility.
