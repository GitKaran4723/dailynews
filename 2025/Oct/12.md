# How is the immune system kept in check?
## Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2025 — Discovery of Peripheral Immune Tolerance

---

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

#### **Immune System: A Quick Recap**

* The **immune system** protects the body from infections, foreign invaders, and cancer cells.
* However, if it **misidentifies the body’s own cells** as enemies, it can trigger **autoimmune diseases** (like Type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, etc.).
* Therefore, the immune system needs mechanisms to **“tolerate self”** — meaning, it should not attack the body’s own tissues.

#### **Immune Tolerance**

* **Central tolerance**: Happens in the **thymus gland**, where immature T cells that recognize “self” are eliminated.
* **Peripheral tolerance**: Occurs **outside the thymus**, involving a specialized class of cells — the **Regulatory T cells (Tregs)** — that **suppress harmful immune responses**.

#### **Regulatory T Cells (Tregs)**

* A **subset of T cells** identified by an additional surface protein called **CD25** and controlled by the **Foxp3 gene**.
* Their main function: **Prevent immune overreaction** and **autoimmune disorders** by “calming” the immune system after an attack.
* They act as **“peacekeepers”** that balance the immune army’s aggression with restraint.

---

### 2. **The News**

The **2025 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine** was awarded to:

* **Mary E. Brunkow (U.S.)**
* **Fred Ramsdell (U.S.)**
* **Shimon Sakaguchi (Japan)**

**For:**

> Their discoveries concerning *peripheral immune tolerance* — identifying **Regulatory T cells (Tregs)** and the **Foxp3 gene** that governs their development.

#### **Timeline & Key Contributions:**

* **1980s:**

  * Sakaguchi studied T cells in mice at the Aichi Cancer Center, Japan.
  * Observed that removing the **thymus** from newborn mice caused **autoimmune diseases**, suggesting a missing “immune regulator.”
* **1995:**

  * Sakaguchi discovered a new class of **T cells with the CD25 protein** — naming them **Regulatory T cells**.
* **Late 1990s–2000s:**

  * Brunkow and Ramsdell, at **Celltech Chiroscience (U.S.)**, discovered that mutations in the **Foxp3 gene** caused uncontrolled immune activity in certain mouse strains (and a rare human disorder, **IPEX syndrome**).
  * They demonstrated that **Foxp3 is essential** for the formation and function of Tregs.
* **2003 onwards:**

  * Sakaguchi’s lab confirmed that **Foxp3 directly controls Treg development**, establishing the mechanism of **peripheral immune tolerance**.

#### **Significance:**

* The discovery explained **how the immune system “knows” when to stop attacking**, preventing autoimmune disorders.
* It established the **molecular and cellular basis** of immune regulation — a landmark in immunology.

* **AIIMS and IITs** are conducting **translational research** in immuno-oncology, regenerative medicine, and T-cell therapy.
* **National Biopharma Mission (NBM)** encourages public–private partnerships for **cell-based therapies** — including immune-modulating treatments.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### **Issues and Challenges:**

* **Autoimmune diseases** remain poorly understood and difficult to treat.
* **Cancer immunotherapy** often faces the paradox — strengthening immune response without triggering autoimmunity.
* **Regulatory challenges** in approving cell-based or gene-editing therapies.
* **Ethical concerns** around manipulating the immune system.

#### **Impacts:**

* **Healthcare:** Opens new avenues for **personalized immunotherapy**, **autoimmune disease control**, and **transplant tolerance**.

* **Autoimmune therapy:** Enhancing Tregs can help manage diseases like lupus or Crohn’s disease.
* **Organ Transplantation:** Treg-based therapies can promote **immune acceptance** and reduce dependency on immunosuppressive drugs.
* **Scientific Paradigm Shift:** Moves medicine towards **“immune modulation”** rather than broad immune suppression.

#### **Ethical & Governance Dimensions:**

* Ensuring **safety and reversibility** of immune modulation.
* Balancing **research freedom** with **ethical oversight** in animal and human trials.

# What is macroscopic quantum tunnelling?
## Nobel Prize in Physics 2025 — Quantum Tunnelling in Superconducting Circuits

---

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

#### **Quantum Tunnelling:**

* In **quantum mechanics**, particles such as electrons can sometimes **pass through barriers** they classically shouldn’t be able to cross.
* Imagine a ball trying to roll over a hill — in classical physics, it needs enough energy to climb. But in the quantum world, there’s a small chance it can **“tunnel” through** the hill instead.
* This strange yet real effect is called **quantum tunnelling**, and it’s crucial in phenomena like **nuclear fusion in stars**, **radioactive decay**, and **semiconductor operation**.

#### **Superconductivity:**

* A **superconductor** is a material that allows **electrons (in pairs called Cooper pairs)** to flow **without resistance** when cooled below a critical temperature.
* These pairs behave like a **single quantum wave**, extending over macroscopic distances.

#### **Josephson Junction (Core Concept):**

* A **Josephson junction** is the fundamental unit in superconducting quantum circuits.
* It consists of **two superconductors separated by a very thin insulating layer**.
* Despite the insulator, **Cooper pairs** can tunnel through this barrier, creating a **supercurrent** even without applied voltage — a phenomenon predicted by **Brian Josephson (1962 Nobel Prize)**.
* The **phase difference** between the quantum waves on either side governs the tunnelling probability and thus the electrical properties of the junction.

---

### 2. **The News**

The **2025 Nobel Prize in Physics** was awarded jointly to:

* **John Clarke (U.S.)**
* **Michel Devoret (France/U.S.)**
* **John Martinis (U.S.)**

**For:**

> Demonstrating quantum tunnelling and discrete energy levels in macroscopic superconducting circuits — proving that **quantum mechanics applies at scales visible to the naked eye**.

#### **Key Discoveries:**

* The trio designed **Josephson junction circuits** where the **phase difference** acted like a **quantum particle**.
* They observed:

  * **Macroscopic quantum tunnelling** — the collective quantum wave of many electrons tunnelling through an energy barrier.
  * **Quantised energy levels** — the circuit’s energy states were discrete, not continuous, confirming quantum behaviour.

#### **How They Did It:**

* Built **ultra-sensitive, noise-free circuits** with **microwave shielding and cryogenic cooling** (close to absolute zero).
* Detected tunnelling events by measuring tiny voltage jumps as the system switched between energy states.
* When microwaves of the right frequency hit the junction, the system “jumped” between quantised energy levels — a direct fingerprint of quantum behaviour.

#### **Outcome:**

* Their work **proved that macroscopic systems can exhibit quantum properties**, bridging the gap between quantum physics and classical electronics.
* It laid the **foundation for modern superconducting qubits** — the backbone of **quantum computers** today.
