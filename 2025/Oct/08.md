## Preventive Detention and Democratic Dissent: The Case of Sonam Wangchuk and Ladakh

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Context:**
  The preventive detention of **Sonam Wangchuk**, a noted climate activist and education reformer from Ladakh, under the **National Security Act (NSA)** has reignited debates about **democratic freedoms, misuse of national security laws**, and the **right to peaceful protest** in India.

* **National Security Act (NSA), 1980:**

  * Allows the government to **detain individuals without trial** for up to **12 months** to prevent them from acting in a manner ‚Äúprejudicial to the security of the state or public order.‚Äù
  * Intended for **extraordinary situations**, but often criticised for being used to **curb dissent** rather than address genuine threats.
  * Preventive detention is a **constitutional exception** to the **right to liberty under Article 21** and is authorised under **Articles 22(3)‚Äì(7)** of the Constitution.

* **Ladakh‚Äôs Demands:**

  * **Statehood** and inclusion under the **Sixth Schedule** (Article 244(2) & 275(1)) of the Constitution ‚Äî to protect Ladakh‚Äôs **tribal identity, environment, and local autonomy**.
  * Ladakh became a **Union Territory without a legislature** after the **abrogation of Article 370** and **bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir in 2019**.
  * This left local communities feeling **politically disempowered** and **excluded from decision-making** about their fragile Himalayan ecosystem.

* **About Sonam Wangchuk:**

  * An engineer, innovator, and founder of the **Students‚Äô Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh (SECMOL)**.
  * Advocates for **sustainable Himalayan development**, **climate resilience**, and **democratic self-governance**.
  * His activism is **non-violent**, inspired by **Gandhian principles of satyagraha**.

### 2. **The News**

* **Event:**

  * The **Central Government invoked the National Security Act (NSA)** against **Sonam Wangchuk** following **peaceful protests** in Leh and Kargil demanding Statehood and Sixth Schedule protections for Ladakh.
* **Timeline:**

  * The protests witnessed sporadic violence and arson by a few elements, but Mr. Wangchuk was **not linked** to such activities.
  * Despite this, he was **detained under preventive detention laws**, sparking national and international criticism.
* **Judicial Context:**

  * The **Supreme Court**, in recent judgments (e.g., *Dhanya M. v. State of Kerala, 2025*; *S.K. Nazneen v. Telangana, 2023*), has drawn a **clear distinction between ‚Äúlaw and order‚Äù and ‚Äúpublic order‚Äù**, stating that preventive detention cannot be invoked for routine protests or dissent.
  * The use of NSA here, therefore, appears **legally disproportionate** and **constitutionally questionable**.
