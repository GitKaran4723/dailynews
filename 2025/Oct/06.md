## **Sir Creek Tensions and India’s Security Posture**

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

**What is Sir Creek?**

* **Sir Creek** is a **96-km-long tidal estuary** located between the **Kutch region of Gujarat (India)** and **Sindh province (Pakistan)**.
* It opens into the **Arabian Sea** and forms part of the **Indo-Pak maritime boundary**.
* The area is largely **uninhabited marshland**, crisscrossed by **shifting creeks, mudflats, and tidal channels**, making navigation extremely difficult.

**Historical Context:**

* The dispute dates back to **pre-Independence maps** (Bombay Presidency vs Sindh).
* India claims the **mid-channel line** as the boundary based on **international law for navigable waterways**.
* Pakistan claims the **eastern bank** as the boundary, citing the **1914 resolution between Sindh and Kutch** under the British.
* The issue has **economic, strategic, and legal implications**, especially concerning **oil and gas reserves** and **fishing rights**.
* Despite several rounds of **Indo-Pak talks (1969–2012)**, the dispute remains unresolved.

**Geographical Importance:**

* Lies between **the Gulf of Kutch (India)** and **the Indus Delta (Pakistan)**.
* Close to **Mundra and Kandla ports** — India’s major maritime trade hubs.
* Falls within the **Rann of Kutch**, a region that witnessed conflict during the **1965 Indo-Pak war**.

# Treat employment as a national priority
---

## **India’s Employment Imperative and the Need for a National Employment Policy**

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

**Key Concepts:**

* **Demographic Dividend:**
  Refers to the economic growth potential that can result from shifts in a population’s age structure—mainly when the working-age population (15–64 years) is larger than the non-working-age share.
  India’s demographic dividend window is **narrowing** — expected to **peak around 2043**, after which the population will age rapidly.

* **Employment Elasticity:**
  The responsiveness of employment growth to economic growth. India’s employment elasticity has declined over time, meaning high GDP growth is not translating into proportional job growth.

* **Labour Codes (2020):**
  Four consolidated laws —

  1. **Code on Wages**,
  2. **Code on Social Security**,
  3. **Industrial Relations Code**, and
  4. **Occupational Safety, Health, and Working Conditions Code** —
     aimed at simplifying and modernising labour regulations.

* **Gig Economy:**
  A system of short-term, flexible jobs typically facilitated by digital platforms (e.g., Swiggy, Zomato, Uber, etc.). It’s growing rapidly in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities.

---

### 2. **The News**

The **Confederation of Indian Industry (CII)** in its recent report on **“Policies for a Competitive India”** has emphasised that India must **treat employment generation as a national priority** to harness its **demographic dividend**.
Over the next 25 years, India will add **133 million people** to its working-age population — **18% of the global incremental workforce**.

However, without structural reforms, India risks facing a **“jobless growth”** scenario even as its demographic advantage fades by **2043**.

CII proposes an **Integrated National Employment Policy (INEP)** that aligns **industrial, education, trade, and labour policies** to achieve **quality job creation at scale**, along with reforms in the **gig economy, labour codes, and migration policy**.
