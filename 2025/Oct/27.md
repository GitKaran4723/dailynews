# Hands-off approach
## Rashtriya Vigyan Puraskar (RVP) 2025: Recognising Science, Debating Transparency

---

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Rashtriya Vigyan Puraskar (RVP):**
  Instituted in **2023**, the RVP is the **central government‚Äôs highest national recognition** for contributions in the field of science, technology, and innovation.

  * It replaced multiple departmental awards (like CSIR‚Äôs *Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Awards* and DST‚Äôs *National Awards*) to create a **unified national-level honour**.
  * It aims to mirror the **prestige of the Padma awards**, though exclusively for the scientific community.

* **Four Award Categories:**

  1. **Vigyan Ratna:** For **lifetime achievements** in science.
  2. **Vigyan Shri:** For **outstanding recent contributions**.
  3. **Vigyan Yuva‚ÄìShanti Swarup Bhatnagar Award:** For **scientists below 45 years**.
  4. **Vigyan Team Award:** For **collaborative efforts** in technology or innovation.

* **Administration:**

  * The awards are overseen by the **Office of the Principal Scientific Adviser (PSA)** to the Government of India.
  * Selections are made by the **Rashtriya Vigyan Puraskar Committee**, chaired by the PSA and including **Secretaries of major science departments** (DST, DBT, CSIR, MoES, ISRO, DRDO) and **members of scientific academies**.

---

### 2. **The News**

* On **October 2025**, the **Government of India announced 24 individual scientists and one team** as recipients of the **second edition** of the **Rashtriya Vigyan Puraskar (RVP)**.
* Categories remain the same as 2024 ‚Äî **Vigyan Ratna, Vigyan Shri, Vigyan Yuva‚ÄìSSB, and Vigyan Team Award**.
* Though up to **56 awards** can be given each year, the number is **lower than last year‚Äôs 33 awardees**, possibly reflecting **greater scrutiny**.
* **Key Developments:**

  * Awards were **delayed by several months**, possibly due to more rigorous selection or internal review.
  * **No cash prize** accompanies the RVP (unlike earlier science awards), aligning it with the **honorific nature of Padma awards**.
* **Controversies:**

  * In 2024, some shortlisted scientists had their names **withdrawn post-selection**, sparking concerns about **political interference**.
  * **Prominent scientists** had written to the PSA‚Äôs office seeking **transparency** in the selection process.
  * Critics argue that the **centralisation** of awards and ministerial oversight risk **politicising scientific recognition**.
  * The PSA‚Äôs office clarified that the committee *recommends* names to the **Minister for Science and Technology**, but it is unclear whether the Minister can modify or reject them.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Institutional Frameworks**

* **RVP‚Äôs Institutional Genesis (2022):**

  * The **Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA)** and heads of major science departments decided to **consolidate over 300 separate departmental awards** into one unified national framework.
  * The intent: to **enhance stature**, reduce duplication, and ensure **prestige and parity** with national honours like the **Padma Awards**.

* **Associated Ministries and Agencies:**

  * **Ministry of Science and Technology (MoST)**
  * **Department of Science and Technology (DST)**
  * **Department of Biotechnology (DBT)**
  * **Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)**
  * **Department of Space (ISRO)**, **DRDO**, and **MoES (Earth Sciences)**

* **Other National Science Awards:**

  * *Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar (SSB) Awards* (CSIR) ‚Äì Established 1958.
  * *Infosys Prize*, *INSA Awards*, and *Padma Awards* ‚Äì also recognise scientific excellence but vary in focus and administration.

* **Recent Reforms:**

  * The RVP aims to **streamline recognition**, prevent duplication, and **raise the national visibility** of science and technology awards.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### **Issues & Challenges:**

1. **Transparency Concerns:**

   * Opaque nomination and selection processes reduce credibility.
   * Allegations of **political bias or ideological influence** can undermine trust among scientists.

2. **Centralisation and Bureaucratisation:**

   * Moving award oversight under a single ministry risks **politicising decisions** that should be merit-based.

3. **Absence of Financial Incentives:**

   * While aligning with the Padma model enhances prestige, many believe **cash grants** motivate research and innovation.

4. **Impact on Scientific Morale:**

   * Perceived favoritism or ideological bias may **discourage young scientists** and **erode institutional integrity**.

5. **Evaluation Parameters:**

   * Need for clear, objective, and measurable criteria (e.g., research impact, innovation, patents, societal relevance).

#### **Positive Aspects:**

* **Unified and High-Prestige Framework:**

  * Streamlining awards under one banner provides **national visibility**.
* **Recognition Across Age and Discipline:**

  * Categories ensure both **senior and young scientists** get recognition.
* **Alignment with National Goals:**

  * Reinforces India‚Äôs push for **scientific self-reliance** under *Atmanirbhar Bharat* and *Viksit Bharat 2047*.

#### **Ethical and Governance Dimensions:**

* Ensuring **scientific autonomy** and **freedom of inquiry** is vital for innovation.
* **Meritocracy vs. Ideological Alignment**: Awards must reflect **excellence**, not conformity.
* Transparency and accountability are **ethical imperatives** in publicly funded recognition.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Ensure Transparency and Meritocracy:**

   * Publish **selection criteria and shortlists** post-award to build public trust.
   * Introduce **independent oversight committees** comprising eminent scientists from India and abroad.

2. **Decentralise Preliminary Evaluation:**

   * Allow **discipline-specific expert panels** to recommend names before the national committee‚Äôs review.

3. **Separate Politics from Science:**

   * Maintain a **hands-off approach** from the political executive.
   * Empower the **scientific community** to judge its peers, as is done in many global science awards (e.g., Nobel, Royal Society).

4. **Enhance Incentive Structure:**

   * While the award can remain non-monetary, provide **research grants or fellowships** for winners to continue impactful work.

5. **Promote Public Awareness of Science:**

   * Use the RVP platform to **popularize scientific achievements** among students and the public, fostering a **culture of innovation**.

6. **Regular Evaluation of the Award Framework:**

   * Conduct a **five-year review** of the RVP‚Äôs impact on scientific motivation and institutional integrity.

---

### üß≠ **Summary Insight**

The **Rashtriya Vigyan Puraskar (RVP)** marks a significant effort to **elevate the stature of Indian science awards**, but its credibility hinges on **transparency, independence, and merit-based selection**. Centralisation and political oversight, if unchecked, risk undermining scientific morale. For India‚Äôs scientific ecosystem to thrive, **recognition must remain apolitical and excellence-driven**, ensuring that the RVP becomes a true symbol of **scientific honour, not bureaucratic favour**.
