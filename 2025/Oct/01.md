# Labour of care
## Plight of Anshakalin Stri Parichars (ASPs) and Women Health Workers in Maharashtra

---

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Anshakalin Stri Parichars (ASPs)** are part-time women attendants working in Maharashtra‚Äôs rural health system.
* Their work predates the **ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activist)** program and **anganwadi workers**, making them one of the earliest forms of grassroots health support in India.
* Their duties include: assisting in childbirth, maintaining hygiene in primary health centers, supporting vaccination drives, maternal and child health services, and disease surveillance.
* Despite these responsibilities, ASPs are **not recognized as regular government employees**, leading to extremely low and stagnant wages.

**Key Terms:**

* **Minimum Wages Act, 1948:** Ensures workers are paid at least a government-set minimum wage.
* **ASHA Workers:** Introduced in 2005 under the **National Rural Health Mission (NRHM)** as community-based health workers.
* **Honorarium:** A token payment given to volunteers or workers not officially on payroll.

---

### 2. **The News**

* In Maharashtra, **ASPs have been earning just ‚Çπ3,000 per month since 2016**, with **no job security, pension, or travel allowance**.
* A **Nagpur Labour Court (2023)** held that ASPs should at least get wages under the **Minimum Wages Act**, but left implementation to the State government.
* The Maharashtra government **verbally assured** a wage increase to ‚Çπ6,000 by **December 2025**, still below what **multi-purpose health workers (MPHWs)** earn.
* ASPs have been holding **protests** across districts ‚Äî **Kolhapur, Nagpur, Ratnagiri, Yavatmal** ‚Äî demanding fair wages and recognition.
* Their struggle echoes that of **ASHA and anganwadi workers** nationwide, who face similar exploitation under the label of ‚Äúvolunteerism.‚Äù

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **National Rural Health Mission (2005):** Introduced ASHA workers as community-level health volunteers to bridge the gap between rural populations and the health system.
* **Minimum Wages Act, 1948:** Provides the legal framework for ensuring fair wages; however, many informal workers like ASPs remain excluded.
* **Unorganised Workers Social Security Act, 2008:** Offers social security to informal workers but is poorly implemented at the grassroots.
* **Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act, 2017:** Strengthened maternity leave provisions but not extended to contractual/voluntary workers.
* **State-level initiatives:** Some States (e.g., Kerala, Tamil Nadu) have begun recognizing and regularizing community health workers with fixed honoraria, unlike Maharashtra‚Äôs slow progress.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### **GS Paper 2: Governance / Social Justice / Health**

* **Issues & Challenges:**

  * **Gendered labour exploitation:** Women, especially from lower caste and rural backgrounds, perform essential health duties yet remain unpaid or underpaid.
  * **Lack of institutional recognition:** Health systems rely on ‚Äúvolunteers‚Äù without providing employment status or social security.
  * **Inequality in health administration:** Structural discrimination based on class, caste, and gender determines who gets valued as a ‚Äúworker.‚Äù
  * **Labour rights violations:** Non-implementation of Minimum Wages Act and unsafe working conditions.

#### **Impact Analysis:**

* **Social:** Deepens gender inequality and rural marginalisation.
* **Economic:** Undervalued labour leads to inefficiency and high attrition in public health delivery.
* **Administrative:** Weakens India‚Äôs public health infrastructure at the grassroots.
* **Ethical/Governance Angle:** Reflects ethical failure to ensure dignity of labour and equality before the law.

# Swim to safety
## **Dugong Conservation in India: Hope from the Palk Bay Reserve**

---

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

**Who are Dugongs?**

* Dugongs (*Dugong dugon*), often called **‚Äúsea cows‚Äù**, are **herbivorous marine mammals** closely related to manatees.
* They feed primarily on **seagrass meadows**, which are essential for their survival.
* They are classified as **‚ÄúVulnerable‚Äù** on the **IUCN Red List**, and listed under **Schedule I** of India‚Äôs **Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972** ‚Äî giving them the highest level of legal protection.

# Reclaim the district as a democratic commons
## **Reimagining India‚Äôs Growth through a District-First Democracy**

---

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

India is currently experiencing a **demographic window of opportunity**, with **65% of its population under 35 years**. This demographic dividend could make India a global economic powerhouse ‚Äî but only if young people are **productively employed and politically engaged**.

However, growth and opportunity in India have become **unevenly distributed**:

* **Cities (covering only 3% of land)** produce **over 60% of GDP**, while rural and district regions remain underutilised.
* **85% of Indians** live in the district of their birth, but have limited access to quality jobs, education, or participation in decision-making.

At the same time, India‚Äôs governance remains **highly centralised**, where national or state-level schemes dominate, leaving **local bodies and representatives** with minimal developmental agency. This has led to a **‚Äúdelivery state‚Äù model** ‚Äî efficient at transferring benefits but weak in creating opportunities.

**Key Concept:**
A *‚ÄúDistrict-first democracy‚Äù* envisions governance where **districts become the nucleus of participatory development**, linking local political leaders, citizens, and the private sector to co-create inclusive growth.

---

### 2. **The News**

* The article highlights India‚Äôs urgent need to **decentralise governance and revive district-level participation** as a means to address youth unemployment, political disengagement, and uneven growth.
* Despite technological and economic progress, **centralisation of decision-making** has narrowed **local political agency**.
* **Elected representatives** are often reduced to distributing welfare rather than shaping developmental priorities.
* To truly unlock India‚Äôs demographic dividend, the country must **reimagine the district** not just as an administrative unit, but as a **democratic commons** ‚Äî a space for civic collaboration and local innovation.
* This approach could make **accountability visible and measurable** at the district level, improve **resource allocation**, and **reconnect governance with people‚Äôs everyday lives**.

**Core Idea:**
India already has a **district-first bureaucracy**; it now needs a **district-first democracy** ‚Äî where policies, investments, and youth engagement converge locally.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Institutional Context**

**Constitutional & Institutional Background:**

* **73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments (1992):** Devolved powers to **Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs)** and **Urban Local Bodies (ULBs)**, creating a three-tier governance structure.
* **District Collector/DM system:** Anchors administration, but remains bureaucratically dominant rather than participatory.
* **District Planning Committees (Article 243ZD):** Envisioned to prepare integrated plans for district development, but often remain dormant or tokenistic.

**Existing Schemes Relevant to District Development:**

* **Aspirational Districts Programme (2018):** Focuses on improving socio-economic indicators in 112 backward districts using data-driven monitoring.
* **Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana (DAY-NRLM):** Promotes self-employment and rural livelihoods.
* **Digital India & e-Governance:** Enhances service delivery, but often lacks participatory mechanisms.
* **Skill India Mission:** Targets youth employability but needs localised implementation linked to district industries.

**Emerging Ideas:**

* Linking **MPs and MLAs** more closely with **district-level outcomes**.
* Encouraging **public-private partnerships** at the district level for skill, entrepreneurship, and infrastructure development.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### **GS Paper 2 ‚Äì Governance, Polity, and Social Justice**

**Issues & Challenges:**

1. **Centralised governance model:** Excessive focus on top-down schemes limits local innovation and accountability.
2. **Youth disillusionment:** Rising unemployment and lack of civic participation risk political alienation.
3. **Uneven economic geography:** Urban-centric growth leaves districts economically stagnant.
4. **Administrative inertia:** Districts function as bureaucratic nodes, not democratic platforms.
5. **Overdependence on welfare transfers:** Short-term relief without structural transformation.

**Implications:**

* **Political:** Weak local leadership undermines participatory democracy.
* **Economic:** Under-utilised human capital reduces productivity and domestic demand.
* **Social:** Growing urban-rural inequality fuels frustration and social fragmentation.
* **Ethical/Governance:** Governance becomes transactional (entitlement-based) instead of transformative (opportunity-based).

**Analytical Angle:**
A ‚Äúdistrict-first democracy‚Äù aligns with **decentralisation and participatory governance**, both of which are essential for:

* Harnessing the **demographic dividend**,
* Strengthening **local accountability**, and
* Achieving **inclusive, sustainable growth**.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Institutionalise District-Centric Governance**

   * Empower **District Planning Committees (DPCs)** with financial autonomy and data-driven authority.
   * Integrate local MPs, MLAs, civil society, and private sector into **District Development Forums**.

2. **Reorient Youth Policies**

   * Align **Skill India**, **Startup India**, and **Digital India** initiatives with **district employment ecosystems**.
   * Promote **district-level innovation hubs** and **rural incubation centres**.

3. **Democratic Deepening**

   * Strengthen **Panchayati Raj Institutions** with real fiscal devolution (as per the **14th and 15th Finance Commissions**).
   * Introduce **citizen report cards** and **local dashboards** for transparency and public participation.

4. **Bridging Urban-Rural Divides**

   * Encourage **district clusters** and **regional growth corridors** for balanced development.
   * Incentivise industries to invest in **Tier-II and Tier-III districts** through infrastructure and tax benefits.

5. **Shared Responsibility**

   * Involve the **top 10% ‚Äî corporates, policymakers, and academia** ‚Äî in district-level mentorship and development partnerships.
   * Foster a culture of **civic collaboration** beyond partisanship.

6. **Civic Education and Engagement**

   * Introduce programs in schools and colleges to promote **local governance literacy**.
   * Mobilise youth as **‚Äúdistrict development fellows‚Äù** to contribute to local planning and monitoring.

---

### ‚úÖ **Summary Insight**

India‚Äôs path to equitable and sustainable progress lies not in more centralised efficiency but in **democratic proximity** ‚Äî governance that listens, learns, and acts locally.
A **district-first democracy** would not only rejuvenate the economy but also **revive faith in India‚Äôs democratic project**, ensuring that the demographic dividend becomes a **democratic dividend**.
