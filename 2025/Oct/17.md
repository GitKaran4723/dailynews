# Trump and MEA at odds over Russian oil imports
## India–U.S. Differences Over Russian Oil Imports

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Background on Russian Oil Imports:**
  After the **Russia–Ukraine war (2022)**, Western countries imposed **economic sanctions** on Moscow, including restrictions on its **crude oil exports**.
  India, however, continued purchasing **discounted Russian oil** to meet its domestic energy needs, citing **energy security and market pragmatism**.

* **India’s Position:**

  * India imports about **85% of its crude oil needs**, making **supply diversification vital**.
  * The government’s stance: *India will buy oil from wherever it gets the best deal for its people.*
  * India’s purchases are **legal**, as it does not recognize unilateral Western sanctions that are not UN-mandated.

* **U.S. Position:**

  * The U.S. views India’s continued purchase of Russian oil as **undermining sanctions** aimed at isolating Moscow.
  * Under President **Donald Trump (2025)**, Washington has imposed **penalty tariffs** on certain Indian products, signaling its frustration.

---

# FSSAI says only WHO-approved products can be labelled as ORS
## FSSAI Bans Misuse of the Term “ORS” in Food Products

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS):**

  * A **scientifically formulated mixture of glucose and electrolytes** (sodium, potassium, chloride, citrate) used for treating **dehydration due to diarrhoea or heat stress**.
  * The **World Health Organisation (WHO)** and **UNICEF** standard formula (per litre of water):

    * Sodium chloride – 2.6 g
    * Glucose (anhydrous) – 13.5 g
    * Potassium chloride – 1.5 g
    * Trisodium citrate dihydrate – 2.9 g
  * The ratio of **glucose to sodium** and **osmolarity (~245 mOsm/L)** is critical for proper absorption.

* **Misuse in the Market:**

  * Several **fruit-based or sugar-rich drinks** were marketed as “ORS” or “energy rehydration solutions”, misleading consumers.
  * These products, often containing **excess sugar** and **insufficient electrolytes**, can **worsen dehydration**, especially in children.

# Ensure safeguards for India’s carbon market
## Decoupling Growth from Environmental Harm: India’s Carbon Market and the Justice Challenge

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **The Growth–Environment Paradox:**
  The industrial revolution–driven model of growth has propelled humanity beyond **planetary boundaries** — particularly in climate change, biodiversity loss, and land-use change.

  * Developed nations achieved prosperity through **carbon-intensive growth**, but this model is **unsustainable** for the planet.
  * For developing countries like India, **“degrowth”** (reducing output to cut emissions) is neither fair nor feasible, as they still battle **poverty, hunger, and development deficits**.
  * The alternative is **“decoupling”** — sustaining growth while reducing environmental impact through **clean energy, circular economy, and green technologies.**

* **Decoupling Explained:**

  * **Absolute decoupling:** Economic growth increases while total environmental impact falls.
  * **Relative decoupling:** Growth rises faster than emissions, but both still increase.
  * India’s policy focus is on achieving **absolute decoupling** through clean energy, sustainable agriculture, and ecosystem restoration.

* **Examples from India:**

  * **Solar energy** expansion (world’s 5th largest solar capacity).
  * **Micro-irrigation and climate-smart farming** to conserve water and soil health.
  * **Renewable energy transition** under Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) — 50% non-fossil energy capacity by 2030.

---

### 2. **The News**

* **Focus:** The article highlights the **promise and perils of carbon markets** as a tool for achieving green growth without injustice.
* **What Happened:**

  * India is developing its **Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS)**, under which emission-intensive sectors will have benchmarks and voluntary offset opportunities.
  * A **national registry and trading platform** will oversee carbon credit generation, trade, and retirement.
  * Draft methodologies exist for **biomass, compressed biogas, and low-emission rice cultivation.**
  * However, India’s agricultural carbon projects remain underdeveloped — only **4 of 64 projects** listed under Verra are registered.
* **Global Lessons:**

  * The **Northern Kenya Rangelands Carbon Project** and **Lake Turkana Wind Power Project** illustrate how top-down, poorly regulated carbon projects can **harm local land rights, exclude communities, and replicate colonial resource control.**
  * These failures serve as a **warning for India**, where customary land rights and marginalised farmer communities could face similar risks if safeguards are weak.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **India’s Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS):**

  * Launched under the **Energy Conservation (Amendment) Act, 2022**.
  * Overseen by the **Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE)** and the **Ministry of Power**.
  * Objective: Create a **domestic carbon market** that rewards emission reductions and offsets.
  * Two key components:

    1. **Compliance mechanism** for industrial sectors.
    2. **Voluntary carbon market** for agriculture, forestry, and renewables.

* **Other Climate & Sustainability Efforts:**

  * **National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC)** – includes missions on solar energy, energy efficiency, and sustainable agriculture.
  * **Green Credit Programme (2023)** – under the Environment Ministry, encourages voluntary pro-environmental activities.
  * **India’s Updated NDC (2022):**

    * Reduce emission intensity by **45% by 2030** (from 2005 levels).
    * Achieve **net zero by 2070.**

* **Global Frameworks:**

  * **Paris Agreement (Article 6):** Allows carbon trading across nations to meet emission goals.
  * **REDD+** (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) under UNFCCC – promotes forest carbon credits.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### **a) Issues & Challenges**

* **Environmental Justice Concerns:**

  * Carbon markets can **reproduce colonial patterns of land control** — where corporations or foreign investors profit, while local communities bear costs.
  * Projects risk excluding **marginalised farmers, tribals, and forest dwellers**, especially where land titles are unclear.

* **Weak Safeguards:**

  * India’s CCTS lacks explicit provisions for **Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC)** and **benefit-sharing mechanisms.**
  * Developers are not required to disclose revenue-sharing or involve local stakeholders transparently.

* **Measurement & Credibility Issues:**

  * Disputes over how much carbon is actually sequestered or avoided (e.g., flawed soil carbon measurement in Kenya).
  * Verification delays and data opacity reduce market trust.

* **Power Asymmetries:**

  * Small farmers often lack awareness or bargaining power to negotiate fair contracts with carbon credit intermediaries.

* **Regulatory Trade-Off:**

  * Overregulation could discourage investment; underregulation risks exploitation — a delicate balance must be struck.

#### **b) Impacts**

* **Economic:**

  * Carbon markets can create a **new revenue stream** for farmers and local communities.
  * May attract **foreign climate finance** into India’s rural economy.

* **Social:**

  * Without equity safeguards, carbon projects may **alienate communities**, **disrupt commons**, and **worsen caste and class divides.**

* **Environmental:**

  * If poorly implemented, projects could **monocrop plantations** or **exclude biodiversity**, undermining genuine ecological goals.

* **Governance:**

  * Calls for institutional capacity to balance **market growth with ethical oversight.**

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Institutionalise FPIC (Free, Prior and Informed Consent):**

   * Make community consent **mandatory** before any land-based carbon project.

2. **Formalise Benefit-Sharing:**

   * Establish a **minimum revenue-sharing ratio** (e.g., 60% to community beneficiaries).
   * All contracts should be **publicly disclosed** on the carbon registry.

3. **Independent Verification & Transparency:**

   * Strengthen **MRV (Monitoring, Reporting, Verification)** protocols using **satellite data and blockchain** for credibility.

4. **Decentralised Governance:**

   * Involve **Panchayati Raj Institutions, Forest Rights Committees, and local NGOs** in project design and oversight.

5. **Adaptive Regulation:**

   * Create a **“light but firm” regulatory framework** — reducing red tape but enforcing accountability.

6. **Community Capacity-Building:**

   * Provide **training and technical assistance** to small farmers and tribal groups to engage meaningfully in carbon trading.

7. **Learning from Global Models:**

   * Incorporate lessons from Kenya, Peru, and Brazil on **community-led carbon projects** rooted in equity and transparency.

8. **Integrate with Development Goals:**

   * Align carbon credit projects with **SDG 13 (Climate Action)**, **SDG 1 (No Poverty)**, and **SDG 15 (Life on Land)** for holistic outcomes.

---

### 🌱 **Conclusion**

India stands at a crucial juncture — capable of leading the **Global South’s transition** toward green growth. But achieving this requires not only **carbon efficiency**, but also **climate justice**. The carbon market must evolve into a tool for **empowerment, not exploitation** — one that protects land rights, ensures fair distribution of benefits, and builds **trust-based, community-led climate action**.

# Restoring fiscal space for the States
## India’s Post-GST Fiscal Landscape and the Debate on States’ Fiscal Autonomy

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Goods and Services Tax (GST):**

  * Introduced in **July 2017** under the **101st Constitutional Amendment**, GST subsumed multiple indirect taxes (Central excise, VAT, service tax, etc.) into a **unified destination-based tax**.
  * GST is jointly administered by the **Centre and the States** through the **GST Council**, as per **Article 279A**.
  * The reform aimed to simplify taxation, curb cascading effects, and boost revenue through a **common market**.

* **Compensation Mechanism:**

  * To reassure States (who lost some fiscal powers), the Centre guaranteed **compensation for 5 years (2017–2022)** for any **revenue shortfall below 14% annual growth**.
  * This was funded by the **GST Compensation Cess** on luxury and sin goods.
  * As of **2025**, this cess has now been **abolished and merged with regular GST**, signaling the **end of the compensation era**.

* **Why the Debate Now:**

  * The **latest GST slab restructuring** promises **₹2 lakh crore** in tax benefits to consumers.
  * However, **States fear** revenue losses and **erosion of fiscal autonomy**, as the GST Council decisions are dominated by the Centre.
  * Some States demand a **revised fiscal sharing formula** to restore “**cooperative federalism**.”

---

### 2. **The News**

* **What Happened:**

  * The **GST Council’s new restructuring of tax slabs** aims to simplify rates and stimulate consumption.
  * The **abolition of the compensation cess** marks a major structural shift in India’s tax architecture.
  * The Centre expects higher demand and indirect revenue growth to offset losses, but **States remain skeptical**.

* **Key Concerns of States:**

  * Lack of **transparent estimation** of the expected revenue loss.
  * Decline in **fiscal autonomy** and heavy dependence on Central transfers.
  * Growing asymmetry between **taxation powers (centralised)** and **expenditure responsibilities (decentralised)**.
  * Unequal flow of grants and **non-shareable cess/surcharge revenues** retained by the Centre.

* **Recent Trends:**

  * **Cess and surcharge collections** (non-shareable) reached ₹4.23 lakh crore (BE 2025–26).
  * Despite Finance Commission recommendations, **actual devolution** as a % of gross tax revenue is declining.
  * **Central transfers** form **44% of States’ revenue receipts**, ranging from **72% in Bihar** to **20% in Haryana**, reflecting fiscal imbalance.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Institutional Framework**

* **Constitutional Provisions:**

  * **Article 246 & 246A:** Define taxation powers; GST gives concurrent taxing powers to both Centre and States.
  * **Articles 268–293:** Outline financial relations and distribution of revenue.
  * **Article 280:** Provides for the **Finance Commission (FC)** to recommend devolution and grants.

* **Evolution of Tax Sharing:**

  * **80th Amendment (2000):** Introduced *global sharing* of central taxes instead of sharing individual taxes.
  * **Finance Commissions:**

    * 11th FC (2000–05): 29.5% share to States.
    * 12th FC (2005–10): 30.5%.
    * 13th FC (2010–15): 32%.
    * 14th FC (2015–20): 42% (revised to 41% post-2019 due to J&K reorganisation).
  * However, actual devolution has fallen due to **rising cesses and surcharges**, which are **excluded** from the divisible pool.

* **GST Council’s Role:**

  * Functions as a **federal fiscal body**, but the **Centre holds one-third voting power**, often decisive.
  * Responsible for **tax rates, exemptions, and procedural rules** — shifting practical fiscal control to the Union.

* **Post-GST Expenditure Pattern:**

  * Pre-GST: Centre spent 47%, States 53%.
  * Post-GST: Centre 48%, States 52%.
  * Yet, States’ spending obligations (law & order, health, education, agriculture, local governance) remain higher.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### **a) Issues & Challenges**

* **Erosion of Fiscal Autonomy:**
  GST has **centralised indirect taxation**, reducing States’ power to design fiscal policy suited to local needs.

* **Dependence on Centre:**
  Central transfers and CSS (Centrally Sponsored Schemes) have increased, leading to **vertical imbalance**.

* **Cess and Surcharge Proliferation:**

  * These levies are **outside the divisible pool**, limiting States’ share in central revenues.
  * Funds are often used to finance **Central schemes**, increasing discretion and politicisation.

* **Disparity Among States:**

  * Progressive States (Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Karnataka) argue they are **penalised** for better performance.
  * High-dependence States (Bihar, UP, MP) face **structural deficits** and low fiscal capacity.

* **Federal Tensions:**

  * Opposition-ruled States allege **political bias** in fund allocation and delayed GST compensation.
  * Rising calls for **“fiscal federalism reform”** echo across State finance departments.

#### **b) Impacts**

* **Economic:**

  * Short-term stimulus expected due to lower consumer taxes.
  * Long-term risk of **State fiscal stress** and **budget constraints** for welfare and capital expenditure.

* **Governance:**

  * Growing **asymmetry between responsibility and resources** undermines efficiency in public service delivery.

* **Political:**

  * Fiscal centralisation may **strain Centre–State relations**, especially under differing political leaderships.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Revisit Fiscal Devolution Formula:**

   * The **16th Finance Commission** (2025–30) should consider higher **horizontal and vertical devolution**, and include **cess and surcharge** revenues in the shareable pool.

2. **Enhance States’ Tax Autonomy:**

   * Allow States limited flexibility to **levy top-up taxes** on **personal income or GST slabs**, similar to **Canada’s model**.

3. **Transparent and Predictable Transfers:**

   * Create an **automatic transfer mechanism** for GST revenue sharing to reduce payment delays and friction.

4. **Rationalise Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS):**

   * Reduce duplication and provide **greater design autonomy** to States in implementing schemes.

5. **Institutional Reforms:**

   * Strengthen the **GST Council’s consultative character** to ensure equal representation and reduce perception of Central dominance.

6. **Diversify State Revenue Sources:**

   * Encourage States to expand **non-tax revenue**, leverage **public-private partnerships**, and reform **State GST compliance** systems.

7. **Empower Subnational Governance:**

   * Decentralise fiscal powers to local governments for efficient delivery and **bottom-up financial planning.**

8. **Data Transparency:**

   * Publish detailed **Centre–State fiscal flow reports** and **GST compensation audit statements** to build trust in cooperative federalism.

---

### 🧭 **Conclusion**

India’s GST reform was a landmark in **economic integration**, but it also deepened the **centralisation of fiscal power**. As compensation ends and new tax structures emerge, the Centre must now restore the **spirit of cooperative federalism** through fair revenue sharing and institutional trust.

A balanced fiscal framework — where **States have adequate resources and autonomy** — is essential not only for effective governance but also for sustaining **India’s inclusive and decentralized growth model.**
