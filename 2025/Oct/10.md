# Karnataka State nod for one day paid menstrual leave in govt., pvt. sectors.
---

## Karnataka Menstrual Leave Policy – 2025

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Menstrual Leave Policy:**
  A workplace policy that allows menstruating employees to take paid leave during their menstrual cycle without any loss of wages or workdays. It acknowledges menstruation as a biological and health-related factor impacting productivity and comfort.

* **Context in India:**

  * Currently, there is *no national-level legislation* mandating menstrual leave in India.
  * Some **States** (Odisha, Bihar, Kerala) and **private companies** have their own policies, but these vary widely in scope and implementation.
  * The **Karnataka policy** is the **first in India** to cover both **government and private sectors**, ensuring inclusivity across employment categories.

---

### 2. **The News**

* **What Happened:**
  The **Karnataka State Cabinet** approved the **Karnataka Menstrual Leave Policy, 2025**, allowing **one day of paid leave per month** for women employees across **government and private sectors**.

* **When:**
  Announced on **Thursday (October 2025)**.

* **Who Was Involved:**

* **Comparative Context:**

  * **Bihar & Odisha:** Menstrual leave for government employees only.
  * **Kerala:** Universities grant leave for female students.
  * **Karnataka:** *First state to extend policy to private employees as well.*

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Existing National Provisions:**

  * *Factories Act, 1948* and *Maternity Benefit Act, 1961* — protect women’s health and workplace rights but do not mention menstrual leave.
  * *Code on Social Security, 2020* — integrates maternity provisions but excludes menstrual health benefits.
  * *POSH Act, 2013* — ensures safe and dignified workplaces for women.

* **Relevant Policies and Developments:**

  * *Kerala Menstrual Leave for University Students (2023):* Granted additional 2% attendance relaxation.
  * *Menstrual Hygiene Scheme (MHS):* Under National Health Mission — provides sanitary pads to adolescent girls.
  * *National Policy for Women (Draft 2016):* Advocates workplace inclusion and gender-sensitive labour policies.
  * *Health and Wellness Centres (HWCs):* Promote menstrual hygiene and reproductive health awareness.

* **International Examples:**

  * *Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Indonesia* — have national menstrual leave laws.
  * *Spain (2023)* — became the first European country to legalize paid menstrual leave.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### **Issues and Challenges**

* **Implementation Gaps:** Ensuring compliance in private sectors; potential reluctance by employers.
* **Workplace Stigma:** Social taboos may discourage women from availing leave.
* **Gender Discrimination:** Fear that employers may avoid hiring women due to perceived “extra leave.”
* **Absence of Central Framework:** Lack of nationwide uniformity may create policy disparities among states.

#### **Impacts**

* **Social:** Promotes menstrual dignity, reduces stigma, and supports gender-sensitive workplace environments.
* **Health:** Improves reproductive health outcomes by allowing rest during painful or heavy menstrual cycles.
* **Economic:** Short-term productivity loss offset by long-term gains in employee well-being and retention.
* **Governance:** Sets a precedent for other states and possibly the Centre to adopt inclusive labour reforms.

#### **Ethical & Gender Justice Perspective**

* Reinforces **Article 14 (Right to Equality)** and **Article 42 (Just and humane conditions of work)** of the Constitution.
* Aligns with **SDG 5 (Gender Equality)** and **SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being)**.
* Reflects principles of **feminist governance** and **inclusive labour justice**.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Legislative Backing:**
   The Karnataka government should enact a **Menstrual Leave Act** to ensure legal enforceability and prevent employer non-compliance.

2. **Central Framework:**

## Kerala’s Wildlife (Protection) Amendment Bill, 2025 — Federalism and Environmental Governance

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972:**
  A central legislation providing legal protection to wild animals and plants. It classifies species into *Schedules I–VI* based on their level of protection.

  * *Schedule I & II (Part I)*: Highest protection (no hunting).
  * *Schedule V*: “Vermin” species that may be hunted (e.g., rats, crows).
  * *Section 62:* Empowers the **Central Government** to declare any wild animal (from Schedule II) as *vermin* for a specific area and period, allowing their culling.

* **“Vermin” Declaration:**
  An animal declared *vermin* loses its protected status temporarily — enabling killing or capture to protect crops, life, or property.

* **Federal Context:**

  * **Wildlife** is a subject under the *Concurrent List (List III)* — both Centre and States can make laws, but the Central law prevails in case of conflict.
  * States require **Presidential assent** if their law contradicts the Central Act.
  * The tension lies between **centralized environmental regulation** and **state-specific ecological realities**.

---

### 2. **The News**

* **What Happened:**
  The **Kerala Legislative Assembly** passed the **Wild Life (Protection) (Kerala Amendment) Bill, 2025**, aiming to give the State the authority to declare certain animals as *vermin* — a power currently vested in the **Union Government** under Section 62 of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972.

* **Key Provisions of the Bill:**

  1. **State Power to Declare Vermin:**
     Allows the State to determine when a *Schedule II* animal has become a nuisance and declare it *vermin* for certain regions and periods.
  2. **Chief Wildlife Warden Empowerment:**
     Authorizes the Chief Wildlife Warden to *order killing, tranquilizing, capturing, or translocating* an animal that has gravely injured a person.
  3. **Rationale:**
     Frequent **human–wildlife conflicts**, especially involving **wild boars**, have resulted in deaths, injuries, and crop loss across Kerala’s forest-fringe regions.

* **Context:**
  Kerala’s repeated requests to the Centre to declare **wild boar as vermin** were not approved. Hence, the State sought to assert its autonomy through this amendment.

* **Wider Implication:**
  The Bill challenges the traditional **centralized model** of environmental decision-making, framing a **federal assertion** of ecological governance.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Central Measures:**

  * *Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972* — Main legal framework.
  * *Project Elephant* and *Project Tiger* — Focused on conservation and conflict management.
  * *National Board for Wildlife (NBWL):* Advises on wildlife policies and approvals.
  * *Eco-Sensitive Zones (ESZs):* Buffer areas to minimize human-animal conflicts.
  * *Compensation Schemes:* For crop and property loss due to wildlife.

* **State-Level Measures (Kerala):**

  * *Rapid Response Teams (RRTs)* for managing conflict zones.
  * *Compensation Programs* for crop loss due to wild boar and elephants.
  * *Wildlife Corridor Management* and *Tranquilization Protocols*.
  * *People’s Biodiversity Registers (PBRs):* Local-level ecological documentation.

* **Constitutional Provisions:**

  * *Article 48A:* State shall protect and improve the environment and wildlife.
  * *Article 51A(g):* Fundamental duty of every citizen to protect nature and wildlife.
  * *Concurrent List Entry 17B:* Forests and wildlife fall under concurrent jurisdiction.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### **Issues and Challenges**

1. **Federal Tension:**

   * Central veto (under Section 62) limits state responsiveness to local crises.
   * Kerala’s amendment raises constitutional questions of *repugnancy* and *Presidential assent*.

2. **Ecological Risks:**

   * Risk of *normalizing lethal responses* (culling) without addressing root causes like habitat loss, crop encroachment, and poor waste management.
   * Could undermine conservation ethics and international commitments under the **Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)**.

3. **Governance Deficit:**

   * Both Centre and State accused of *opacity* and *delay* — lacking transparent criteria for declaring species as vermin.
   * Weak institutional mechanisms for *non-lethal conflict mitigation* (fencing, compensation, relocation).

4. **Ethical and Legal Dimensions:**

   * Raises questions of *animal rights vs. human livelihood security*.
   * Judicial scrutiny likely under *Article 21 (Right to Life)* and *Article 48A* principles.

#### **Impacts**

* **Positive:**

  * May empower States to act swiftly in genuine conflict zones.
  * Enhances federal responsiveness to region-specific ecological pressures.

* **Negative:**

  * Risk of arbitrary culling and ecological imbalance.
  * Could set a precedent for other States to bypass conservation norms.

* **Broader Governance Impact:**

  * Deepens debate on *cooperative federalism* in environmental governance.
  * Highlights the need for a *shared decision-making mechanism* between Centre and States.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Cooperative Federalism Model:**
   Establish a **joint Centre-State Wildlife Conflict Authority** to evaluate local ecological data and approve time-bound, science-based interventions.

2. **Data-Driven Decision-Making:**
   Use *GIS mapping, camera traps, and field data* to determine population pressures before declaring any species as vermin.

3. **Non-Lethal Conflict Management:**
   Promote **barrier fencing, sound repellents, controlled lighting, compensation**, and **crop insurance** as alternatives to culling.

4. **Transparent Criteria & Public Participation:**
   Create **publicly available guidelines** for vermin declaration with inputs from ecologists, forest officers, and local communities.

5. **Legal Safeguards:**
   Any state amendment must **retain baseline protections** of the Central Act and seek **Presidential assent** to avoid repugnancy under Article 254(2).

6. **Reward Coexistence:**
   Design **incentive-based schemes** — such as compensation bonuses for non-lethal mitigation or biodiversity stewardship at local levels.

7. **Long-Term Vision:**
   Treat wildlife conflict as a **symptom of ecological imbalance**, not merely an administrative nuisance — integrating land use planning, habitat restoration, and rural livelihoods.

## India’s Escalating Mental Health and Suicide Crisis – A National Emergency

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Mental Health:**
  Refers to an individual’s emotional, psychological, and social well-being — influencing how one thinks, feels, and acts. Mental health affects decision-making, relationships, productivity, and resilience.

* **Suicide:**
  The act of intentionally causing one’s own death, often rooted in severe mental distress, social isolation, financial pressure, or psychological illness. It is a **public health and governance issue**, not merely a personal tragedy.

* **Key Concepts:**

  * **Mental Health Gap:** The difference between people needing care and those actually receiving it.
  * **Stigma:** Social prejudice that prevents people from seeking help.
  * **Treatment Gap in India:** Ranges between **70–92%**, meaning the majority of those suffering receive no formal care.
  * **Mental Healthcare Act, 2017:** Decriminalized suicide and mandated access to affordable, quality mental health care.
  * **National Suicide Prevention Strategy (2022):** Aims to reduce suicide mortality by 10% by 2030.
