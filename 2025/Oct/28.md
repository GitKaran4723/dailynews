## **Cyclone Montha**

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Cyclone:** A cyclone is a large-scale air mass that rotates around a strong center of low atmospheric pressure. In the Indian Ocean region, such storms are called **tropical cyclones**.
* **Classification:** Cyclones are categorized by wind speed:

  * **Depression:** < 63 km/h
  * **Cyclonic Storm:** 63–88 km/h
  * **Severe Cyclonic Storm:** 89–117 km/h
  * **Very Severe Cyclonic Storm:** 118–165 km/h, etc.
* **Formation:** They form over warm ocean waters (above 26°C) where moist air rises, creating a low-pressure zone that pulls in surrounding air, intensifying the system.
* **IMD (India Meteorological Department):** The official agency responsible for forecasting and monitoring cyclones in India, under the Ministry of Earth Sciences.
* **Alerts:**

  * **Yellow:** Be updated.
  * **Orange:** Be prepared.
  * **Red:** Take action (highest level warning).

# SIR 2.0 to begin in 12 States, U.T.s, cover 51 crore voters
---

## **Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of Voter Lists – Phase II**

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Election Commission of India (ECI):**
  A **constitutional body** (Article **324**) responsible for conducting free and fair elections to Parliament, State Legislatures, and the offices of the President and Vice-President of India.

* **Electoral Roll (Voter List):**
  An official list of all eligible voters in a constituency. It ensures **universal adult suffrage** (Article **326**) — meaning every citizen aged **18 years and above** has the right to vote, provided they are not disqualified under the law.

* **Special Intensive Revision (SIR):**
  This is a **comprehensive verification** exercise undertaken by the ECI to update and correct electoral rolls —

  * Addition of new voters (those who turned 18).
  * Deletion of deceased or shifted voters.
  * Correction of errors in names, addresses, or photographs.
  * Verification of citizenship and eligibility.

* **Why It Matters:**
  Accurate voter lists ensure the integrity of elections and prevent **bogus voting** or **disenfranchisement**.

---

### 2. **The News**

* **What Happened:**
  The **Election Commission of India (ECI)** has **launched the second phase** of the **Special Intensive Revision (SIR)** of electoral rolls across **12 States and Union Territories**, covering nearly **51 crore voters**.

* **When & Where:**
  Announced on **Monday**, the revision takes effect immediately, and the **voter lists are frozen from Monday midnight** to maintain consistency during the revision process.

* **States & UTs Involved:**

  * **Poll-bound States:** Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Kerala, Puducherry
  * **Others:** Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep

* **Exception – Assam:**
  No SIR will be held in **Assam** for now. A **separate order** will be issued later because the **citizenship verification process**, conducted under **Supreme Court supervision**, is still underway as part of the **NRC (National Register of Citizens)** process.

* **Chief Election Commissioner’s Statement:**
  Gyanesh Kumar clarified that under the **Citizenship Act**, Assam follows special provisions, and therefore, the June 24 nationwide SIR order does **not apply** there.

* **Political Context:**
  The SIR will draw particular attention in **West Bengal** and **Tamil Nadu**, where the **Trinamool Congress** and **DMK** have raised concerns about possible manipulation or discrepancies in voter lists.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Institutional Mechanisms**

# Big Tech’s contempt for Indian public health
---

## **Drug Advertisements, Big Tech, and India’s Regulatory Challenges**

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act, 1954 (DMRA):**

  * Enacted to **prohibit misleading advertisements** of drugs and remedies claiming magical or miraculous properties.
  * Covers **54 medical conditions**, including diabetes, cancer, sexual impotence, etc.
  * The law bans **all advertisements** claiming cures for these conditions, even if the drug is approved by a regulator.
  * Objective: **Protect public health** and prevent exploitation through false medical claims.

* **Why Drug Advertising Matters:**

  * Misleading health claims can result in **self-medication, misuse, and delayed treatment**.
  * India has a high rate of **self-prescription** and growing **alternative medicine markets (Ayurveda, Homeopathy, Unani)**.
  * Unregulated online advertisements worsen the problem, especially when they **bypass Indian oversight**.

* **Big Tech and Advertising:**

  * Platforms like **Google, Meta (Facebook/Instagram), YouTube, and Amazon** have become **major advertising hubs**.
  * These platforms act as **publishers** when they sell targeted ad spaces, not merely intermediaries.
  * Global corporations often follow **stricter ad policies in the U.S.** than in **developing countries like India**.

---

### 2. **The News**

* **Historical Background:**

  * Discussion on drug regulation in India dates back to **1927**, initiated by **Sir Haroon Jaffer**.
  * However, effective legislation came only in **1954** with the enactment of the **DMRA**.

* **Modern Problem – Internet Advertising:**

  * With the rise of **Big Tech platforms**, drug-related advertisements have shifted from newspapers and radio to **digital media**.
  * The **Drugs and Magic Remedies Act (1954)** has become **outdated**, as it did not anticipate online, algorithm-driven advertising.

* **Current Violations:**

  * Big Tech platforms routinely display **sponsored ads** for products that **claim to cure diseases like diabetes, hypertension, or cancer** through **Ayurveda, homeopathy, or cow-urine–based remedies**.
  * None of these are permissible under the **DMRA**, yet these ads proliferate.
  * These same platforms **do not run similar ads in the U.S.**, where **stringent FDA rules** and **criminal liability** deter violations.

* **Reasons for Violation:**

  1. **Contempt and neglect of Indian regulations** — a continuation of corporate disregard seen since the **Union Carbide (Bhopal Gas Tragedy)** era.
  2. **Weak enforcement** — especially after **judicial leniency** in earlier cases like violations of the **Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition of Sex Selection) Act, 1994 (PNDT Act)**.
  3. **Legal loopholes and jurisdictional challenges** — Indian subsidiaries cannot be easily prosecuted; U.S. executives are beyond India’s jurisdiction.

* **Judicial Context:**

  * A **Public Interest Litigation (PIL)** filed in 2008 on **PNDT Act violations** by Big Tech dragged on for nine years, resulting only in formation of a **government committee**, not prosecutions.
  * Courts failed to impose **criminal liability** under existing laws, emboldening platforms to continue violations.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Institutional Mechanisms**

* **Key Legislations:**

  * **Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act, 1954**
  * **Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940**
  * **Consumer Protection Act, 2019** – Section 21 empowers the government to penalize misleading ads and hold endorsers liable.
  * **Information Technology Act, 2000** – Provides conditional “intermediary immunity” under Section 79.
  * **PNDT Act, 1994** – Bans advertisements related to sex selection.

* **Regulatory Bodies:**

  * **Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO)** – Regulates drugs and approvals.
  * **Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW)** – Oversees drug safety.
  * **Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY)** – Regulates online intermediaries.
  * **Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI)** – Self-regulatory body monitoring misleading ads.

* **Recent Reforms and Efforts:**

  * **Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023:** Introduces accountability for digital platforms.
  * **Proposed Digital India Act (under draft):** Expected to redefine intermediary liability.
  * **Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA):** Can issue notices against misleading health claims.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### **Issues and Challenges**

* **Regulatory Lag:**
  DMRA (1954) is outdated and not designed for online advertising ecosystems.

* **Corporate Evasion:**
  Big Tech claims to be an “intermediary” rather than a “publisher”, avoiding liability despite actively selling and approving ads.

* **Weak Enforcement:**
  Slow judicial response and lack of criminal prosecution reduce deterrence.

* **Health and Safety Risks:**
  Misleading ads promote self-medication and can delay proper treatment, worsening public health outcomes.

* **Jurisdictional Gaps:**
  Indian authorities find it difficult to hold **foreign corporate executives** accountable.

* **Sociocultural Factors:**
  High trust in **Ayurveda**, **homeopathy**, and “nationalist health narratives” make people more susceptible to misleading ads.

#### **Impacts**

* **Public Health:** Increased risks from unverified drugs and loss of faith in scientific medicine.
* **Economic:** Growth of an unregulated, informal drug market.
* **Legal:** Weakening of Indian regulatory sovereignty over global platforms.
* **Ethical:** Exploitation of public trust, especially among vulnerable and illiterate populations.

#### **Governance Concerns**

* **Accountability vacuum** between global platforms and Indian law enforcement.
* **Digital sovereignty issue:** India’s inability to enforce its laws equally on foreign corporations.
* **Need for uniform international standards** for digital advertising and health claims.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Legal Reforms:**

   * **Amend the DMRA (1954)** to explicitly cover **digital advertising** and **cross-border online content**.
   * Define clear **liability for platforms** publishing paid health-related advertisements.

2. **Stronger Enforcement:**

   * Register **criminal cases** against top management of platforms violating DMRA.
   * Mandate **Indian-resident compliance officers** for ad content and consumer protection (similar to IT Rules 2021).

3. **Regulatory Mechanisms:**

   * Create an **independent digital advertising regulator** under the Consumer Protection framework.
   * Integrate **AI-based ad monitoring** tools to detect banned medical claims automatically.

4. **Accountability Measures:**

   * If Big Tech refuses compliance, **revoke intermediary immunity** for health-related advertisements.
   * Require **real-time data access** for government monitoring of online ads.

5. **Public Awareness:**

   * Nationwide campaigns to educate citizens about **misleading medical claims**.
   * Encourage **fact-checking collaborations** between the government, civil society, and media.

6. **International Cooperation:**

   * Bilateral agreements to ensure **extradition and compliance** in cross-border corporate violations.
   * Participate in **global digital governance frameworks** to standardize ad ethics.

# A start for North-South carbon market cooperation
---

## **EU–India New Strategic Agenda and the Carbon Market–CBAM Linkage**

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Carbon Market / Carbon Trading:**
  A system where carbon credits are bought and sold. Each credit represents the right to emit **one tonne of CO₂ (or equivalent greenhouse gases)**.

  * **Cap-and-trade model:** The government sets a cap on emissions. Companies emitting less than their quota can sell unused credits; those emitting more must buy them.
  * The goal is to **incentivize emission reductions** while maintaining flexibility for industry.

* **EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS):**

  * Established in **2005**, it is the **world’s first and largest carbon market**.
  * Works on **legally binding emission caps**, **auctioned allowances**, and **strict verification** mechanisms.
  * Current carbon price: **€60–80 per tonne**.

* **Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM):**

  * A new EU regulation effective from **2026**, imposing a **carbon levy on imports** to the EU to prevent **carbon leakage** (industries moving production to countries with weaker emission norms).
  * Importers must pay a charge based on the **carbon content** of goods unless the exporting country has **comparable carbon pricing**.
  * Aims to **equalize carbon costs** between EU producers and foreign exporters.

* **Indian Carbon Market (ICM) / Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS):**

  * Launched in **2023** under the **Energy Conservation (Amendment) Act, 2022**.
  * Still in **early stages**, focusing on **intensity-based targets** (emission reduction per unit of output) rather than **absolute caps**.
  * Current credit price: **€5–10 per tonne** — far below EU levels.

---

### 2. **The News**

* **Event:** On **September 17, 2025**, India and the **European Union (EU)** unveiled a **New Strategic EU–India Agenda**, outlining cooperation in **five key pillars**:

  1. **Prosperity and Sustainability**
  2. **Technology and Innovation**
  3. **Security and Defence**
  4. **Connectivity and Global Issues**
  5. **Enablers Across Pillars**

* **Breakthrough Clause:**
  Within the **“clean transition”** section, the EU agreed to **link India’s Carbon Market (ICM)** with the **Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)**.

  * This means **carbon prices paid by Indian firms** under ICM will be **deducted from CBAM levies** imposed at the EU border.
  * Objective: Prevent **double carbon taxation** and reward **early decarbonisation efforts** by Indian exporters.

* **Significance:**

  * This marks the **first formal recognition** of a **developing country’s carbon market** by the EU.
  * If successful, it could **shield Indian exporters** and **set a precedent** for North–South carbon cooperation.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Institutional Mechanisms**

* **Indian Framework:**

  * **Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS), 2023:**

    * Implemented by the **Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE)** under the **Ministry of Power**.
    * Involves **Energy Service Companies (ESCOs)** and **Designated Consumers** across industries.
  * **Energy Conservation (Amendment) Act, 2022:**

    * Provides legal basis for creating a **national carbon market**.
  * **Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs):**

    * India has pledged to **reduce emission intensity of GDP by 45% by 2030** (from 2005 levels) and achieve **net zero by 2070**.

* **EU Framework:**

  * **EU Emissions Trading System (ETS):**

    * Covers power, manufacturing, and aviation sectors.
  * **Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM):**

    * Applies initially to **cement, steel, aluminium, fertilisers, electricity, and hydrogen**.
    * Full financial obligations begin **January 2026**.

* **Bilateral Cooperation Platforms:**

  * **EU–India Clean Energy and Climate Partnership (2016)**
  * **EU–India Trade and Technology Council (2023)**
  * **Joint Working Group on Environment (2024)**

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### **Issues and Challenges**

1. **Underdeveloped Carbon Market in India:**

   * Lacks **absolute emission caps**, **auction mechanisms**, and **independent regulators**.
   * Current credits rely on **project-based offsets** rather than verified emission reductions.
   * EU may consider Indian credits **non-equivalent** and refuse full CBAM deductions.

2. **Carbon Price Disparity:**

   * EU carbon price ≈ €70/tonne
   * India ≈ €5–10/tonne
     → Huge price gap undermines mutual recognition of credits.

3. **Institutional Weakness:**

   * No Indian counterpart to **EU’s emissions registry** or **market integrity framework**.
   * Risk of **non-compliance, low transparency**, and **data unreliability**.

4. **Political & Legal Contradiction:**

   * India has **formally opposed CBAM** at **WTO**, terming it **“green protectionism”**.
   * Linking with CBAM may appear as **accepting** what it previously **criticized**.

5. **Sovereignty & Policy Space:**

   * CBAM effectively allows the EU to **judge India’s domestic carbon pricing**, raising **sovereignty concerns**.
   * EU rejection of Indian credits could trigger **trade or diplomatic disputes**.

6. **Domestic Political Economy:**

   * Indian industries fear a **double burden** (ICM compliance + CBAM levy).
   * May pressure the government to **dilute domestic standards**.

#### **Impacts**

* **Positive:**

  * Incentivises **industrial decarbonisation**.
  * Prevents **trade losses** due to EU’s CBAM.
  * Enhances **climate diplomacy and trust** between India and the EU.

* **Negative:**

  * Without proper alignment, could **penalise exporters** and **slow green transition**.
  * May deepen **North–South policy asymmetry** on climate justice.

#### **Ethical and Governance Concerns**

* Balancing **environmental integrity** with **economic justice** for developing economies.
* Need for **transparent carbon accounting** and **global fairness** in carbon pricing.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Strengthen India’s Carbon Market Architecture:**

   * Move from **intensity-based** to **cap-based** emissions limits.
   * Establish **independent verification authorities** and a **central carbon registry**.

3. **Institutional Collaboration:**

   * Form a **joint EU–India Carbon Cooperation Committee** to harmonize methodologies and verification.
   * Seek **EU technical assistance** for MRV (Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification) frameworks.

4. **Safeguard Sovereignty:**

   * Ensure that linkage does **not compromise India’s policy independence**.
   * Maintain **WTO-consistent** mechanisms to avoid future trade disputes.

5. **Support Exporters:**

   * Develop a **CBAM Adjustment Fund** or **rebate mechanism** to offset compliance costs for small exporters.
   * Build **capacity in green manufacturing** sectors (steel, cement, aluminium).

6. **Long-Term Strategic Vision:**

   * Use the linkage to push for **global carbon market integration** under **Article 6 of the Paris Agreement**.
   * Position India as a **leader in carbon diplomacy** among developing nations.

# Is the Dogri language losing resonance in India?
---

## **Decline of Dogri and India’s Linguistic Crisis**

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Linguistic Diversity in India:**
  India is one of the most linguistically diverse countries in the world — the 2001 Census recorded **122 major languages** and **1,599 dialects**. However, this rich heritage is shrinking rapidly.
  According to **UNESCO’s Atlas of the World’s Languages in Danger**, India tops the list of countries with the **maximum number of endangered languages**.

* **Endangered Languages:**
  A language is considered endangered when it is **no longer transmitted naturally to the next generation**. When the last speaker dies, the language becomes **extinct**.

* **Dogri Language – Overview:**

  * Belongs to the **Indo-Aryan family**.
  * Spoken primarily in the **Jammu region** of Jammu & Kashmir, and parts of **Himachal Pradesh and Punjab**.
  * **Script:** Devanagari (earlier Takri).
  * Recognised in the **Eighth Schedule of the Constitution (2003)**.
  * Declared an **official language of J&K** under the **J&K Official Languages Act, 2020**, alongside Hindi, Urdu, Kashmiri, and English.

---

### 2. **The News**

* **UNESCO Concern:**
  India has lost **over 220 languages** in the last **50 years**, indicating a severe **linguistic extinction crisis**.

* **Dogri’s Decline in Jammu:**
  Despite constitutional and official recognition, **Dogri is losing ground** due to:

  * **Globalisation and migration** — younger generations prefer Hindi or English for social mobility.
  * **Neglect in education and governance** — limited use in schools, official work, or media.
  * **Cultural apathy** — native speakers themselves prioritise dominant languages.

* **Survey Findings (Jammu Region):**

  * **Government failure:** 48% respondents feel the government hasn’t supported Dogri adequately.
  * **Economic irrelevance:** 43.2% see **no job advantage** in learning Dogri.
  * **Generational decline:**

    * Age 60+: strong speaking and moderate reading/writing skills.
    * Age 41–60: writing proficiency fell to **0.25%**.
    * Age <20: **0%** literacy in Dogri.
  * **Rural–Urban Divide:**

    * **Rural:** 56% speak, 15% write Dogri.
    * **Urban:** 45% speak, only 4% write Dogri.

* **Implication:**
  Dogri’s decline is symptomatic of a **broader cultural and policy failure** that risks erasing India’s regional linguistic identities.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Institutional Mechanisms**

* **Constitutional and Legal Support:**

  * **Article 29:** Protection of cultural and linguistic rights of minorities.
  * **Eighth Schedule (Constitution):** Dogri added in **2003**.
