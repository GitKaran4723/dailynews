# U.S. is doing a trade deal with India, says Trump
---

## **U.S.–India Trade Deal and Trump's Remarks at APEC Summit**

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Trade Deal:** A trade deal is an agreement between two or more countries to manage and promote trade relationships — usually by reducing tariffs, import restrictions, and other trade barriers.
* **Tariffs:** These are taxes imposed on imported goods. They can make imports more expensive and are often used as tools of economic policy or diplomatic pressure.
* **APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation):** A regional economic forum of 21 Pacific Rim countries that promotes free trade and economic cooperation.
* **Background Context:**

  * The U.S. and India have been negotiating a limited trade agreement for years to resolve issues related to tariffs, intellectual property, and market access.
  * Relations between the two countries have at times been tense — particularly over tariffs, data localization, and India’s purchase of Russian oil.

### 2. **The News**

* **What Happened:**
  U.S. President **Donald Trump** stated that Washington is “doing a trade deal with India” and highlighted his “great relationship” with **Prime Minister Narendra Modi**.
* **Where and When:**
  He made these remarks on **Wednesday** at the **APEC CEO Summit in Gyeongju, South Korea**, as part of his **three-nation Asian tour** (Japan, South Korea, and another yet unspecified stop).
* **Details:**

  * Trump emphasized Modi’s leadership, calling him “tough as hell” and “the nicest looking guy.”
  * He also claimed credit for mediating between **India and Pakistan**, stating he helped stop a conflict between the two nations “within 24 hours.”
  * At the same time, Trump praised **Pakistan’s Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir**, calling him “a great fighter.”
  * The comments come amid strained U.S.–India ties following Trump’s **50% tariffs on Indian goods** and **25% additional levies** over India’s **import of Russian crude oil**.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **India–U.S. Trade Relations:**

  * **Generalized System of Preferences (GSP):** The U.S. withdrew India’s GSP benefits in 2019, impacting duty-free exports from India.

# Report: Indian IT industry big contributor to business-driven air travel and carbon footprint
---

## **Sustainable Travel Policies and Aviation Emission Mitigation in India**

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Sustainable Travel:** Refers to transportation choices that reduce environmental impact, primarily greenhouse gas emissions, and promote eco-friendly mobility options.
* **Aviation and Climate Impact:**

  * Air travel is among the **most carbon-intensive modes** of transportation.
  * The aviation sector contributes around **2–3% of global CO₂ emissions**, but its overall climate impact is higher due to non-CO₂ effects at high altitudes (like contrails and nitrogen oxides).
* **Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi):**
  A global framework that helps companies set greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in line with climate science, aiming to limit global warming to well below 2°C or 1.5°C.
* **Carbon Tax:**
  A fiscal measure that imposes a fee on the carbon content of fuels, intended to encourage emission reductions.

---

### 2. **The News**

* **What Happened:**
  A report titled *“Urgency and Potential of Aviation Impact Mitigation in India”* by **cBalance.in** has urged Indian IT companies to adopt **sustainable travel policies** to cut aviation-related emissions.

* **Key Recommendations for IT Companies:**

  * Enforce travel policies such as:

    * Flying **economy class** (lower per-passenger emissions).
    * **Choosing non-stop flights**, trains, or buses for shorter routes.
    * **Capping frequent flyer trips** per employee.
  * **Align** company goals with **Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi)** recommendations.
  * Introduce **incentives** (like bonuses) for employees adhering to low-carbon travel.

* **Findings:**

  * Over 1,000 km, an air traveller emits **285 kg of CO₂**, compared to **30 kg** for trains and **70 kg** for AC buses.
  * Out of eight major IT companies assessed (2019–2024), **five** were found **lagging in meeting their carbon reduction goals**.

* **Recommendations for Policymakers:**

  * **Cap aviation emissions** and **levy carbon taxes** on air travel.

# An amended Constitution Bill, its contentious issues
---

## **Constitution (One Hundred and Thirtieth Amendment) Bill, 2025: Removal of Ministers in Custody**

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Constitutional Context:**
  The Indian Constitution (Articles 75, 164, and 239AA) governs the **Union Council of Ministers**, **State Council of Ministers**, and **Delhi’s special administration**, respectively.

  * **Article 75**: Deals with the appointment, tenure, and responsibilities of Union Ministers.
  * **Article 164**: Deals with the State Ministers under the Governor.
  * **Article 239AA**: Governs the administration of the National Capital Territory (Delhi).

* **Purpose of the Amendment:**
  The **Constitution (130th Amendment) Bill, 2025** seeks to introduce **a mechanism for automatic removal or resignation of Ministers** (including the Prime Minister and Chief Ministers) if they remain in custody for **30 consecutive days** after arrest for an offence punishable with imprisonment of **five years or more**.

* **Rationale Claimed by the Government:**
  To uphold **constitutional morality**, ensure **ethical governance**, and prevent **tainted individuals** from holding ministerial office while under criminal investigation.

---

### 2. **The News**

* **What Happened:**
  The **Central Government** introduced the **Constitution (One Hundred and Thirtieth Amendment) Bill, 2025** in Parliament. It proposes amendments to **Articles 75, 164, and 239AA**.

* **Provisions of the Bill:**

  1. If a Minister is **arrested and detained for 30 consecutive days** for an alleged offence punishable with **five years or more**, the following applies:

     * **Union Level:** The President shall remove the Minister on the advice of the Prime Minister (to be tendered by the 31st day).
     * **State Level:** The Governor shall remove the Minister on the advice of the Chief Minister.
     * **Prime Minister/Chief Minister:** Must resign by the 31st day or **automatically cease** to hold office.

* **Current Status:**
  The Bill has been **referred to a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC)** for detailed scrutiny.

* **Opposition’s Contention:**
  Opposition parties raised concerns about **misuse of the “arrest” and “detention” parameters**, arguing that both are **subject to executive discretion** and **vulnerable to political misuse**.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Legal Background**

#### a. **Existing Legal Safeguards and Precedents**

* **Discretionary Nature of Arrest:**

  * *Deenan vs Jayalalithaa (1989)*: The Madras High Court held that arrest under Section 41 CrPC (“may arrest”) is discretionary, not mandatory.
  * *Joginder Kumar vs State of U.P. (1994)*: Supreme Court ruled that arrest should not be mechanical; reasons must justify it.
  * *Arnesh Kumar vs State of Bihar (2014)*: Directed police to record reasons before arrest; most arrests were deemed unnecessary (National Police Commission, 1977).

* **Sections of Law (CrPC / BNSS):**

  * *Section 41 CrPC (now Section 35 BNSS)* — Power to arrest without warrant.
  * *Section 41A CrPC (now Section 35 BNSS)* — Notice of appearance if arrest not necessary.
  * *Section 167(2) CrPC (now Section 187 BNSS)* — **Default bail** if investigation not completed within 60–90 days.

#### b. **Relevance of Special Laws:**

* **PMLA (Prevention of Money Laundering Act)**
* **UAPA (Unlawful Activities Prevention Act)**
* **NDPS Act (Narcotics)**
  These laws include **“twin bail conditions”**, making bail extremely difficult and reversing the burden of proof — as seen in the **Manish Sisodia liquor policy case**, where bail came after **17 months**.

#### c. **Judicial Observations:**

Courts have consistently emphasised that **bail is the rule, jail is the exception** (Joginder Kumar, Satender Kumar Antil cases). However, practical realities show that prolonged detentions often occur due to strict bail conditions and judicial discretion.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### **a. Issues and Challenges**

1. **Misuse of Arrest Powers:**

   * Arrest decisions can be politically motivated, especially against opposition leaders.
   * Police discretion under “may arrest” clauses makes uniform enforcement difficult.

2. **Violation of Constitutional Principles:**

   * Could undermine **Article 14 (equality before law)** and **Article 21 (right to personal liberty)** due to arbitrary removal.
   * Risks political manipulation of executive power.

3. **Conflict with “Presumption of Innocence”:**

   * The amendment effectively **punishes a person before conviction**, contradicting criminal jurisprudence.

4. **Lack of Consideration for Default Bail:**

   * Since remand periods can exceed 30 days, many accused could automatically lose their ministerial positions before charges are proven.

5. **Impact of Special Laws:**

   * Under stringent Acts like PMLA or UAPA, securing bail within 30 days is almost impossible — leading to disproportionate consequences.

6. **Institutional Integrity:**

   * While intended to promote ethics, it could be weaponised to destabilise elected governments through selective arrests.

#### **b. Impacts**

* **Political:** Heightened confrontation between ruling and opposition parties.
* **Legal:** Potential challenges in the Supreme Court for violating basic structure (rule of law and separation of powers).
* **Governance:** Risk of administrative instability due to frequent ministerial removals.
* **Public Morality:** Positive signal against corruption, but needs procedural safeguards to avoid misuse.

#### **c. Ethical Dimension**

* **Pro:** Promotes *integrity in public office* and aligns with the idea of *clean politics*.
* **Con:** If misused, it violates *natural justice* and could erode public faith in constitutional fairness.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Ensure Judicial Oversight:**

   * Removal of Ministers should occur only **after judicial confirmation of charges**, not merely arrest or remand.

2. **Define Safeguards Clearly:**

   * Specify that only arrests **sanctioned by a competent court** trigger removal provisions.
   * Exempt cases where **default bail** applies.

3. **Independent Review Mechanism:**

   * Establish a **constitutional panel** (akin to the Election Commission model) to recommend suspension/removal to prevent political misuse.

4. **Strengthen Criminal Justice Reforms:**

   * Implement the directions of *Arnesh Kumar* and *Satender Kumar Antil* cases to curb arbitrary arrests.

5. **Separate Ethics Code for Ministers:**

   * Introduce a **Ministerial Code of Conduct** (similar to UK’s model) mandating temporary suspension pending judicial clearance.

6. **Parliamentary Oversight:**

   * Empower the **Joint Parliamentary Committee** to define procedural clarity and periodic review of implementation.

# ​Federalism and funds
---

## **Kerala’s Pause on PM SHRI Scheme and the Federalism Debate**

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **PM SHRI (Prime Minister Schools for Rising India):**
  Launched in **2022**, the PM SHRI scheme aims to **upgrade 14,500 schools across India** into **model schools** aligned with the **National Education Policy (NEP) 2020**.
  These schools are intended to showcase NEP-aligned reforms — including **competency-based learning**, **integrated assessment systems**, and **digital learning infrastructure**.

* **NEP 2020:**
  India’s first comprehensive education policy in three decades, focusing on **foundational literacy**, **flexible curricular structures (5+3+3+4 model)**, **vocational integration**, and **multilingual education**.
  Critics, however, claim it **centralises control** over education — a subject on the **Concurrent List**, thus shared between Centre and States — and **promotes ideological content** through the inclusion of “Indian Knowledge Systems.”

* **Samagra Shiksha (SS):**
  A flagship **centrally sponsored scheme** integrating the **Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan**, **Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan**, and **Teacher Education** programmes to promote holistic education.

---

### 2. **The News**

* **What Happened:**
  Kerala, long a **critic of NEP 2020**, unexpectedly signed the **PM SHRI Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)** with the **Central Government**, joining the scheme to upgrade select schools.

* **Political Fallout:**

  * The **Left Democratic Front (LDF)** government faced internal strife after signing the MoU **without Cabinet approval**.
  * The **Communist Party of India (CPI)** demanded the immediate withdrawal, calling it a **compromise of federal principles**.
  * The **CPI(M)**, managing the education portfolio, justified the move as necessary to **access withheld Samagra Shiksha funds**, which led to **teacher salary arrears**.
  * Following protests, both parties agreed to **freeze implementation** until a **Cabinet subcommittee reviews the MoU**.

* **Current Status:**

  * The **Centre has been informed** that Kerala’s participation is **on hold** pending the subcommittee’s recommendation.
  * Kerala maintains its **opposition to NEP 2020** and insists on **retaining control over its curriculum**.

* **Broader Context:**

  * **Tamil Nadu** has already **challenged the Centre in the Supreme Court**, alleging coercion after the Union withheld **Samagra Shiksha funds** for not adopting the PM SHRI–NEP framework.
  * **West Bengal** also continues to oppose NEP implementation.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **PM SHRI Scheme (2022):**

  * Aims to **transform schools** into “exemplary institutions” implementing NEP-2020.
  * Fund-sharing ratio: **60:40** between Centre and States (90:10 for NE/UTs).
  * Schools to serve as **demonstration models** for NEP implementation.

* **NEP 2020 Key Provisions Related to School Education:**

  * Emphasis on **Early Childhood Care & Education (ECCE)**.
  * **Mother tongue** as medium of instruction till Grade 5.
  * **Holistic report cards**, **vocational integration**, and **flexible curricula**.
  * Inclusion of **Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS)** — traditional sciences, arts, and philosophies — in the syllabus.

* **Federal Financial Mechanisms:**

  * **Samagra Shiksha**: A key scheme requiring alignment with national education goals for fund disbursal.
  * **Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS):** Allow the Centre to fund States for specific objectives, but often criticized for **conditional fund transfers** that infringe on State autonomy.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### **a. Issues and Challenges**

1. **Federalism and Autonomy:**

   * Education is on the **Concurrent List (Entry 25, List III)**, but NEP-linked schemes **expand central influence**.
   * Withholding Samagra Shiksha funds creates **fiscal coercion**, violating the principle of **cooperative federalism**.

2. **Political and Constitutional Concerns:**

   * Signing the MoU **without Cabinet approval** undermines **collective responsibility** under **Article 163**.
   * **Ideological apprehensions** over “Indian Knowledge Systems” seen as **anti-scientific or communal**.

3. **Administrative Redundancy:**

   * Kerala’s education system already exceeds NEP targets — **high literacy (96%)**, **low dropout rates**, **modern infrastructure** — making PM SHRI appear **cosmetic**.

4. **Judicial Dimension:**

   * The Tamil Nadu petition in the Supreme Court raises crucial questions about **Centre–State financial relations** and **judicial protection of federal principles**.

#### **b. Impacts**

* **On Federal Relations:** Risks **centralisation** of education policy and fiscal control.
* **On Education Policy:** Potential dilution of **State-specific innovations** like Kerala’s public-school modernisation and IT-enabled classrooms.
* **On Governance:** Could set a precedent where **fund access is tied to ideological compliance**.
* **On Political Stability:** Strains within coalitions and between State and Centre over shared powers.

#### **c. Ethical and Governance Dimensions**

* Raises issues of **coercive conditionality** — using financial leverage to influence State policy.
* Tests **constitutional morality**, **democratic decision-making**, and **collective accountability**.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Strengthen Cooperative Federalism:**

   * The Centre should ensure **consensus-based implementation** of NEP provisions through the **Inter-State Council or NITI Aayog**.

2. **Judicial Clarity:**

   * The Supreme Court should expeditiously hear the **Tamil Nadu case** to establish constitutional limits on **conditional funding**.

3. **Transparent Fiscal Transfers:**

   * Centrally Sponsored Schemes should not penalise States for exercising **policy autonomy**.
   * Introduce a **Uniform Funding Framework** separating **educational grants** from **policy adoption**.

4. **State-Level Customisation:**

   * Allow States to **adapt NEP objectives** within their educational frameworks.
   * Kerala’s model — with decentralised governance and community participation — can guide national standards.

5. **Institutional Mechanism:**

   * Create a **National–State Education Coordination Council** to mediate Centre–State differences.

6. **Ethical Governance:**

   * Ensure **policy decisions (like MoUs)** are approved through **democratic cabinet procedures** to maintain transparency.

# Developing nations need 12 times more funds to fight climate crisis
---

## **UN Report Highlights Climate Finance Gap Ahead of COP-30**

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Climate Finance:**
  Refers to **financial resources provided by developed countries to developing nations** to help them mitigate (reduce emissions) and adapt (cope with impacts) to climate change.
  It includes funds for renewable energy, disaster resilience, agriculture, water management, and loss & damage compensation.

* **Adaptation vs Mitigation:**

  * **Adaptation:** Adjusting systems and infrastructure to minimize harm from climate impacts (e.g., flood barriers, drought-resistant crops).
  * **Mitigation:** Reducing greenhouse gas emissions to limit future warming (e.g., switching to renewable energy).

* **UNFCCC and COP:**
  The **UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)** governs global climate negotiations.
  Its annual **Conference of Parties (COP)** brings together countries to assess progress and set new goals — **COP-30** will be held in **Belém, Brazil (2025)**.

* **New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG):**
  A **post-2025 climate finance framework**, replacing the earlier $100 billion annual goal set at COP15 (Copenhagen, 2009). It is meant to determine how much funding developed nations will provide each year to developing countries.

---

### 2. **The News**

* **What Happened:**
  The **United Nations’ annual report, “Running on Empty” (2025)**, released ahead of **COP-30**, warns of a **massive shortfall in climate adaptation finance** for developing nations.

* **Key Findings:**

  * Developing countries will need **$310–365 billion (₹27 lakh crore)** *annually by 2035* to adapt to climate change.
  * Current adaptation finance is only **$26 billion (₹2.2 lakh crore)** — **12 times less** than what is needed.
  * Adaptation finance **declined** from **$28 billion in 2022** to **$26 billion in 2023**.
  * The **COP-26 (Glasgow)** goal to **double adaptation finance to $40 billion by 2025** is *unlikely to be achieved*.

* **At COP-29 (Baku, 2024):**

  * Developing countries demanded **$1.3 trillion annually by 2035**.
  * Developed countries offered only **$300 billion** — finalized as the **NCQG (New Collective Quantified Goal)**.
  * This gap remains one of the **biggest sticking points in climate negotiations**.

* **Debt Concerns:**

  * 70% of adaptation finance in 2022–23 was “concessional” (low-interest), but **58% of it came as loans**, not grants.
  * The UN warns that **climate finance turning into debt** burdens vulnerable nations already struggling with poverty and disasters.

# What is China’s complaint against India at WTO?
---

## **China’s WTO Complaint Against India’s PLI Scheme**

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme:**

  * Launched in **2020**, the PLI scheme is India’s flagship industrial policy initiative designed to **boost domestic manufacturing** and **reduce import dependence**.
  * It offers **financial incentives** to companies based on **incremental sales and value addition**, encouraging them to produce in India and integrate with **global value chains**.
  * Objectives:

    * Promote **Make in India**.
    * Create **jobs** and boost exports.
    * Attract **global investment** in sunrise sectors such as electronics, batteries, automotive, and pharmaceuticals.

* **Relevant PLI Schemes Challenged by China:**

  1. **PLI for Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) Batteries:**
     Incentivizes giga-scale battery manufacturing to support the EV ecosystem.

     * Requires **25% Domestic Value Addition (DVA)**.
  2. **PLI for Auto Sector:**
     Promotes manufacturing of **Advanced Automotive Technology (AAT)** vehicles and components.

     * Requires **50% DVA**.
  3. **PLI for Electric Vehicles (EVs):**
     Seeks to attract **global EV manufacturers** to produce in India.

* **WTO and Subsidy Regulation:**

  * The **World Trade Organization (WTO)** governs trade between nations, ensuring non-discriminatory practices.
  * The **Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM)** regulates industrial subsidies to prevent unfair trade advantages.

---

### 2. **The News**

* **What Happened:**
  China has **filed a complaint with the WTO** against India, alleging that certain **PLI schemes violate international trade rules** by providing **prohibited import substitution subsidies**.

* **China’s Allegations:**

  * India’s PLI schemes **discriminate against foreign products**, particularly **Chinese goods**, by mandating **Domestic Value Addition (DVA)** for eligibility.
  * The schemes, according to China, **incentivize the use of domestic goods** over imported goods — a form of **Import Substitution (IS) subsidy** prohibited under WTO law.

* **India’s Likely Defense:**

  * The **PLI scheme’s DVA requirement** is **not a local content requirement** but a **performance-based metric**.
  * Value addition can occur through **domestic processing, design, or technology transfer**, not necessarily through local material use.
  * Thus, **PLI incentives do not explicitly discriminate** against foreign goods.

* **Next Steps:**

  1. **Consultations:** Both nations will first engage in consultations under WTO rules.
  2. **Panel Adjudication:** If unresolved, a **WTO Dispute Settlement Panel** may be formed.
  3. **Appeal Stalemate:** Since the **Appellate Body is non-functional** (since 2019), any appeal could indefinitely delay the dispute’s resolution — effectively preserving the **status quo**.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **PLI Scheme Overview (2020–present):**

  * Covers **14 key sectors**, including:

    * Electronics, pharmaceuticals, automobiles, batteries, textiles, solar PV, and semiconductors.

* **Strategic Intent:**

  * Reduce dependence on **Chinese imports** in critical technologies (e.g., EV batteries, electronics).
  * Promote **supply chain diversification** post-COVID and geopolitical tensions.

* **WTO Compatibility Measures:**

  * India maintains that its industrial policies **do not violate SCM or TRIMs obligations**, as **no mandatory local content** clauses are included.
  * India has historically faced **WTO disputes** over solar power programs and **local content requirements**, which it lost — shaping how newer policies like PLI are worded carefully.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### **a. Issues and Challenges**

1. **Trade Law Concerns:**

   * PLI’s DVA clause could be interpreted as an **import substitution subsidy**, violating **Article 3.1(b)** of the SCM Agreement.
   * Might also breach **Article III.4 of GATT (National Treatment)** and **Article 2.1 of TRIMs** (prohibition on local content-based incentives).

2. **Strategic Rivalry:**

   * China’s complaint reflects **growing trade tensions** in high-tech sectors such as EVs, semiconductors, and renewable energy.

3. **Global Value Chains (GVCs):**

   * India’s industrial policy faces the challenge of attracting global investment **without breaching WTO rules**.

4. **WTO Paralysis:**

   * With the **Appellate Body defunct**, dispute resolution is **effectively stalled**, undermining trust in multilateral trade governance.

5. **Domestic Pressure:**

   * India must balance **industrial self-reliance** with **global compliance**, ensuring policies like PLI are WTO-consistent.

#### **b. Impacts**

* **Economic:**

  * May affect India’s export credibility and investor confidence if found non-compliant.
  * However, prolonged WTO proceedings allow India to **retain current policy momentum**.

* **Political:**

  * Reflects **Sino-Indian strategic competition** extending into trade and technology.
  * India may garner support from **developing countries** defending their **industrial policy space**.

* **Legal:**

  * Could set a precedent for evaluating **industrial incentive schemes** in the developing world.

#### **c. Ethical and Governance Dimensions**

* Balancing **national development goals** with **international trade fairness**.
* Raises ethical questions on **sovereignty in industrial policy** vs **global trade obligations**.
* Calls for reform in the WTO system to **accommodate developing nations’ growth imperatives**.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Legal Defense and Diplomacy:**

   * India should emphasize that **PLI’s DVA metric ≠ local content requirement**, hence not a **prohibited subsidy**.
   * Strengthen diplomatic engagement to resolve the dispute at the **consultation stage**.

2. **Policy Refinement:**

   * Revisit PLI design to explicitly clarify that incentives are **based on performance**, not **origin of inputs**.
   * Maintain transparency to avoid ambiguity in WTO compliance.

3. **Multilateral Reform:**

   * India and other developing nations must push for **WTO reforms** to protect **policy space for industrial growth**.

4. **Diversify Supply Chains:**

   * Continue efforts to **reduce overdependence on Chinese imports** by fostering **domestic ecosystems** in EVs and batteries.

5. **Build Legal and Trade Capacity:**

   * Invest in **trade law expertise** to defend India’s industrial policies at international forums.

6. **Strategic Communication:**

   * Publicly highlight the **developmental rationale** of PLI — not protectionism, but industrial transformation.

# How do cyclones form and how are they measured?
---

## **Understanding Tropical Cyclones: The World’s Most Powerful Weather Systems**

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Cyclones Defined:**
  A **tropical cyclone** is a **rotating, organized system of clouds and thunderstorms** that originates over warm tropical oceans. It has a **low-pressure centre** and produces **strong winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges**.

  * Known as **hurricanes** in the Atlantic and eastern Pacific.
  * Known as **typhoons** in the western Pacific.
  * Known simply as **cyclones** in the Indian Ocean and South Pacific.

* **Cyclone as a “Heat Engine”:**
  The cyclone functions like a **natural engine**, drawing **latent heat energy** from warm ocean waters (temperature >26.5°C) and converting it into **kinetic energy** (winds and convection).

* **Key Features:**

  * **Eye:** Calm, low-pressure centre.
  * **Eyewall:** Surrounds the eye, where the strongest winds and heaviest rain occur.
  * **Spiral Rainbands:** Bands of clouds spiralling outward that bring intense rainfall.

---

### 2. **The News / Explanation**

* **Formation Process:**

  1. Begins as a **low-pressure area** associated with thunderstorms over warm seas.
  2. **Warm, moist air rises** and cools, releasing **latent heat**, which fuels further uplift and condensation.
  3. Rising air lowers surface pressure, drawing in more air — a **self-sustaining cycle** of convection begins.
  4. The **Coriolis force** (due to Earth’s rotation) imparts a **spin**, causing counterclockwise rotation in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere.
  5. **Low wind shear** is crucial — strong upper-level winds can disrupt the cyclone’s organization.
  6. Once organized, a **central eye and eyewall** form, marking a mature cyclone.

* **Favourable Conditions for Cyclone Formation:**

  * Sea surface temperature > 26.5°C up to a depth of 50 m.
  * Unstable atmosphere (warm air rising freely).
  * Sufficient Coriolis force (thus, cyclones don’t form near the equator).
  * Low vertical wind shear.
  * High humidity in the mid-troposphere.
