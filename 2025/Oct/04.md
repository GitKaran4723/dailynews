## India and Stablecoins: Signals of a Shift in Cryptocurrency Policy

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Cryptocurrency:**

  * A **digital or virtual currency** based on blockchain technology that allows peer-to-peer transactions without centralised intermediaries such as banks.
  * Popular examples: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple.

* **Stablecoins:**

  * A **subclass of cryptocurrencies** designed to maintain a stable value by pegging themselves to a **reserve asset** such as:

    * Fiat currency (e.g., USD, INR)
    * Commodities (e.g., gold)
    * A basket of assets.
  * Aim: to reduce volatility that plagues traditional cryptocurrencies.
  * Example: Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC).

* **Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC):**

  * A **sovereign digital currency** issued and backed by a country’s central bank.
  * It has **legal tender status**, unlike private cryptocurrencies.
  * India’s CBDC is called the **Digital Rupee**, being piloted by the **Reserve Bank of India (RBI)** in wholesale and retail formats.

* **Key Distinction:**

  * **Stablecoins:** Private, pegged to assets, regulated variably across countries.
  * **CBDCs:** Public, government-backed, part of the formal monetary system.

---

### 2. **The News**

* **Event:**
  At the **Kautilya Economic Conclave**, Finance Minister **Nirmala Sitharaman** indicated that India may **revisit its stance on stablecoins**, suggesting the country “must prepare to engage” with them.

* **Core Message:**

  * “Innovations like stablecoins are transforming the landscape of money and capital flows.”
  * “Nations must adapt to new monetary architectures or risk exclusion.”
  * The statement signals **India’s openness to dialogue** on stablecoins, contrasting earlier hardline positions.

* **Context:**

  * India currently **taxes but does not regulate** private cryptocurrencies.
  * The **RBI opposes** private cryptocurrencies, citing financial stability risks and potential misuse in illicit activities.
  * Simultaneously, RBI is **testing its CBDC**, marking a cautious yet progressive digital currency policy.

* **Geopolitical Angle:**

  * The Finance Minister noted that “wars and strategic rivalries are redrawing boundaries of cooperation and conflict,” implying that **financial sovereignty and digital currency systems** are becoming new instruments of geopolitical power.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Institutional Framework**

#### **A. Existing Regulatory Landscape:**

1. **Taxation Framework (Budget 2022):**

   * 30% tax on income from transfer of virtual digital assets (VDAs).
   * 1% TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) on transactions above ₹10,000.
   * No deductions allowed for losses or expenses (except cost of acquisition).

2. **Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA):**

   * Regulates cross-border movement of crypto assets, though not yet directly adapted to stablecoins.

3. **Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2023 Amendment:**

   * Brought **Virtual Digital Asset service providers** under AML obligations — KYC, record-keeping, and suspicious transaction reporting.

4. **Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC):**

   * RBI’s **Digital Rupee pilots** are ongoing in 13 cities with over 20 banks participating.
   * Objectives: reduce cash usage, improve payment efficiency, and ensure monetary sovereignty.

#### **B. Future Policy Signals:**

* The Finance Ministry’s latest remarks may indicate:

  1. **Potential Regulatory Framework** for stablecoins (rather than outright prohibition).
  2. **Exploration of asset-backed digital instruments** for cross-border payments and remittances.
  3. Alignment with **global standards** being developed by the **IMF**, **Financial Stability Board (FSB)**, and **G20**.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### **Issues and Challenges:**

1. **Financial Stability Risks:**

   * Large-scale stablecoin adoption could undermine monetary control and banking liquidity.
2. **Consumer Protection:**

   * Absence of regulation may expose investors to fraud and volatility.
3. **Monetary Sovereignty:**

   * Privately issued currencies challenge a nation’s monetary authority.
4. **Technological Infrastructure:**

   * Need for robust cybersecurity, blockchain regulation, and interoperability frameworks.
5. **Regulatory Ambiguity:**

   * Lack of a clear legal definition of crypto assets delays investor confidence and innovation.

#### **Impacts:**

* **Economic:**

  * Could revolutionise payments, cross-border remittances, and trade finance.
  * Stablecoins offer low-cost, real-time settlement options for international transactions.
* **Monetary:**

  * Risks parallel monetary systems competing with official currency.
* **Technological:**

  * Boosts India’s fintech and blockchain ecosystem if regulated smartly.
* **Geopolitical:**

  * Enables India to assert leadership in global **digital finance governance** under G20 presidency legacy.

#### **Ethical and Governance Concerns:**

* Balancing **innovation vs. regulation**.
* Ensuring **data privacy**, **financial inclusion**, and **anti-money laundering (AML)** safeguards.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Develop a Dedicated Crypto-Assets Regulation Framework:**

   * Create a unified **Virtual Digital Asset Regulation Act (VDARA)** defining stablecoins, exchanges, and permissible uses.
   * Integrate **RBI, SEBI, and Finance Ministry** oversight under a common board.

2. **Regulate, Not Ban:**

   * Learn from **Japan, Singapore, and the EU (MiCA Regulation)** where stablecoins operate within transparent regulatory boundaries.
   * Licensing regime for **Stablecoin issuers** ensuring asset backing and full disclosure.

3. **Synergise Stablecoins and CBDC:**

   * Permit **RBI-approved rupee-backed stablecoins** to complement CBDC for private and cross-border use cases.
   * Foster interoperability between **CBDC systems and private digital wallets**.

4. **Global Cooperation:**

   * Engage in **IMF–FSB–G20 frameworks** for uniform global norms on stablecoins.
   * Strengthen **AML/KYC compliance** under international FATF standards.

5. **Consumer and Investor Awareness:**

   * Nationwide digital financial literacy campaigns to mitigate risks from speculative trading.

6. **Encourage Fintech Innovation:**

   * Promote **regulatory sandboxes** for blockchain-based payment systems.
   * Incentivise start-ups developing **stablecoin auditing, blockchain security, and digital ID integration**.

---

###  **Conclusion**

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s remarks mark a **strategic inflection point** in India’s approach to digital finance. From resistance to readiness, India may soon move toward a **regulated engagement model** with stablecoins — balancing innovation with sovereignty.

While the **RBI’s CBDC** remains the official backbone of digital currency policy, **private stablecoins** could complement India’s evolving financial ecosystem by enhancing global competitiveness and payment efficiency.

India’s challenge — and opportunity — lies in crafting a **regulatory architecture** that encourages innovation while safeguarding monetary stability, ensuring that the digital future of money aligns with the **Atmanirbhar Bharat** vision of self-reliant, inclusive growth.

# Peace mirage

## Trump’s 20-Point Gaza “Peace Plan”: Promise or Political Posturing?

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **The Gaza Conflict in Context:**

  * The **Israel–Palestine conflict** has persisted for over seven decades, driven by disputes over land, sovereignty, and national identity.
  * **Gaza Strip:** A 365 sq. km enclave governed by **Hamas** since 2007, blockaded by Israel and Egypt.
  * The **October 7, 2023 Hamas attack** on Israel — killing over 1,200 people — triggered Israel’s massive military response.
  * Two years later, Gaza is **largely destroyed**, with its entire population displaced and thousands dead.

* **Donald Trump’s Role:**

  * Former U.S. President **Donald Trump**, now positioning himself as a global statesman, unveiled a **20-point “Peace Plan for Gaza.”**
  * The plan has been **welcomed by Israel and key Arab states** but **excluded Palestinian representation**.

* **Core Idea:**
  The plan seeks to **impose stability** through foreign control and international supervision rather than a negotiated settlement, risking perpetuation of conflict rather than peace.

---

### 2. **The News**

* **Approval and Endorsement:**

  * The plan won support from **Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu**, who said it aligns with Israel’s **war aims** of defeating Hamas and ensuring Israeli security.
  * Some **Arab and Muslim nations**, under Western diplomatic persuasion, have cautiously welcomed it as a “first step” toward peace.

* **Palestinian Exclusion:**

  * No Palestinian — neither from **Hamas** nor the **Palestinian Authority (PA)** — was consulted or included.
  * The absence of the **Palestinian voice** undermines legitimacy and recalls the failures of previous unilateral peace initiatives.

* **Key Provisions of the 20-Point Plan:**

  1. **Ceasefire** tied to the **release of hostages** held by Hamas.
  2. **No forced displacement** of Palestinians from Gaza.
  3. Creation of an **international governing body**, the *“Board of Peace”*, **chaired by Donald Trump** himself.
  4. Deployment of an **International Stabilisation Force (ISF)** to manage Gaza’s security.
  5. **Israel retains a “security perimeter”** around Gaza and authority over air and maritime access.
  6. **Hamas must fully demobilise** and disarm.
  7. **Palestinians excluded from governance** until the *Palestinian Authority is “reformed.”*

* **Criticisms:**

  * The plan **legitimises Israeli occupation**, **internationalises control**, and **removes Palestinian agency**.
  * It **lacks timelines, implementation clarity, or accountability mechanisms.**
  * By conditioning peace on Hamas’s surrender, it risks perpetuating war.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Global Context**

#### **A. International Background:**

1. **Israel’s Objectives:**

   * Destroy Hamas, prevent its resurgence, and maintain long-term security control over Gaza.
2. **Arab States’ Calculations:**

   * Countries like **Saudi Arabia, UAE, Egypt, and Jordan** seek regional stability but face domestic pressure to support Palestinians.
   * Support for Trump’s plan is **pragmatic**, not ideological — aimed at curbing chaos near their borders.
3. **United States’ Motives:**

   * Trump aims to **reassert U.S. influence** in West Asia and revive his image as a dealmaker, following his 2020 **Abraham Accords** initiative.

#### **B. Relevant Frameworks and Precedents:**

* **Oslo Accords (1993-95):** Created limited Palestinian self-rule under the Palestinian Authority — now largely defunct.
* **UN Resolutions 242 & 338:** Call for withdrawal from occupied territories and a negotiated peace.
* **Abraham Accords (2020):** Normalisation of relations between Israel and several Arab states — sidelining the Palestinian cause.
* **UNRWA (United Nations Relief and Works Agency):** Still the main provider of humanitarian aid to displaced Palestinians.

#### **C. India’s Position:**

* Consistent support for a **two-state solution** — Israel and a sovereign **Palestinian state** with **East Jerusalem as its capital**.
* Calls for **immediate humanitarian access**, **ceasefire**, and **respect for international law**.
* Balances ties with Israel (defence & tech) and Arab world (energy & diaspora interests).

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### **Issues and Challenges:**

* **Exclusion of Palestinians:**

  * No legitimate peace process can ignore the principal victims and stakeholders.
* **Colonial Overtones:**

  * “International governance” resembles trusteeship — reviving memories of **post-WWI mandates** over Arab lands.
* **Security without Sovereignty:**

  * Israel’s control over borders and airspace negates any notion of Palestinian autonomy.
* **Humanitarian Crisis:**

  * Gaza’s near-total destruction has created **one of the world’s largest refugee crises**.
* **Geopolitical Instrumentalisation:**

  * The plan strengthens **U.S.–Israel axis**, marginalises the UN, and bypasses multilateral diplomacy.

#### **Impacts:**

* **Regional:**

  * May stabilise borders temporarily but fuel resentment across Arab societies.
* **Political:**

  * Undermines Palestinian Authority’s legitimacy; risks creating leadership vacuums exploited by militant groups.
* **Ethical:**

  * Disregards justice, accountability, and self-determination — principles central to any genuine peace.
* **Global:**

  * Sets a precedent of **power-brokered peace without consent**, weakening international law.

#### **UPSC Linkages:**

* *GS Paper II:* International Relations – West Asia politics, role of U.S., Israel–Palestine conflict.
* *GS Paper III:* Security & international order; geopolitics of peacekeeping.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Re-centre Palestinian Agency:**

   * Any peace process must include **legitimate Palestinian representatives** from both Fatah and reformed civil society leadership.

2. **Two-State Solution Revival:**

   * Reinforce **UN-led multilateral diplomacy** toward the long-stalled two-state framework.

3. **Immediate Humanitarian Priorities:**

   * Ensure **ceasefire**, **access to aid**, and **reconstruction guarantees** through neutral international oversight.

4. **International Accountability:**

   * Establish a **UN Commission** to investigate **war crimes**, **civilian targeting**, and **illegal occupation practices**.

5. **Regional Mediation Mechanisms:**

   * Empower **Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia** to act as guarantors of a balanced settlement.

6. **India’s Role:**

   * Promote **inclusive peace dialogue**, contribute to **humanitarian aid**, and leverage its balanced ties to facilitate UN initiatives.

---

### 🕊️ **Conclusion**

Donald Trump’s 20-point Gaza plan, despite its diplomatic gloss, reflects **a peace without Palestinians**, a **solution without sovereignty**, and a **ceasefire without justice**.
While its rhetoric promises stability, its architecture entrenches Israeli control and marginalises Palestinian aspirations.

True peace in West Asia will emerge not from imposed frameworks but from **inclusive negotiation**, **mutual recognition**, and a **credible roadmap to Palestinian statehood**.

Until the **Palestinian voice** returns to the table, every “peace plan” will remain, as the article aptly puts it, **“written in sand.”**

* Of this, **green bonds** made up **83%** of the total.
* Despite a robust trajectory — with green bond investment crossing **$45 billion in 2025** — the gap between needs and actual flow remains vast.
* Private sector participation is strong (**84% of green bond issuance**), but **small and medium enterprises (SMEs)** and **local innovators** remain underfinanced.

---

### 3. **Institutional and Policy Frameworks in Play**

#### **A. Domestic Initiatives**

1. **Sovereign Green Bonds (2023 onwards):**

   * Issued by the Government of India to fund public green infrastructure projects.
2. **SEBI’s Social and Green Bond Regulations:**

---

### 5. **Strategic Shifts Needed**

#### **A. Strengthen Public Finance Leverage**

* Use **Budgetary allocations and fiscal tools** to attract private capital.
* Expand **viability gap funding (VGF)** and **blended finance** models for green infrastructure.

#### **B. Scale Blended and Concessional Finance**

* Instruments such as **partial credit guarantees**, **subordinated debt**, and **first-loss capital** can de-risk investments.
* Encourage **performance guarantees** for clean projects in **Tier-II and Tier-III cities**, where investor confidence is low.

#### **C. Mobilise Domestic Institutional Capital**

* Unlock long-term funds from **EPFO**, **LIC**, and **sovereign wealth funds** by:

  * Updating **ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance)** investment norms.
  * Establishing **green investment pipelines** with predictable returns.

#### **D. Innovate through Carbon Markets**

* India’s **Carbon Credit Trading Scheme** could become a major source of capital if:

  * Transparent monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) systems are ensured.
  * Market participation is broadened beyond corporates to include MSMEs and cooperatives.

#### **E. Leverage Technology for Climate Finance Governance**

* Use **Blockchain** for real-time tracking of climate finance flows.
* Deploy **AI-driven risk analytics** for assessing and pricing green investments.

#### **F. Prioritise Adaptation and Resilience Finance**

---

### 7. **Mains Relevance**

#### **GS Paper II – Governance & International Relations**

* India’s leadership in **ISA, CDRI, COP processes**, and **climate diplomacy**.
* Role of **global partnerships and G20** in sustainable finance mobilisation.

#### **GS Paper III – Economy & Environment**

* **Infrastructure finance**, **energy transition**, **green bonds**, and **climate technology innovation**.
* Interlinkages between **economic growth**, **clean energy**, and **employment generation**.

---

### 🌱 **Conclusion**

India’s clean energy transition is no longer a question of *technology* — it is a question of *finance*.
While policy, technology, and capacity have advanced rapidly, **capital mobilisation remains the weakest link**.

By reforming financial institutions, expanding blended finance, leveraging carbon markets, and ensuring inclusion of smaller enterprises, India can bridge the **climate finance gap** and lead not just in **energy generation**, but also in **climate finance innovation**.

Ultimately, achieving **Atmanirbhar Bharat in energy** will depend not just on generating megawatts — but on generating **trust, transparency, and transformative finance**.
