### 1. **Basic Understanding**

**What is FDI?**
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) refers to long-term investment by a foreign entity in a country’s productive assets (factories, companies, infrastructure), usually with management control.

**Net FDI vs Gross FDI**

* **Gross FDI inflows**: Total foreign investment coming into India.
* **FDI outflows**: Indian companies investing abroad + repatriation.
* **Net FDI** = Inflows − Outflows
  👉 If negative, more money is leaving than entering.

**Why FDI matters for India**

* Creates jobs and technology transfer
* Strengthens manufacturing and exports
* Provides stable, long-term capital (unlike volatile portfolio flows)

---

### 2. **The News (What Happened?)**

* **Net FDI turned negative for 3 consecutive months**:

  * **August 2025**: −$622 million
  * **September 2025**: −$1.7 billion
  * **October 2025**: −$1.5 billion

* **Triggering event**:

  * End of July 2025: Donald Trump announced **25% tariffs on Indian exports**
  * One week later: tariff raised to **50%**
  * Immediately after → investment sentiment reversed

* **Earlier performance was strong**:

  * April–July 2025 net FDI: **$10.7 billion**
  * Over **3 times** higher than same period last year

* **By end of October 2025**:

  * Cumulative net FDI: **$6.2 billion**
  * Still higher than last year, but **direction has clearly changed**

* **More worrying signal**:

  * Gross FDI inflows in **August & October fell year-on-year**
  * Breaks the earlier 33% growth trend (April–July)

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Policy Context**

Over the past few years, the government has taken multiple steps to attract private investment:

* **2019 Corporate Tax Cuts**

  * Reduced base corporate tax to improve competitiveness
* **Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Schemes**

  * Targeted push to manufacturing (electronics, semiconductors, pharma)
* **Demand-side measures**

  * Income tax relief
  * GST rationalisation
* **Ease of Doing Business reforms**

  * Faster approvals, insolvency reforms, digitisation

👉 These were praised as **“structural reforms”**, yet investor confidence proved **highly sensitive to external shocks**.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance (Analytical Perspective)**

#### a) **What does this episode reveal?**

1. **FDI confidence is fragile**

   * One trade action by a single country triggered capital flight
   * Shows overdependence on **global sentiment**, not domestic strength

2. **Headline growth narratives are insufficient**

   * “Fastest growing economy” works in stable times
   * Investors look for **policy certainty, trade predictability, and risk insulation**

3. **Concern about domestic investment climate**

   * Rising outward FDI by Indian companies:

     * Positive sign of global competitiveness
     * But also raises question: **Why not invest more at home?**

4. **Trade policy uncertainty**

   * Even Reserve Bank of India acknowledged:

     * Uncertainty around U.S. trade deal led to **portfolio exits**
   * FDI and FPI are interconnected through investor confidence

#### b) **Structural issue highlighted**

* Incentives (tax cuts, subsidies) ≠ deep reforms
* Missing elements:

  * Stable trade partnerships
  * Strong dispute-resolution mechanisms
  * Predictable regulatory environment
  * Integration with global value chains

---

### 5. **Way Forward (UPSC-Ready Suggestions)**

**Short-term**

* De-risk trade exposure by diversifying export markets
* Clear communication on trade strategy to reassure investors
* Fast-track bilateral trade agreements beyond single-country dependence

**Medium-term**

* Improve domestic demand sustainability
* Strengthen contract enforcement and judicial speed
* Reduce regulatory uncertainty at State and local levels

**Long-term**

* Deep structural reforms in:

  * Land and labour markets
  * Logistics and infrastructure efficiency
* Move from **incentive-driven investment** to **confidence-driven investment**
* Build India’s image as a **reliable, shock-resistant investment destination**

# A year of dissipating promises for Indian foreign policy
## **India’s Foreign Policy in 2025: From Promise to Precarity — Lessons for 2026**

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

**What is foreign policy?**
Foreign policy is a country’s strategy to secure its **national interest** through diplomacy, trade, security cooperation, and global engagement.

**Core pillars of India’s foreign policy**

* **Strategic autonomy** (not formal alliance politics)
* **Economic diplomacy** (trade, energy, technology)
* **Regional primacy** (Neighbourhood First)
* **Global role** (rules-based order, multilateralism)

By early 2025, India appeared well-positioned on all four pillars.

---

### 2. **The News: What Went Wrong in 2025?**

2025 began with **high expectations**:

* Return of active diplomacy after election-heavy 2024
* Reset of ties with the U.S. under Donald Trump (second term)
* Completion of major **Bilateral Trade Agreements (BTAs)** with:

  * U.S., U.K., EU, Australia, New Zealand
* Tentative thaw with China after LAC standoff
* Strong energy ties with Russia
* Outreach to neighbours: Bangladesh, Pakistan, Taliban, Nepal, Sri Lanka

👉 **By end-2025, most of these expectations collapsed.**

India faced **simultaneous stress** across four domains:

1. Economic security
2. Energy security
3. Global strategic stability
4. Regional security

---

### 3. **Economic & Energy Security Challenges**

#### a) **India–U.S. Relations: Worst Year in Decades**

* U.S. imposed:

  * **25% reciprocal tariff** on Indian exports
  * Hit labour-intensive sectors: apparel, gems & jewellery, seafood
* Additional **25% surcharge on imports of Russian oil**

  * Made India the **most heavily tariffed U.S. trading partner**
* Past trend continued:

  * GSP trade privileges withdrawn during Trump’s first term
* **Immigration restrictions (H-1B visas)**:

  * Hurt remittances and IT sector confidence

Even if a BTA is signed later, **lost contracts and jobs are irreversible in the short run**.

---

#### b) **Trade Diplomacy: Partial Success**

**FTAs signed in 2025**

* U.K.
* Oman
* New Zealand

**Still pending (big prizes)**

* United States
* European Union

👉 This weakened India’s credibility, as leaders had publicly committed to closure in 2025.

---

#### c) **Russia & Energy Dilemma**

* India’s oil imports from Russia surged to **$52 billion**
* After new U.S. sanctions, India appeared to **soften its stance**
* Uncertainty:

  * Will India be forced to **zero out Ural oil imports**, as it did with Iran & Venezuela earlier?
* India–Russia summit:

  * No major agreements in defence, nuclear, space or energy
  * Failed to match the hype

👉 **Strategic autonomy now carries economic and reputational costs.**

---

### 4. **China, Global Order & Strategic Stability**

#### a) **China: Symbolism without Substance**

* High-profile moment:

  * Modi–Xi–Putin photo at **Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Summit (Sept 2025)
* Some restoration:

  * Flights, visas, pilgrimages
* But:

  * No firm LAC security guarantees
  * Investment restrictions still in place
  * Detention of Indian passenger from Arunachal Pradesh in Shanghai (Nov 2025) raised sovereignty concerns

👉 Optics improved, fundamentals did not.

---

#### b) **Changing U.S. Global Strategy**

* **2017 U.S. NSS**:

  * China & Russia = “revisionist powers”
  * India = “leading global power”
* **2025 NSS**:

  * Softened tone on China & Russia
  * India mentioned narrowly (Indo-Pacific, critical minerals)
* Trump’s talk of a **“G-2” with China** alarmed Indian strategists

👉 Deep alignment with Washington now appears **risky**, not reassuring.

---

#### c) **Erosion of Rules-Based Order**

* Acceptance of peace plans on:

  * **Gaza**
  * **Ukraine**
  * (Seen by critics as favouring aggressors)
* China’s push for a **new “Global Governance” framework**
* UN’s declining credibility in conflict resolution

👉 India must articulate **its own vision** of global order, not just react.

---

### 5. **Regional Security & Neighbourhood Challenges**

#### a) **Pakistan & Terrorism**

* **Pahalgam terror attack (April 2025)**:

  * Terrorists penetrated deep into the Valley and escaped

* India’s response:

  * **Operation Sindoor** – militarily effective

* Diplomatic fallout:

  * Global condemnation of terror, but **little support for India’s cross-border action**
  * Speculation about loss of Indian jets hurt credibility
  * Government silence worsened perception

* Pakistan factor:

  * Ultra-hawkish Field Marshal **Asim Munir** shaping policy
  * Saudi–Pakistan mutual defence pact hurt India’s regional balance

---

#### b) **“New Normal” & Escalation Risk**

* PM Modi’s declaration of a “new normal” raised fears of rapid escalation
* India’s restrained handling of **Delhi blasts conspiracy (Nov 2025)** calmed nerves
* Core dilemma remains:

  * How to respond to the **next major terror attack** without diplomatic isolation?

---

#### c) **Neighbourhood Instability**

* **Bangladesh**:

  * 2024 regime-change protests
  * Relations at lowest ebb by end-2025
* **Nepal**:

  * 2025 Gen-Z protests
  * Fragile transitional government
* **Myanmar**:

  * Elections held under Junta terms (Dec 28, 2025)
  * Limited success in engaging NUG or improving conditions for **Aung San Suu Kyi**

👉 Elections in Bangladesh & Nepal (early 2026) may bring **less India-friendly leaderships**.

---

### 6. **Lessons for 2026 (Mains-Oriented Analysis)**

#### a) **Limits of Performative Diplomacy**

* Hugs, hand-holding, awards, photo-ops ≠ strategic gains
* Diplomacy must deliver:

  * Trade access
  * Security assurances
  * Predictability

#### b) **Limits of Performative Aggression**

* Threats to isolate or boycott only work if **others follow**
* Unilateral signalling can backfire

#### c) **Narrative Discipline**

* Shift from:

  * *Vishwaguru* → *Vishwamitra* (good correction)
* Avoid becoming:

  * *Vishwa-victim* (blaming everyone else)

#### d) **Consistency of Principles**

* Credibility gap:

  * Criticising minority violence abroad while ignoring it at home
  * Worrying about democracy in neighbours while engaging Taliban
* In a transactional world, **principles matter only if applied consistently**

---

### 7. **Way Forward for 2026**

**Strategic**

* Rebalance strategic autonomy with coalition-building
* Prepare for multipolar instability, not U.S.-centric order

**Economic**

* Reduce overdependence on single markets
* Fast-track EU & ASEAN trade engagement

**Regional**

* Invest in long-term societal ties, not only governments
* Strengthen intelligence & post-strike diplomacy

**Normative**

* Align domestic conduct with external moral claims
* Build credibility through consistency, not rhetoric

# The urban future with cities as dynamic ecosystems
## **Inclusive Urbanisation & the “Invisible Tax of Exclusion”**

![Image](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQH6vOrLoOK3pg/article-cover_image-shrink_600_2000/article-cover_image-shrink_600_2000/0/1706899705701?e=2147483647\&t=1u5YLnhC-aIGXRwlADK5Yae9qYXjlfSbrr4CO8j7a-8\&v=beta)

---

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

**Why cities matter**

* Cities are engines of **economic growth**, **innovation**, and **governance**
* They attract migrants seeking **jobs, education, safety, and dignity**
* Urban India is increasingly **multi-lingual, multi-cultural, and mobile**

**The core gap**

* There is a **disconnect** between:

  1. **Cities we design** (planners’ imagination)
  2. **Cities we wish to inhabit** (inclusive, modern, smart)
  3. **Cities we actually live in** (unequal, exclusionary)

👉 This gap is the *missing link* in urban development.

---

### 2. **The Central Idea: “Invisible Tax of Exclusion”**

#### a) **What is the linguistic / cultural tax?**

* Migrants are expected to **assimilate immediately**
* Language becomes a **non-negotiable gatekeeper** to belonging
* Failure to speak the “dominant” language leads to:

  * Social exclusion
  * Administrative difficulties
  * Cultural alienation

👉 This is an **unwritten cost** paid by migrants simply for existing in the city.

---

#### b) **Economic consequences of exclusion**

Language and cultural barriers directly affect:

* **Employment**

  * Job search, interviews, contracts
* **Housing**

  * Rental agreements, legal documentation
* **Public services**

  * Health care
  * Welfare schemes
  * Transport systems

Because of these barriers:

* Migrants are pushed into the **informal economy**
* Informality means:

  * Low wages
  * Job insecurity
  * Exploitation
  * No social mobility

👉 Irony:
The city **depends on migrant labour**, yet **denies them equal access**.

---

### 3. **Urban Planning: The Structural Blind Spot**

#### a) **Assumption of homogeneity**

Modern urban planning often assumes:

* A **static**
* **Homogenous**
* Long-settled population

This leads to:

* Infrastructure designed only for “established residents”
* New residents becoming **invisible users**

Example:

* “Smart cities” that are:

  * Digitally advanced
  * But inaccessible to those without language skills or documents

(India’s **Smart Cities Mission** illustrates this contradiction clearly.)

---

#### b) **Governance deficit**

* Local bodies & planning committees often lack:

  * Migrant representation
  * Cultural diversity
* Result:

  * Policies for **heterogeneous populations** made by **homogeneous decision-makers**

Impact:

* Schools
* Transport hubs
* Public parks
  are poorly aligned with new demographic realities.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance: Analytical Perspective**

#### a) **Urbanisation & Social Justice (GS-I / GS-II)**

* Exclusion violates:

  * Right to equality
  * Right to dignified life
* Language becomes a **proxy for citizenship**

#### b) **Urban Economy (GS-III)**

* Informalisation reduces:

  * Productivity
  * Tax base
  * Long-term growth
* Cities harm their own **economic resilience**

#### c) **Governance & Ethics (GS-IV)**

* Lack of empathy in design = ethical failure
* Democratic governance demands:

  * Recognition
  * Participation
  * Inclusion

---

### 5. **Designing Cities “For All”: Way Forward**

#### a) **Rethinking cities**

* Cities are not:

  * Fixed blueprints
* They are:

  * **Dynamic ecosystems**
  * Continuously reshaped by people

Shift mindset from:

* “Who belongs here?”
  to
* “How do we include everyone who is here?”

---

#### b) **Practical interventions**

**1. Multilingual governance**

* Public signage in multiple languages
* Translation support in:

  * Hospitals
  * Police stations
  * Municipal offices

**2. Cultural sensitisation**

* Training for public-facing staff
* Focus on:

  * Operational efficiency
  * Democratic rights
  * Respect, not charity

**3. Inclusive planning**

* Representation of migrants in:

  * Ward committees
  * Urban planning bodies
* Use real-time demographic data

**4. Accept temporary disruption**

* Inclusion may cause short-term friction
* Long-term gains:

  * Social cohesion
  * Economic stability
  * Reduced conflict

---

### 6. **The Missing Link: Empathy**

True urban success is not measured by:

* Flyovers
* Smart dashboards
* Skyscrapers

But by:

* **Comfort**
* **Security**
* **Validated belonging** of lived experience

Empathy is not a soft value — it is **urban infrastructure**.
