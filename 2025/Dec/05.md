# New report maps India’s DPI 2.0 future
## **Assessment of India’s Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI): UPI’s Role & the New CDPG–IIMB Report**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

#### **What is Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI)?**

DPI refers to foundational digital systems that enable secure, interoperable, people-centric public and private service delivery. It is built on three key layers:

1. **Digital Identity** → Aadhaar
2. **Digital Payments** → UPI, FASTag
3. **Data Exchanges & Platforms** → DigiLocker, Account Aggregator, CoWIN, ONDC, Health Stack

These systems act as “public digital rails” on which government agencies and private companies build services.

#### **Why is UPI the Face of DPI?**

* It enables instant, interoperable, low-cost payments.
* Works across banks, apps, QR codes, and merchants.
* Has become embedded in everyday life—rent, salaries, street vendors, utility bills, e-commerce, transport, etc.

In **August 2025**, UPI recorded:

* **20,008.31 million transactions**
* **₹24.85 lakh crore in value** — globally unmatched scale.

This forms the backdrop of the new **"State of DPI in India 2025"** report.

### **Conclusion**

China’s rural transformation is a blend of **state investment**, **local participation**, and a cultural ethos of resilience — seen in the “Xichou spirit”. While skyscrapers symbolise China’s global rise, its rural landscapes tell the deeper story of human effort, ecological wisdom, and political ambition.
For China to achieve “socialist modernisation” by 2035, rural revitalisation must remain at the centre of national strategy, ensuring prosperity spreads from coastal megacities to mountain villages alike.
