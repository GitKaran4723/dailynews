# Govt. withdraws order to install Sanchar Saathi app
## **Sanchar Saathi Mandate Withdrawal — DoT’s Reversal Explained**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

To understand this issue, a few key concepts must be clear:

#### **a. What is the Sanchar Saathi App?**

A government platform developed by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) to:

* Track lost or stolen mobile phones (via CEIR—Central Equipment Identity Register)
* Check the number of active mobile connections in one’s name
* Report fraudulent or unauthorized SIM cards
* Enhance citizen security in telecom services

It is part of India’s broader digital governance and cybersecurity framework.

#### **b. What is TIUE (Telecommunication Identifier User Entity)?**

* A **new category created by DoT** recently.
* It includes **any entity using telecom identifiers** (like phone numbers) — not just telecom operators.
* This expands DoT’s regulatory reach to banks, app companies, fintech services, etc.

#### **c. Why was the mandate controversial?**

The original DoT order required **smartphone manufacturers to pre-install the Sanchar Saathi app** on all devices sold starting next year.
Concerns raised:

* **Privacy and surveillance fears**
* **Forced installation without user consent**
* **Opaque rule-making**, as the order was not publicly released
* **Expansion of DoT powers** without parliamentary debate

This resembles debates globally about bloatware and state-imposed apps.

---

### **2. The News**

* On **Wednesday**, the **Department of Telecommunications (DoT)** formally **withdrew its earlier direction** ordering smartphone manufacturers to **preload Sanchar Saathi** on all devices from next year.
* The reversal came after **widespread backlash** by citizens, civil society, Opposition leaders, and internet freedom groups.
* DoT argued that the mandate was no longer needed because **Sanchar Saathi downloads had risen significantly on their own**.
* Earlier, DoT had issued **three directions** under its new TIUE powers, one of which included this preload mandate.
* Communications Minister **Jyotiraditya Scindia** defended the app in Parliament, citing:

  * **1.5 crore fraudulent mobile numbers disconnected**
  * **26 lakh lost or stolen phones traced**
* But he also stated the government was “open to feedback,” signalling willingness to withdraw the order.

---

### **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

#### **a. Key Telecom Governance Measures**

* **Telecom Bill, 2023 (proposed):** modernises telecom laws with provisions on security, identification, and digital governance.
* **CEIR (Central Equipment Identity Register):** national database to block or trace smartphones using IMEI.
* **Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDP), 2023:** governs data privacy, storage, and processing.
* **Sanchar Saathi Platform (2022–23):** public-facing tool to empower users against SIM fraud.

#### **b. Why did DoT introduce TIUE?**

* To regulate not just telecom operators but **any entity using telecom identifiers**, including banks, logistics firms, app-based platforms.
* Intended to improve fraud prevention and accountability.

#### **c. Past Government Steps Against Telecom Fraud**

* Mandatory **know-your-customer (KYC)** for SIM activation
* **AI-based facial recognition systems (ASTR) to detect multiple SIM misuse**
* Telecom Analytics for Fraud Management and Consumer Protection (TAFCOP)

### **4. Mains Relevance**

This issue intersects with **privacy**, **governance**, **digital rights**, **bureaucratic accountability**, and **regulatory overreach** — all key UPSC Mains themes.

#### **a. Key Issues & Challenges**

1. **Privacy vs Security**

   * Forced pre-installation of a government app raises fears of surveillance, even if the app itself claims minimal data usage.
   * Citizens expect **informed consent** for apps on their devices.

2. **Regulatory Overreach**

   * Creating TIUE expands DoT’s powers to regulate non-telecom entities without parliamentary scrutiny.
   * Raises concerns about **executive overreach** and **lack of transparency**.

3. **Procedural Opacity**

   * The mandate was not publicly notified; it was leaked.
   * Violates norms of **stakeholder consultation**, a cornerstone of good governance.

4. **Digital Governance Trust Deficit**

   * Even beneficial apps face public distrust if the government appears coercive.
   * Trust is central to adoption of digital public infrastructure (like UPI, DigiLocker).

5. **Political and Civil Society Pushback**

   * Opposition MPs and digital rights groups accused the government of trying to control devices.
   * Reinforces the need for **public debate** on data protection and telecom surveillance.

#### **b. Impacts**

* **Society:**

  * Raises questions about citizens’ digital autonomy.
  * Could have set a precedent for more compulsory apps.

* **Economy/Industry:**

  * Smartphone manufacturers resist mandates that increase device clutter and reduce consumer choice.
  * Regulatory unpredictability may deter investment.

* **Polity/Governance:**

  * Highlights tension between **national security** and **individual rights**.
  * Tests the robustness of India's constitutional right to privacy (Puttaswamy, 2017).

* **Ethics:**

  * Coercion vs choice
  * Transparency vs secrecy
  * Public interest vs state control

---

### **5. Way Forward**

1. **Adopt a Consultative Rule-Making Process**

   * Public release of draft orders
   * Multi-stakeholder consultations (industry, civil society, privacy experts)

2. **Ensure Voluntary Adoption of Government Apps**

   * Instead of preloading, encourage:

     * Awareness campaigns
     * Integration with existing government digital platforms
     * Incentivizing users to download the app voluntarily

3. **Limit Regulatory Ambiguity**

   * Clearly define the scope and powers of TIUEs
   * Parliamentary oversight to prevent opaque executive expansion of authority

4. **Privacy-by-Design**

   * Apps must adhere to minimal data collection norms under DPDP
   * Third-party audits to build trust

5. **Strengthen Digital Literacy**

   * Particularly in rural and elderly populations
   * Empower users to identify fraud without mandating apps

6. **Proportionate Regulation**

   * Any government digital initiative must follow the principles of:

     * **Necessity**
     * **Legality**
     * **Proportionality**
     * **Transparency**

# Sting in the tail
## **Cyclone Ditwah & Chennai Flooding — A Comprehensive Analysis**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

#### **a. What is a Cyclone?**

A **tropical cyclone** is an intense low-pressure system over warm oceans, characterised by strong winds and heavy rainfall. Its behaviour is influenced by:

* Sea surface temperatures
* Wind shear
* Atmospheric moisture
* Steering winds

Cyclones can weaken or reintensify depending on environmental conditions, and slow-moving systems often cause *prolonged rainfall*, leading to flooding.

#### **b. Why Slow-Moving Cyclones Are Dangerous**

When a cyclone moves slowly, it:

* Dumps rain repeatedly over the same region
* Saturates soil and river basins
* Overwhelms drainage networks
* Raises water levels in both urban and rural catchments

Thus, even without extreme wind speeds, slow systems like **Cyclone Ditwah** can cause severe floods.

#### **c. Chennai’s Hydrological Context**

Chennai is vulnerable to floods due to:

* **Flat terrain**, limiting natural drainage
* **Three rivers** (Cooum, Adyar, Kosasthalaiyar) cutting across the city
* **Low-lying coastal zones**
* **Urbanisation leading to shrinking wetlands and paved surfaces**
* **Dependence on monsoonal rainfall** concentrated in a few weeks

Drainage upgrades alone cannot make such a landscape flood-proof.

---

### **2. The News**

Cyclone Ditwah travelled unusually slowly across Sri Lanka in **November 2024**, dropping extensive rainfall. Key developments include:

* Over **14 lakh people affected** in Sri Lanka; **474 deaths reported**.
* After crossing the island, the storm **re-entered the Bay of Bengal**, briefly intensified, and then moved toward **north Tamil Nadu and south Andhra Pradesh**.
* By **December 1**, the weakened system lingered off **Chennai’s coast** as a deep depression.
* On **December 2**, Chennai received **18 cm of rain in 24 hours**, resulting in:

  * City-wide **waterlogging**
  * **Drain closures** due to reverse flow
  * Pumping operations to remove stagnant water
* The Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) revealed:

  * ₹5,200 crore spent over 4 years
  * ~1,100 km of new storm drains constructed
  * Only 75% of work completed
  * Smaller link corrections still pending

Recent floods in north Chennai exposed:

* Encroachments on Kosasthalaiyar River
* Poor desilting
* Reduced flood tolerance

Meanwhile, the **Thiruppugazh Committee Report** (600 pages) remains unpublished despite being cited for infrastructure changes.

---

### **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

#### **a. At the State Level (Tamil Nadu)**

* Creation of the **Thiruppugazh Committee (2021)** after major floods to propose a basin-wise urban flood management strategy.
* **Stormwater drain upgrades** across Chennai after the 2015 and 2023 floods.
* Construction of **artificial water bodies** and **retention ponds** in select basins.
* Seeking Central assistance for an **Integrated Urban Flood Management Project** with multi-basin coordination.

#### **b. At the Central Level**

* **National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA)** guidelines on urban flooding.
* **AMRUT Mission** support for water supply and drainage infrastructure.
* **Central Water Commission (CWC) flood forecasting** for major rivers.

#### **c. Municipal-Level Action**

* GCC investment in drains, pumps, desilting, and real-time flood monitoring.
* Microdrainage reconnection projects (still incomplete).
* Use of **GIS-based flood maps**, though not widely disseminated.

---

### **4. Mains Relevance**

This news is highly relevant for topics like **Disaster Management**, **Urbanisation**, **Climate Change**, and **Governance**.

#### **a. Key Issues & Challenges**

1. **Infrastructure Deficits**

   * Only partial implementation of upgraded drains.
   * Missing micro-drainage links cause localised waterlogging.
   * Encroachment and faulty desilting reduce river capacity.

2. **Poor Transparency**

   * The Thiruppugazh Committee Report remains unpublished.
   * No publicly available consolidated implementation roadmap.

3. **Governance and Coordination Failures**

   * Basin-level approach needed across administrative boundaries (Tiruvallur, Kancheepuram, Chennai).
   * Existing flood maps and elevation models not used consistently for planning or relief.

4. **Urban Planning Issues**

   * Uncontrolled construction in low-lying and flood-prone areas.
   * Loss of wetlands (e.g., Pallikaranai), lakes, and drainage channels.
   * Increase in impermeable surfaces reduces groundwater recharge.

5. **Climate Change Impacts**

   * More erratic, intense, and slow-moving cyclones.
   * Frequent high-intensity rainfall events beyond design capacity.

6. **Social Impact**

   * Loss of homes, livelihoods, and mobility for vulnerable populations.
   * Traffic paralysis, power cuts, contamination of water.
   * Exposes inadequacies of emergency response, especially in slums.

#### **b. Broader Implications**

* Highlights India’s lack of **urban flood resilience** despite repeated disasters.
* Shows gap between planned infrastructure and actual implementation.
* Raises need for **scientific urban planning**, **community resilience**, and **data transparency**.

---

### **5. Way Forward**

1. **Publish the Thiruppugazh Report & Ensure Transparency**

   * Make recommendations public.
   * Present basin-wise implementation timelines.

2. **Adopt a Basin-Based Flood Management Strategy**

# A dismantling of the base of environmental regulation
## **CREDAI vs Vanashakti Review Judgment**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

#### **a. What is an Environmental Clearance (EC)?**

An **Environmental Clearance** is a *prior approval* required for certain categories of industrial, mining, and infrastructure projects under the **Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification, 2006**.
It demands:

* Environmental Impact Studies
* Public Hearings
* Expert Appraisal Committee reports
* Imposition of conditions to prevent irreversible damage

The **core philosophy**: *prevention, not post-facto regularisation of harm*.

#### **b. What is ex post facto (retrospective) EC?**

A clearance given **after** a project has already begun construction or operations *without prior permission*.
Legally controversial because:

* It rewards illegal commencement
* It undermines scientific and public scrutiny
* It violates the precautionary principle and environmental rule of law

#### **c. Background to the case**

* **2017 Notification:** Allowed violators to apply for retrospective EC within 6 months.
* **2021 Office Memorandum:** Created SOP to regularise even those who *missed* the 2017 window.
* **May 2025 Judgment (Justice A.S. Oka):** Struck down both as illegal and unconstitutional.
* **November 2025 Review (2:1 majority):** Recalled the earlier judgment, reinstated the possibility of retrospective clearances.

The dissent (Justice Ujjal Bhuyan) strongly criticised the majority for undermining environmental jurisprudence.

---

### **2. The News**

On **November 18, 2025**, the **Supreme Court (2:1 majority)** in *CREDAI vs Vanashakti* **recalled its earlier May 2025 judgment** that had declared retrospective ECs illegal.

Key points:

* Majority held that denying ex post facto ECs completely could harm public interest since demolishing completed projects may waste resources.
* Justice Bhuyan dissented, calling the logic *circular*—violations themselves are treated as justification for legalising them.
* The review judgment sidelines decades of environmental principles, including:

  * **Precautionary principle**
  * **Intergenerational equity**
  * **Article 21-based environmental rights**

The matter will now be heard afresh by the Court.

---

### **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

#### **a. Existing Legal Framework**

* **Environment (Protection) Act, 1986**
* **EIA Notification, 1994 & 2006**
* **Public Hearing and Expert Appraisal processes**

These frameworks were created to ensure *prior scrutiny*.

#### **b. 2017 & 2021 Notifications (MoEFCC)**

* 2017 allowed one-time retrospective EC applications.
* Government promised it was *one-time only* (before Madras High Court).
* 2021 SOP expanded regularisation even further through penalties.

The May 2025 judgment had struck down both for diluting preventive regulation.

#### **c. Supreme Court’s Earlier Stance**

The Court has repeatedly held:

* In **Common Cause vs Union of India (2017)**: Retrospective ECs are “detrimental to the environment”.
* In **M.C. Mehta** mining cases: Even renewal of leases requires *prior* approvals.
* Post-Stockholm 1972 jurisprudence emphasises *prevention, not accommodation of harm*.

The new review judgment departs from this longstanding line.

---

### **4. Mains Relevance**

This issue is extremely important for **GS-II (Judiciary, Governance)** and **GS-III (Environment, Disaster Management, EIA)**.

#### **a. Key Issues & Challenges**

1. **Erosion of Environmental Rule of Law**

   * Turning violations into justification for clearances weakens the entire regulatory framework.
   * Encourages a “construct now, legalise later” culture.

2. **Breakdown of Precautionary Principle**

   * Clearances are meant to be *preventive*, not curative.
   * Backdated approvals make environmental protection secondary to economic interests.

3. **Collapse of Accountability**

   * Violators face no serious consequence; fines alone cannot remedy environmental damage.
   * Enforcement becomes symbolic rather than deterrent.

4. **Institutional Inconsistency**

   * Court’s reversal undermines its own credibility.
   * It contradicts decades of rich environmental jurisprudence (Article 21).

5. **Weak Public Participation**

   * Post-facto ECs eliminate:

     * Public hearings
     * Community objections
     * Scientific scrutiny
   * Environmental democracy is compromised.

6. **Climate Change Context**

   * At a time of increasing ecological stress, weakening oversight sends a dangerous signal.
   * India’s commitments under Paris Agreement and sustainable development goals may be jeopardised.

#### **b. Impacts**

* **Environmental Impact**

  * Permanent ecological degradation may become “regularisable”.
  * Sensitive ecosystems face unchecked exploitation.

* **Governance Impact**

  * Regulatory arbitrariness increases; compliance becomes voluntary.
  * Violations become the norm rather than the exception.

* **Economic Impact**

  * Poor enforcement may attract opportunistic investment but harms long-term sustainability.
  * High externalities borne by local communities.

* **Social Impact**

  * Marginalised communities (tribal, rural, coastal) face displacement, pollution, and loss of livelihoods with limited recourse.

* **Judicial Credibility**

  * Frequent reviews and reversals risk eroding trust in the Supreme Court.

---

### **5. Way Forward**

1. **Reaffirm the Primacy of Prior EC**

   * SC must restore the foundational principle that environmental clearance cannot be retrospective except in truly exceptional situations.

2. **Legislative Clarification**

   * Parliament should codify strict, limited circumstances (if any) where ex post facto EC may be granted.
   * Define penalties severe enough to deter violations.

3. **Strengthen Compliance Mechanisms**

   * Mandatory environmental audits.
   * Quarterly compliance reports accessible to the public.
   * Use remote sensing and technology for monitoring.

4. **Transparent Public Participation**

   * Restore meaningful public hearings.
   * Ensure communities have access to EIA data in local languages.

5. **Judicial Consistency**

   * SC benches handling environmental matters should follow established environmental jurisprudence unless constitutionally compelling reasons exist to deviate.

6. **Independent Environmental Regulator**

   * As recommended in *Lafarge* case (2011), create a National Environmental Regulator to assess, monitor, and enforce EC conditions.

7. **Stronger Penalties**

   * Instead of fines that become a “cost of doing business”, impose:

     * Criminal liability for deliberate violations
     * Cancellation of project approvals
     * Restoration obligations

8. **Climate-Sensitive EIA**

   * Integrate climate risk analysis into EC processes.
   * Require assessments of cumulative and long-term impacts.

# Taking the leap
## **SC Intervention on Leprosy Stigma & Discriminatory Laws — A Structured UPSC Analysis**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

#### **a. What is Leprosy?**

* A chronic infectious disease caused by **Mycobacterium leprae**.
* Damages **skin, peripheral nerves, eyes, and limbs**.
* Contrary to historical belief, it is:

  * **Not highly contagious**
  * **Completely curable** with **Multi-Drug Therapy (MDT)**
  * Early detection prevents disability

#### **b. Why is Leprosy Stigmatised?**

Stigma is rooted in:

* **Ancient myths**, religious beliefs, ideas of impurity
* Fear and misinformation due to visible physical deformities
* Colonial-era laws that treated persons with leprosy as “unclean” or “dangerous”
* Social isolation and exclusion historically imposed on patients

Even after medical advances, stigma persists because **laws and social norms have not evolved**.

#### **c. India and the Global Burden**

* India accounts for **57% of global leprosy cases**.
* Vulnerability is higher in areas with:

  * **Poor sanitation**, overcrowding
  * **Genetic predisposition**
  * Limited access to healthcare

---

### **2. The News**

The **Supreme Court of India**, while hearing petitions against discriminatory provisions targeting persons with leprosy, directed:

* The **National Human Rights Commission (NHRC)** to review existing laws.
* NHRC reported that **97 Central and State laws** still contain discriminatory clauses.
* These laws restrict basic rights such as:

  * Access to **public transport**
  * Entry into **public spaces**
  * Eligibility to **contest elections**
  * Employment and business opportunities

The SC has now asked all States and Union Territories to submit reports on steps taken to repeal or amend such laws.

The NHRC has recommended:

* **Early detection**, timely treatment, rehabilitation
* Removal of derogatory terminology
* Use of **iris scans in Aadhaar enrolment** (since leprosy affects fingerprints)
* Enacting a central law to eliminate discriminatory practices

The Court emphasised that with modern medical knowledge, retaining such antiquated legal provisions is unacceptable.

---

### **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

#### **a. Health Interventions**

* **National Leprosy Eradication Programme (NLEP)**

  * Provides free MDT, disability prevention, and awareness campaigns.
* **ASHAs and frontline workers** trained to identify early symptoms.
* **IEC campaigns** to dispel myths.

#### **b. Legal and Policy Measures**

* **Elimination of Discrimination Against Persons Affected by Leprosy Bill, 2015** (introduced but not passed).
* **Personal Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2018** proposed removal of leprosy as a ground for divorce.
* Various states have abolished provisions allowing segregation of people with leprosy.

#### **c. NHRC Recommendations (2021–2025)**

* Replace pejorative terms like “leper” with respectful terminology.
* Ensure rehabilitation, social inclusion, livelihood support.
* Remove discriminatory statutory clauses.
* Use of iris-based Aadhaar enrolment.

#### **d. Judicial Interventions**

* SC directions mandating:

  * Submission of action-taken reports by all states/UTs.
  * Uniform policy approach to eliminate discriminatory laws.
  * Recognition of the dignity and rights of persons affected by leprosy.

---

### **4. Mains Relevance**

This topic intersects **GS-II (Governance, Social Justice)** and **GS-III (Health, Vulnerable Sections)**.

#### **a. Key Issues & Challenges**

1. **Legal Discrimination**

   * Nearly a hundred outdated laws treat leprosy as a public threat.
   * These laws violate **Article 14**, **Article 19**, and **Article 21**.

2. **Social Stigma & Exclusion**

   * Despite curability, stigma fuels isolation, unemployment, and mental stress.
   * Women and children affected face double discrimination.

3. **Policy Gaps**

   * Lack of a comprehensive anti-discrimination law.
   * Slow legislative reform despite NHRC recommendations.

4. **Healthcare Challenges**

   * Late detection leads to disabilities.
   * NLEP has weakened over years due to complacency post "elimination" target.

5. **Human Rights Concerns**

   * Outdated laws violate dignity and equality.
   * Denial of public spaces and services violates fundamental freedoms.

6. **Governance Failure**

   * Delay in repealing discriminatory laws despite medical evidence.
   * Poor data awareness and inadequate rehabilitation mechanisms.

#### **b. Ethical Dimensions**

* Justice, dignity, compassion, and non-discrimination.
* Responsibility of the state to protect vulnerable groups.
* Importance of evidence-based policymaking rather than prejudice.

---

### **5. Way Forward**

1. **Repeal or Amend All Discriminatory Laws**

   * Central and State governments must act swiftly, guided by NHRC’s list.
   * Enact a **comprehensive anti-discrimination act for persons with leprosy**.

2. **Ensure Dignified Terminology**

   * Replace stigmatizing terms in all laws, rules, and official documents.

3. **Strengthen Public Awareness Campaigns**

# The climate is breaching the wall of urban metrics
## **Urban Liveability Indices, Climate Extremes, and the Asian Floods**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

#### **a. What are Liveability and Prosperity Indices?**

Cities today are ranked globally using composite indices that claim to measure how “modern” or “liveable” they are. Common examples include:

1. **UN-Habitat City Prosperity Index (CPI)**
   Measures:

   * Productivity
   * Infrastructure
   * Quality of life
   * Equity
   * Environmental sustainability
   * Urban governance

2. **Global Liveability Index (Economist Intelligence Unit)**
   Scores cities on:

   * Stability
   * Healthcare
   * Culture & environment
   * Education
   * Infrastructure

3. **City Resilience Index (by Arup)**
   Focuses on ability to **withstand and recover** from shocks (including extreme weather), across:

   * Health & well-being
   * Economy & society
   * Infrastructure & environment
   * Leadership & strategy

#### **b. Limitations of Existing Paradigms**

While these indices measure productivity, services, and governance, they **do not adequately assess**:

* Drainage capacity for extreme cloudbursts
* Slope stability and landslide vulnerability
* Safe, affordable housing outside hazard zones
* Ability to cope with 21st-century climate extremes

Thus, their definition of “modernity” does not align with the realities of a warming planet.

#### **c. Why Compare Indian Metros?**

Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, and Chennai are often grouped as “major metros”, but:

* Their ability to **withstand cyclones, extreme rainfall, and flooding varies widely**.
* Existing liveability rankings fail to capture climate resilience differences.

This is not an India-only issue — recent floods across **Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines** reveal a global blind spot.

---

### **2. The News**

#### **The Asian Flood Events and What They Exposed**

1. **Sri Lanka (Cyclone Ditwah)**

   * Over **400 deaths**
   * Tens of thousands displaced
   * Landslides in hill towns and major flooding in Colombo

2. **Indonesia (Sumatra)**

   * Cyclonic storms triggered catastrophic flooding
   * River valley villages wiped out
   * Hundreds killed

3. **Southern Thailand (Hat Yai)**

   * Heaviest rainfall in centuries
   * Several-metre-deep floodwaters
   * Failures in early warning and evacuation

4. **Philippines (Typhoon Kalmaegi)**

   * Visayas region, including Cebu, inundated
   * Dozens dead
   * Lakhs displaced

**Yet, many of these secondary cities (Hat Yai, Cebu, hill towns around Colombo) do not even appear in global indices**, despite being deeply integrated into national economies.

**The core issue:**
Global indices *exclude* the very cities and regions where climate vulnerability is greatest.

---

### **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

#### **a. National and Urban Policy Relevance (India)**

Although India is not the centre of the article, the themes directly relate to Indian governance:

* **AMRUT**, **Smart Cities Mission**, **National Urban Health Mission**
* **National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA)** guidelines for urban flooding and landslide risk
* **Climate Smart Cities Assessment Framework**
* **State Action Plans on Climate Change (SAPCC)**
* **Drainage Master Plans** under many State governments

These programmes attempt to integrate resilience, but gaps persist in planning, enforcement, and financing.

#### **b. Global Frameworks**

* **Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015–2030)**
* **Paris Agreement commitments**
* **UN-Habitat Urban Resilience programmes**

Yet global indices often lag behind these principles in what they measure.

---

### **4. Mains Relevance**

This topic is crucial for **GS-I (Urbanisation)**, **GS-III (Environment, Disaster Management)**, **GS-II (Governance)**, and **Essay**.

#### **a. Key Issues & Challenges Highlighted**

1. **Flawed Metrics of Modernity**

   * Indices measure amenities (schools, parks, metros) instead of climate resilience.
   * Infrastructure like airports or flyovers “scores points”, while drains, culverts, and slope stabilisation do not.

2. **Climate Extremes Are Outpacing Urban Systems**

   * Many Asian cities were designed for 19th- or 20th-century rainfall levels, not 300–500 mm cloudbursts.
   * Grey infrastructure collapses under climate-stressed conditions.

3. **Inequitable Impacts of Flooding**

   * Wealthier citizens have better housing, mobility, and insurance.
   * Peri-urban and informal settlers live on unstable slopes or floodplains — first to suffer, last to recover.
   * Indices mask intra-city inequalities because they rely on **averages**.

4. **Misallocation of Capital**

   * Cities with high “business climate” scores attract more investment—
     even if located on floodplains or ecologically fragile hillsides.
   * Risk gets “priced out” of decision-making.

5. **Planning Processes Become Performative**

   * International agencies require indicators; richer cities can produce them more easily.
   * Projects become oriented around **meeting reporting requirements**, not solving real flood or landslide risks.

6. **Political Economy Problem**

   * Politicians prioritise projects that show visible “modernity” (metros, expressways).
   * Maintenance of drains, slope stabilisation, and relocation of settlements get neglected as they yield few political rewards.

#### **b. Broader Implications**

* Urban development models still mirror **20th-century assumptions**, not climate realities.
* Indices shape national policy, investment flows, and even professional education — embedding flawed priorities.

---

### **5. Way Forward**

1. **Redesign Liveability and Resilience Indices**

   * Include metrics such as:

     * Peak drainage capacity
     * Floodplain occupancy levels
     * Landslide vulnerability mapping
     * Proportion of population in safe, planned housing
     * Percentage of municipal budget spent on resilience

2. **Integrate Climate Science in Urban Planning**

   * Mandatory climate stress tests for new infrastructure.
   * Update building codes for slope safety and drainage performance.
   * Use hydrological modelling for master plans.

3. **Prioritise Invisible but Critical Infrastructure**

   * Desilting, culverts, stormwater drains, retention ponds.
   * Enforce periodic audits and citizen reporting systems.

4. **Strengthen Early Warning Systems**

   * High-resolution weather forecasting

# A missing link in India’s mineral mission
## **India’s Rare-Earth Magnet Scheme & the Midstream Challenge — A Structured UPSC Analysis**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

#### **a. What are Critical Minerals?**

Critical minerals are raw materials essential for:

* Clean energy (solar, EVs, wind turbines)
* Electronics and semiconductors
* Defence and aerospace
* Telecommunications and pharmaceuticals

Examples: lithium, cobalt, nickel, copper, rare earth elements, graphite, tungsten, titanium.

They are **“critical”** because:

* They are hard to substitute
* They are geographically concentrated
* Their refining is dominated by a few countries (mainly China)

#### **b. What is the Critical Minerals Value Chain?**

1. **Upstream:** Exploration & mining
2. **Midstream:** *Processing, refining, chemical conversion*
3. **Downstream:** Manufacturing of batteries, magnets, chips, alloys

India’s problem lies in the **midstream**—it mines some minerals but does not refine them at scale or purity required for high-tech applications.

#### **c. Rare-Earth Magnets**

Used in:

* Wind turbines
* Electric vehicles
* Drones, missiles
* Smartphones & telecom hardware

China currently dominates >90% of global refining capacity.

#### **d. Why Processing Matters More Than Mining?**

Raw ore has low value. Most economic value is created when:

* Rare earth oxides → metals
* Metals → alloys
* Alloys → magnets or high-purity inputs

Thus, exporting raw minerals = exporting value and jobs.

---

### **2. The News**

The **Union Cabinet** approved a **₹7,280 crore Rare-Earth Permanent Magnet (REPM) scheme** to promote *domestic refining, alloy-making, and magnet production*.

Key developments:

* Reinforces India’s shift from “mining focus” to **value addition**.
* Aligns with new **G-20 framework on critical minerals** emphasising midstream manufacturing.
* Comes amid rising U.S.–China trade tensions and Chinese export restrictions on rare earths and battery technologies.
* India currently imports almost all lithium, cobalt, and nickel, and lacks large-scale refining capacity.

Other recent policy actions:

* A **₹1,500 crore critical minerals recycling scheme**
* Reforms under the **MMDR Act** (exploration licences, national auctions, mineral exchange)
* Launch of the **National Critical Minerals Mission (NCMM)** with Centres of Excellence

The article highlights the urgency of scaling India’s **domestic processing ecosystem**.

### **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

#### **a. National Critical Minerals Mission (NCMM)**

* Sets up nine **Centres of Excellence** for R&D
* Skilled workforce development (₹100 crore)
* Stockpiling for strategic reserves
* Overseas asset acquisition

#### **b. Rare-Earth Magnet Scheme (₹7,280 crore)**

* Aims to build integrated facilities from oxide → metal → alloy → magnet
* Encourages private and global investment
* Reduces dependence on Chinese imports

#### **c. Critical Minerals Recycling Scheme (₹1,500 crore)**

Promotes recovery of metals from:

* Coal fly ash (rare earths)
* Red mud (gallium)
* Zinc residues (cobalt)
* Steel slag (vanadium)

#### **d. MMDR Act Amendments**

* Exploration licences
* National auctions
* Mining-associated minerals clarified
* Portal for mineral trading (mineral exchange)

These help India dig more, but **not refine more**, which remains the biggest gap.

#### **e. International Engagement**

* G-20 Critical Minerals Framework
* Bilateral partnerships (Australia, Argentina, Mongolia, Africa)
* QUAD discussions on resilient supply chains
