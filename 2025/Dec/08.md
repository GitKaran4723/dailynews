# Balance, not swing
# **India–Russia Annual Summit and Strategic Signals**

## **1. Basic Understanding**

### **Historical Context of India–Russia Relations**

* India–Russia ties date back to the Soviet era, marked by defence cooperation, nuclear energy projects, and political support.
* In **2000**, the two countries institutionalised their partnership as a **“Strategic Partnership”**, alongside the mechanism of **Annual Summits**.
* Russia remains a key defence supplier and a major energy partner, especially after India began importing discounted Russian crude post-Ukraine war.

### **Ukraine War & Its Geopolitical Impact**

* Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (2022) led to:

  * Near-total estrangement from the West.
  * Severe economic sanctions.
  * ICC arrest warrant against President Putin.
* India has followed a policy of **strategic autonomy**, avoiding condemnation of Russia while calling for dialogue and peace.

### **Western Pressures on India**

* Western sanctions have complicated India’s oil imports and payments.
* U.S. tariff surcharges (25%) and restrictions on shipping insurance and financial channels have added costs to India–Russia energy ties.

---

## **2. The News**

* **25 years** of India–Russia strategic partnership were marked by President **Vladimir Putin’s first visit to India since the Ukraine war**.
* Despite Russia’s escalating attacks on Ukraine and the ICC warrant, **India accorded a state visit** and PM Modi received Putin personally.
* Key messages for global audiences:

  1. **Putin remains a friend**, despite Western isolation efforts.
  2. India supports **peace**, but will not publicly criticise Russia.
  3. Despite economic pressures, India seeks **new areas of engagement** with Russia.
* **Takeaways** from the Modi–Putin meet:

  * Labour mobility agreement.
  * MoU to establish a **joint urea plant in Russia**.
  * Adoption of an **economic roadmap** (trade expansion, maritime connectivity, national currency payments).
* **Notably absent**: any announcements on defence, nuclear energy, or space—areas sensitive to Western scrutiny.
* India also **did not commit** to increasing Russian oil imports, making the $100 bn trade target by 2030 more difficult.
* Mr. Modi described Russia as India’s “**Dhruv Tara**”—a stable, guiding partner.
* But omission of strategic deals indicates India remains mindful of Western reactions, given ongoing negotiations with the U.S. and EU.

---

## **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

# Surveillance apps in welfare, snake oil for accountability
# **Tech-Fixes, Accountability, and the Crisis of Responsibility in Indian Welfare Governance**

## **1. Basic Understanding**

### **Accountability vs Responsibility**

* **Accountability** = ensuring that workers perform tasks because someone else is monitoring them.
* **Responsibility** = self-motivated action taken in the public interest; internal ethics rather than external policing.
* Jean Drèze & Amartya Sen argue that responsibility is deeper, more sustainable, and essential for welfare outcomes.

### **Tech-Fixes in Governance**

* Technologies such as:

  * **Biometric attendance systems**,
  * **NMMS app for NREGA**,
  * **Facial Recognition Technology (FRT)** for Poshan Tracker,
  * **Aadhaar-based biometric authentication (ABBA)** for PDS
    are seen as solutions to corruption, absenteeism, and data manipulation.

### **Agnotology**

* Coined by Robert Proctor: refers to **the deliberate creation or maintenance of ignorance**.
* Applied here, it means **choosing to ignore evidence of failures** of tech-tools because they serve vested interests or create profitable markets.

---

## **2. The News**

* Digital surveillance tools aimed at improving accountability are becoming widespread in India:

  * Cleaning staff filming themselves,
  * Biometric attendance for government employees,
  * **NMMS app** for NREGA attendance,
  * **FRT** for distribution of Take-Home Rations,
  * **ABBA** for PDS rations.
* These tools often fail to curb corruption and may even **create new avenues of fraud**:

  * Random photographs uploaded on NMMS,
  * Photographs of photographs,
  * Manipulated FRT compliance,
  * Biometric authentication used to mask ration theft.
* Workers—ANMs, Anganwadi workers, nurses—face **demotivation, humiliation, and penalties** due to glitches, connectivity issues, and unreasonable expectations.
* Despite evidence of failure, ministries continue expanding these tools, reflecting possible **vested interests** and **willful ignorance**.

---

## **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

### **Tools Introduced**

1. **Biometric Attendance Systems** (state and central levels)
   Intended to reduce absenteeism.

2. **NMMS App (2022, MoRD)**

   * Twice-daily photograph capture for NREGA attendance.
   * Aimed at stopping wage fraud and inflated muster rolls.

3. **Poshan Tracker with FRT (MoWCD)**

   * Mandatory blinking-photo verification for Take Home Rations.

4. **Aadhaar-Based Biometric Authentication (ABBA) for PDS**

   * Prevent impersonation and leakage.

5. **Geo-tagging and photographic evidence for ANMs**

   * Documenting breastfeeding counselling, home visits, etc.

### **Intended Benefits**

* Transparency, reduced ghost beneficiaries, monitoring field-level functionaries, improvement in efficiency, and cost-saving for welfare schemes.

### **Issues Acknowledged by Government**

* MoRD officially noted **misuse and manipulation** of NMMS.
* Despite this, ministries continue to impose similar systems (e.g., compulsory FRT for THR).

---

## **4. Mains Relevance**

### **a) Issues and Challenges**

#### **1. Limited Impact on Accountability**

* Tech forces presence, not performance.
* Workers can be physically present but may not work meaningfully.
* Fraud shifts form: from forged signatures → staged photographs.

#### **2. Exclusion and Inequality**

* Elderly, disabled, and immobile persons suffer under ABBA.
* NREGA workers unable to upload photos lose wages.
* Connectivity constraints punish sincere workers.

#### **3. Administrative Inefficiency**

* Time spent on photographing, uploading, and troubleshooting reduces time available for actual service delivery.
* Increased burden on frontline workers.

#### **4. Privacy and Ethical Concerns**

* Photographs of breastfeeding mothers, location tracking of ANMs, large biometric data stores.
* Raises concerns under the **Digital Personal Data Protection Act**.

#### **5. Demotivation and Stress for Honest Workers**

* Genuine field workers face penalties due to app errors.
* Creates fear-based work culture.

#### **6. New Corruption Channels**

* Fake photo uploads, misuse of override mechanisms, manipulation of authentication failure claims.

#### **7. Agnotology: Systematic Ignorance**

* Authorities ignore documented failures.
* Shows potential **capture by tech vendors** and the creation of permanent markets for devices, servers, and authentication services.

---

### **b) Impacts on Society, Economy, Governance**

#### **Societal Impact**

* Exclusion of vulnerable populations from welfare benefits.
* Humiliation and erosion of dignity for workers and beneficiaries.

#### **Economic Impact**

* Wastage of public funds on ineffective technologies.
* Increased transaction costs for welfare delivery.

#### **Governance Impact**

* Misplaced faith in technology leads to neglect of structural reforms.
* Overcentralisation and surveillance culture undermine trust.
* Undermines federalism when central mandates override state contexts.

---

### **c) Ethical and Governance Concerns**

* **Consent and privacy violations** in photographing mothers and field workers.
* **Instrumentalization of workers** as data-producing machines.
* **Shift from human-centred welfare to technology-centred governance**.
* Erosion of autonomy and dignity.

---

## **5. Way Forward**

### **1. Reorient from Accountability to Responsibility**

* Strengthen worker motivation, training, work conditions, and social recognition.
* Reward sincerity instead of policing.

### **2. Context-Sensitive Use of Technology**

* Technology **should assist**, not control.
* Use tech as a supportive tool (e.g., digitised records) rather than punitive surveillance.

### **3. Strengthen Administrative Capacity**

* Improve staffing, reduce workload, ensure predictable salaries, and provide resources.
* Focus on decentralised decision-making and community monitoring.

### **4. Adopt Inclusive, Ethical Digital Governance**

* Ensure privacy protections and minimal data capture.
* No mandatory technologies without offline alternatives.

### **5. Social Audits & Community Oversight**

* Revive **social audit mechanisms** in MGNREGA and PDS.
* Community monitoring is more effective and empowering than surveillance apps.

### **6. Evidence-Based Policy Making**

* Conduct independent evaluations and discontinue failed tools.
* Avoid vested interests shaping policy choices.

### **7. Democratic, Transparent Decision-Making**

* Involve workers’ unions, panchayats, and civil society before imposing tech mandates.

---

# **Conclusion**

Tech-fixes in welfare governance often create an illusion of accountability while deepening exclusion, corruption, and worker demotivation. **True accountability requires building responsibility**, strengthening work culture, improving administrative systems, and adopting ethical, context-sensitive technology. As the article argues, India risks entering an era of **agnotology**—deliberate ignorance—if it continues deploying surveillance apps without evaluating their harms.

# Chaos foretold
# **IndiGo’s Aviation Meltdown and Regulatory Lessons**

## **1. Basic Understanding**

### **Flight Duty Time Limitations (FDTL)**

* A globally followed safety framework regulating **pilot duty hours**, rest requirements, and night-time operations.
* Purpose: prevent pilot fatigue — a major risk factor in aviation accidents.
* DGCA’s revised FDTL norms include:

  * Increase in **weekly mandatory rest** from 36 → 48 hours.
  * Cap night landings from **six → two per week**.
  * Reduced flying hours for flights extending into nighttime.
  * Personal leave **not counted** as rest.
* These norms were to be implemented fully by **Nov 1, 2025**.

### **Aviation Market Structure**

* India’s domestic aviation is dominated by two large players — IndiGo and the Tata-owned Air India group — creating a **near-duopoly**.
* In such a concentrated market, disruptions in one large airline create **systemic shocks**.

### **Regulatory Framework**

* **DGCA**: Ensures operational safety, licensing, oversight.
* **Civil Aviation Ministry**: Policy direction, monitoring sectoral stability.
* Passenger rights under **CAR norms** exist but are poorly enforced.

---

## **2. The News**

* IndiGo caused massive nationwide disruptions during the **peak December travel season**, with domestic cancellations running into thousands.
* Human impact included:

  * Stranded defence personnel, senior citizens, medical patients.
  * Family, business, and holiday plans disrupted.
* International flights (high revenue + strict compensation laws) were largely protected — **<10% cancellations**.
* Official explanation cited:

  * Tech issues,
  * Weather,
  * Scheduling changes,
  * Crew rostering complications from FDTL norms.
* **Core mistake**: IndiGo misread DGCA’s phased FDTL implementation plan and over-expanded its winter schedule.
* IndiGo increased flights **14,158 → 15,014**, despite having only **4,551 Airbus flight crew**, causing severe crew shortages.
* DGCA intervened late, imposing:

  * Show-cause notices,
  * Emergency waivers,
  * Fare caps for other airlines to prevent price gouging.
* Parliament also discussed the issue.
* Pilot unions warn DGCA’s temporary waivers **dilute safety**.

---

## **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

### **Immediate Actions**

* DGCA issued directives and show-cause notices to IndiGo.
* Waivers on FDTL granted **as a one-time emergency measure**.
* Ministry monitored cancellations, refunds, baggage handling.
* Fare caps imposed on other airlines to prevent profiteering.

### **Existing Policy Tools**

* **Civil Aviation Requirements (CAR)** on passenger compensation.
* FDTL regulations aligned with *ICAO* and global best practices.
* Slot allocation and schedule approvals by DGCA.

### **Structural Gaps**

* Weak enforcement of passenger rights.
* Insufficient oversight of airline scheduling vis-à-vis pilot availability.
* Lack of contingency planning requirements for airlines.

---

## **4. Mains Relevance**

### **a) Issues and Challenges Highlighted**

#### **1. Over-reliance on One Large Airline**

* IndiGo’s dominance means any internal mismanagement causes nationwide disruptions.
* A hallmark risk of a **duopolistic market**.

#### **2. Regulatory Lapses**

* DGCA failed to catch unrealistic schedule expansion in advance.
* Post-facto action cannot prevent passenger hardship.

#### **3. Pilot Fatigue and Safety Compromise**

* Temporary relaxation of FDTL undermines safety standards.
* Pilot unions warn of burnout and compromised judgement.

#### **4. Weak Passenger Rights Regime**

* Compensation norms seldom enforced.
* India lacks an EU-style strong passenger charter (EU261).

#### **5. Poor Crisis Communication**

* IndiGo’s messaging lacked transparency.
* Passengers left stranded without clear options.

#### **6. Market Structure Risks**

* When a duopoly exists, the collapse or mismanagement of one player **destabilises the entire ecosystem**.

---

### **b) Impact Assessment**

#### **Societal Impact**

* Emotional distress, missed medical treatments, disrupted family events.
* Vulnerable travellers — elderly, disabled, students — worst affected.

#### **Economic Impact**

* Business losses due to missed flights.
* Tourism hit during peak season.
* Additional costs for passengers due to last-minute rebooking.

#### **Governance and Institutional Impact**

* Questions over DGCA’s regulatory independence.
* Need for crisis preparedness and anticipatory oversight.
* Erodes trust in aviation safety norms.

#### **National Security Concern**

* Defence personnel unable to reach postings — a serious operational issue.

---

### **c) Ethical and Governance Dimensions**

* **Profit over passengers**: protecting international revenue while cancelling domestic flights raises ethical concerns.
* **Safety vs convenience**: relaxing FDTL norms places commercial interests above safety.
* **Transparency deficit**: airlines owe honest communication to the public.

---

## **5. Way Forward**

### **1. Strengthen DGCA’s Regulatory Capacity**

* Pre-approval checks of airline schedules against pilot availability.
* Real-time monitoring of crew rostering systems.
* Higher penalties for misleading scheduling.

### **2. Implement a Strong Passenger Rights Charter**

* Mandate EU-style compensation for delays, cancellations, and rerouting.
* Automatic refunds without passenger chasing.

### **3. Enforce FDTL Strictly**

* No dilution of safety norms.
* Adopt global best practices for fatigue management.

### **4. Market Structure Reforms**

* Encourage competition beyond the duopoly.
* Lower entry barriers for new regional airlines.
* Review code-sharing and market concentration trends.

### **5. Improve Airline Crisis Preparedness**

# Swap app mandates for digital literacy
# **Sanchar Saathi Mandate Withdrawal and Constitutional Principles**

## **1. Basic Understanding**

### **Sanchar Saathi App**

* A government platform originally designed to:

  * Track lost/ stolen phones via CEIR (Central Equipment Identity Register).
  * Help users block suspicious SIMs.
  * Report telecom fraud.

### **Government Directive (Now Withdrawn)**

* The Ministry asked all smartphone manufacturers to **preload** the app.
* Users could **not disable or remove** it.
* The app would have privileged access: phone, SMS, contacts, and location — raising **serious privacy and surveillance concerns**.

### **Puttaswamy Judgment (2017) – Privacy Framework**

The Supreme Court established a *three-part test* for any state action that infringes privacy:

1. **Legality** – backed by law.
2. **Necessity** – the action must be necessary for a legitimate state aim.
3. **Proportionality** – the action must be the least intrusive measure available.

The preload directive arguably violated **necessity** and **proportionality**.

---

## **2. The News**

* The government mandated that Sanchar Saathi be preinstalled on **every new smartphone**, non-removable, and with broad permissions.
* Aim: combat cyber fraud, spoofed devices, and anonymous telecom accounts.
* Massive pushback came from:

  * Civil society groups,
  * Digital rights activists,
  * Opposition parties,
  * Cybersecurity researchers.
* Concerns:

  * Expansion of state surveillance powers,
  * Cybersecurity vulnerabilities in a privileged app,
  * Constitutional violations.
* **Government withdrew the directive**, marking a crucial policy reversal.
* Parallel examples cited:

  * Apple’s multi-year refusal to allow TRAI’s DND app because it harvested call/SMS logs.
  * Existing, less intrusive systems like *1909*, DND registry, Sanchar Saathi website, and USSD-based checks are sufficient.

---

## **3. Government Interventions & Policy Landscape**

### **Existing Anti-Fraud Tools**

* **Sanchar Saathi Portal & CEIR** – track devices, block IMEIs.
* **TRAI DND 2.0 App** – report spam calls/SMS.
* **1909 Short Code** – report telecom fraud by SMS/IVRS.
* **RBI Campaigns** – educating users against digital banking fraud.

### **Other State Initiatives**

* **1930 National Helpline** for reporting cyber fraud.
* **Cyber Swachhta Kendra**, CERT-In advisories.
* State-level initiatives:

  * Chhattisgarh’s cybersecurity van,
  * Telangana’s *Fraud Ka Full Stop*,
  * Police-bank partnership workshops in Tamil Nadu and others.

### **Limitations in the Withdrawn Mandate**

* Not backed by explicit legislation → **legality questionable**.
* Not the least intrusive measure → fails **proportionality**.
* Existing tools already perform similar functions → fails **necessity**.

---

## **4. Mains Relevance**

### **a) Issues and Challenges**

#### **1. Surveillance Concerns & Constitutional Violations**

* A permanent, privileged system-level app on all smartphones increases:

  * State’s visibility into private communication,
  * Potential misuse by agencies,
  * Exposure to data breaches or lateral cyberattacks.

#### **2. Cybersecurity Risks**

* Privileged apps become **high-value targets** for hackers.
* If compromised, attackers gain large-scale access to:

  * SMS OTPs,
  * Calls,
  * Device identifiers,
  * Locations.

#### **3. Redundancy & Policy Overreach**

* Less intrusive mechanisms already exist.
* Preloading the app solves no new problem, creates new risks.

#### **4. Behavioural Roots of Cyber Fraud**

* Most scams succeed not because of tech vulnerabilities but because:

  * Users believe fake authority,
  * Panic under pressure,
  * Cannot identify genuine vs scam messages.
* Thus, **digital literacy**, not surveillance, is the real solution.

#### **5. Agnotology & Policy Blindness**

* Echoing the article on welfare tech-fixes:
  Willful ignorance of harms created by technological overreach.
* Blanket mandates treat citizens as subjects, not rights-bearing individuals.

---

### **b) Impact on Society, Economy, Governance**

#### **Society**

* Threatens right to privacy.
* Erodes trust in digital governance.
* Creates fear of hidden state surveillance.

#### **Economy**

* Increases cost of compliance for manufacturers.
* Creates large-scale security liabilities.

#### **Governance**

* Sets dangerous precedent of **executive overreach**.
* Weakens India's credibility in global digital rights debates.

---

### **c) Ethical Concerns**

* Coercive installation violates autonomy.
* Indiscriminate data harvesting contradicts *purpose limitation* principles.
* Risks normalising a surveillance state.

---

## **5. Way Forward**

The article proposes a **three-pillar framework** that respects rights, strengthens security, and reduces reliance on intrusive tech:

### **1. Strengthen Fraud Detection Obligations**

* Telecom companies and banks must:

  * Identify suspicious transactions,
  * Block fraudulent accounts quickly,
  * Improve traceability of SIM ownership and money flows.

### **2. Improve User Reporting and Redress Mechanisms**

* Streamline:

  * 1930 helpline effectiveness,
  * Sanchar Saathi portal responsiveness,
  * Multi-language assistance.
* Build a unified incident-response workflow linking police, banks, and telcos.

### **3. Comprehensive Digital Literacy Mission**

* Continuous and culturally contextual public education:

  * Street plays (as in Chhattisgarh),
  * District events,
  * Radio/TV campaigns like *RBI Kehta Hai*,
  * Cybersafety workshops in banks and schools.
* Teach citizens:

  * To distrust unsolicited links/calls,
  * To report fraud early,
  * To use official helplines and portals.

### Additional Recommendations for Governance

* Align with Puttaswamy principles.
* Conduct privacy impact assessments for any tech mandate.
* Adopt a rights-oriented approach in digital policy-making.

---

# **Conclusion**

The withdrawal of the Sanchar Saathi preload mandate is a reminder that **cybersecurity cannot be pursued at the cost of privacy, proportionality, and constitutional rights**. The real solutions lie not in surveillance apps but in **behavioural change, digital literacy, robust reporting systems, and accountable telecom/financial institutions**. India must shift from a paternalistic “nothing to hide” mindset to a rights-respecting framework of **“what’s appropriate to see”** and **empowering citizens** rather than monitoring them.

# National intelligence grid gains traction as Central agencies, police scour for information
## **1. Basic Understanding**

### **What is NATGRID?**

* **National Intelligence Grid (NATGRID)** is a secure intelligence platform connecting multiple government and private databases to provide **real-time information access** to authorised security agencies.
* Conceptualised after the **26/11 Mumbai attacks (2008)** to prevent intelligence failures and improve inter-agency coordination.
* It aggregates data such as:

  * Driving licences,
  * Passport and Aadhaar details,
  * Immigration and airline data (PNR),
  * Bank and financial transactions,
  * Telecom and social media metadata.

### **Purpose**

* To **“join the dots”** in investigations—tracking terror suspects, organised crime networks, financial crimes, trafficking, cybercrime, etc.
* Reduces dependency on multiple separate requests to banks, telcos, airlines, etc.
* Ensures **speed, integration, and confidentiality**.

### **Access and Governance**

* Initially limited to **10 Central agencies** (IB, RAW, NIA, ED, NCB, FIU, DRI, etc.).
* Now extended to **Superintendent of Police (SP)**-rank officers in States.
* Access is role-specific, logged, and monitored.

---

## **2. The News**

* NATGRID is receiving **around 45,000 data requests per month**, indicating rising reliance by law enforcement.
* It became **operational last year (2023–24)** after years of delays since its proposal in 2009.
* At the recent **DGP conference in Raipur chaired by PM**, agencies were directed to **scale up NATGRID usage**.
* The Union Home Ministry has asked States to **liberally access the platform** for investigations.
* The datasets available include:

  * Driving licence & Aadhaar data,
  * Airline and bank records,
  * Social media account details related to specific topics.
* Officials revealed **practical challenges**:

  * Login process time-consuming,
  * Data retrieval slower than expected despite the promise of “real-time”.
* Over **20.41 lakh cybersecurity incidents** were recorded in India in 2024—context for why secure, centralised intelligence systems are emphasised.
* NATGRID removes the need for FIR registration before seeking information.

---

## **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

### **Strengthening Intelligence Infrastructure**

* Post-2019, under Home Minister Amit Shah, long-standing inter-agency disagreements were resolved.
* NATGRID extended to State police to create an *all-India integrated intelligence ecosystem*.

* India’s rising cybersecurity incidents (20.41 lakh in 2024) create systemic vulnerabilities.

#### **5. Lack of Clear Legal Backing**

* NATGRID currently operates through executive orders, not a dedicated Act — raising constitutional concerns under the **Puttaswamy (privacy) judgment**.

---

### **b) Impacts**

#### **Positive Impacts**

* Faster investigations: terrorism, cybercrime, financial fraud.
* Improved inter-agency coordination.
* Reduced bureaucratic delays in data sharing.

#### **Negative Impacts**

* Risk of profiling and mass surveillance.
* Potential for misuse by individual officers.
* Erosion of citizens’ informational privacy.

---

### **c) Ethical & Governance Dimensions**

* Must balance **national security** with **fundamental rights**.
* Need for:

  * Transparency in access logs,
  * Judicial/independent oversight,
  * Minimisation and purpose limitation principles.

---

## **5. Way Forward**

### **1. Enact a NATGRID Legislation**

* Provide legal basis, safeguards, oversight mechanisms.
* Align with *Digital Personal Data Protection Act* and *Puttaswamy tests*.

### **2. Strengthen Oversight & Accountability**

* Independent audit body for monitoring access logs.
* Mandatory documentation of purpose for each data request.
* Role-based access restrictions.

### **3. Improve System Efficiency**

* Upgrade servers & network capability.
* Reduce login friction.
* Ensure genuine real-time data integration.

### **4. Enhance Training of State Police**

* Sensitisation on:

  * Privacy norms,
  * Cybersecurity protocols,
  * Lawful interception rules.
* Build specialised cyber-intelligence units at district level.

### **5. Cybersecurity Reinforcement**

* Regular vulnerability assessments.
* Penetration testing and encryption enhancement.
* Multi-layered security protocols for database access.

### **6. Focus on Data Minimisation**

* Do not collect more information than necessary.
* Avoid long-term retention unless justified by law and oversight.

---

# **Conclusion**

NATGRID represents India’s ambition to create a **holistic, integrated intelligence architecture** after the failures exposed by the 26/11 attacks. While the system is now receiving tens of thousands of monthly requests, **operational inefficiencies, privacy concerns, and cybersecurity risks** remain major challenges. The long-term credibility and legitimacy of NATGRID will depend on its **legal safeguards, transparency, cyber resilience, and respect for constitutional rights**, not merely technical integration.

# What are concerns over the draft ISI Bill, 2025?
# **The Draft Indian Statistical Institute Bill, 2025: Autonomy, Governance, and Academic Freedom**

## **1. Basic Understanding**

### **What is the ISI?**

* Founded in **1931** by **P.C. Mahalanobis**, ISI is one of India’s oldest and most prestigious academic research institutions.
* Registered originally as a **Society** under the Societies Registration Act, 1860.
* Declared an **Institution of National Importance (INI)** through the **Indian Statistical Institute Act, 1959**.
* ISI has been central to:

  * Birth of the **NSSO** (India’s official statistical system),
  * Development of planning methodologies,
  * World-class research in statistics, mathematics, economics, computer science, and cryptology.
* Alumni include global stalwarts such as **C.R. Rao** and **S.R.S. Varadhan**.

### **What Does “Registered Society” Mean?**

* Autonomy to frame and amend its **memorandum of association, bye-laws, governance structures**.
* Faculty representation in decision-making.
* Academic priorities insulated from day-to-day political interference.

### **What Does “Statutory Body Corporate” Mean?**

* Created and governed entirely by a **central law**, under direct administrative control of the Union government.
* Governance structure determined by statute, not by academic community.
* Possibility of stronger control by government-appointed officials.

---

## **2. The News**

* On **September 25, 2025**, MoSPI released the **draft Indian Statistical Institute Bill, 2025**.
* The Bill proposes to:

  * Repeal the **1959 Act**,
  * Dissolve the existing **Society**,
  * Reconstitute ISI as a **statutory body corporate**,
  * Establish a **Board of Governors (BoG)** dominated by government nominees.

### **Public Reaction**

* **Strong protests** by students, faculty, alumni, and 1,500+ academicians.
* Human chains and public meetings at ISI Kolkata.
* Opposition political parties vow to oppose the Bill.

---

## **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

### **Government’s Rationale for Reform**

* To prepare ISI for its **centenary (2031)**.
* Claims Bill aims to make ISI “one of the foremost global institutes”.
* Four committees reviewed ISI’s functioning; the **Mashelkar Committee (2020)** recommended:

  * Governance reforms,
  * Expansion of programmes,
  * Increased international competitiveness,
  * Modernisation of administrative systems.

### **Key Provisions of the Draft Bill**

* **Section 15:** Establishes the Board of Governors with majority government nominees.
* **Section 29:** Grants ISI power to generate revenue—through student fees, consultancy, sponsored research—reflecting a corporate funding model.
* **Appointments:** Entirely controlled by the Union Government through the BoG.
* **Society dissolved:** No elected academic representation in new governing structures.
