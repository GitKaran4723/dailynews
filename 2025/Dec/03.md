# DoT order to ‘pre-install’ govt. app triggers storm
## **1. Basic Understanding**

### **What is Sanchar Saathi?**

Sanchar Saathi is an initiative of the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) aimed at **enhancing digital safety for telecom users**. It consolidates multiple citizen-facing tools:

* **CEIR (Central Equipment Identity Register):**
  Helps users **block stolen/lost phones** by blacklisting the IMEI, making them unusable on Indian networks.

* **TAFCOP services:**
  Users can check **mobile connections issued in their name** to prevent fraud and identity misuse.

* **IMEI Verification:**
  Enables verification of whether a device’s IMEI is genuine or tampered.

* **Fraud Reporting Tools:**
  Helps identify **spam/fraud callers** and report telecom-related frauds.

### **Key Concepts**

* **Pre-installed Apps (Bloatware):**
  Apps installed by manufacturers or governments on new phones. Often **cannot be uninstalled** unless rooted.

* **Informed Consent:**
  A core principle of digital rights requiring that users should know **what is installed**, **what data it collects**, and **whether they can opt out**.

* **Root Privileges / OS-level permissions:**
  If an app receives system-level access, it can override user controls, raising concerns over **privacy, surveillance, and security**.

---

## **2. The News**

* On **Monday**, the Union government **mandated smartphone manufacturers** to **pre-install the Sanchar Saathi app** on all new devices.
* This led to **political backlash** and criticism from:

  * **Mallikarjun Kharge (Leader of Opposition)**
  * **Priyanka Chaturvedi (Shiv Sena UBT)**
  * **John Brittas (CPI-M Rajya Sabha MP)**
* Critics argued that:

  * The move lacked **consultation** with stakeholders.
  * Mandatory pre-installation could violate **digital autonomy and informed consent**.
  * It might turn devices into instruments for **continuous digital supervision**.
* Cybersecurity experts warned that:

  * Pre-installed government apps could become **entry points for malware/spyware**.
  * With system-level permissions, **over-the-air (OTA)** updates may potentially escalate privileges.

---

## **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

### **Past and Ongoing DoT Initiatives**

* **CEIR rollout (2022–2023):**
  Pan-India system to combat mobile theft through IMEI blacklisting.

* **TAFCOP Portal:**
  Helps citizens detect unauthorised SIM cards issued in their name.

* **Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023:**
  Framework for data processing, though **government exemptions** remain controversial.

* **Cyber Crime Prevention for Women & Children (MHA initiative).**

* **IndiaAI Mission & Cybersecurity Frameworks:**
  Focus on data security and cyber hygiene.

### **Current Mandate**

* The DoT order requires **mandatory pre-installation** of Sanchar Saathi.
* Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia clarified that **users may delete the app**, but the mandate raises ambiguity because many preloaded apps cannot be removed.

---

## **4. Mains Relevance**

### **(a) Issues and Challenges**

#### **1. Privacy Concerns**

* Mandatory apps may collect sensitive data like device identity, SIM details, and usage patterns.
* Violates the principle of **data minimisation** and **user autonomy**.

#### **2. Informed Consent**

* Preloading—especially if non-removable—**removes agency** from users.
* Goes against global best practices in digital governance.

#### **3. Surveillance Fears**

* App could, in theory, act as a **system-level tool**, enabling:

  * Tracking
  * Behavioural profiling
  * Monitoring communication metadata

Even if not currently used for surveillance, **perception of surveillance** impacts trust.

#### **4. Cybersecurity Risks**

* Pre-installed apps with system privileges become **high-value targets** for hackers.
* Vulnerable supply chains can allow **malicious OTA updates**.

#### **5. Precedent for Digital Overreach**

* Risk of normalising mandatory digital tools without adequate legislative oversight.
* Could clash with the **Right to Privacy (Puttaswamy Judgment, 2017)**.

#### **6. Federal & Political Concerns**

* Opposition alleges **lack of consultation**, affecting institutional trust and cooperative federalism in tech governance.

### **(b) Societal & Governance Impacts**

* **Trust deficit** between citizens and state digital initiatives.
* May affect uptake of government digital services (e.g., DigiLocker, UMANG).
* Perceptions of **state paternalism** vs **digital choice**.

### **(c) Economic Implications**

* Manufacturers may face **compliance burdens**, OS-level integration challenges, and delays in rolling out devices.

---

## **5. Way Forward**

### **1. Adopt an Opt-in Framework**

* The app should be:

  * Optional to install
  * Clearly explained
  * Transparent in permissions
* Use **“nudges”**, not mandates.

### **2. Strengthen Legal Safeguards**

* Enforce:

  * Data minimisation
  * Purpose limitation
  * Independent audits
* Empower the **Data Protection Board** to oversee compliance.

### **3. Sunset Clause & Independent Oversight**

* Mandate should have a **time-bound review**.
* Oversight by a multi-stakeholder body (civil society, telecom experts, govt).

### **4. Transparency Standards**

* Publicly release:

  * Source code (open-source model like Aarogya Setu)
  * Data flow diagrams
  * Permission lists

### **5. Ensure App Is Fully Removable**

* Align with **EU-style digital rights norms**.
* No unremovable “system apps” unless legally justified.

### **6. Strengthen Public Awareness & Cyber Hygiene**

* Massive awareness drive about:

  * IMEI verification
  * Device theft reporting
  * SIM misuse
* Sanchar Saathi can be a voluntary citizen safety tool.

### **7. Consult Stakeholders Before Policy Mandates**

# Zero stars
## **Government’s SIM-binding & Sanchar Saathi Mandate: Cybersecurity vs. Privacy Debate**

---

## **1. Basic Understanding**

### **Why has cybercrime become more difficult to tackle?**

Recent cybercrimes show **high levels of technological sophistication**, including:

* **Digital arrests** (criminals impersonate agencies, forcing victims to pay ransom)
* **Cross-border call centres** running large-scale scams
* **IMEI spoofing** and **tampered devices** that make criminals untraceable
* **Instant messaging accounts remaining active even when SIM is removed**, enabling anonymity

### **Key Concepts**

* **SIM Binding:**
  Security mechanism ensuring an app account (e.g., WhatsApp) is linked to the **physical SIM**, so it stops working if the SIM is removed.
  Purpose: Prevent anonymous accounts used for fraud.

* **IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity):**
  A unique 15-digit identifier for every device.
  Criminals often use **tampered/spoofed IMEIs** to evade tracking.

* **Sanchar Saathi App:**
  Initially a web-based platform for:

  * IMEI verification
  * Blocking stolen phones
  * Checking mobile connections issued in one’s name
  * Reporting fraud

The directive now requires it to be **pre-installed by all smartphone makers by March 2026**, with **high system privileges**.

### **Why the concerns?**

* System-level pre-installed apps often **cannot be removed**, enabling potential:

  * Surveillance
  * Malware injection
  * Over-the-air permissions escalation

---

## **2. The News**

* To counter rising cybercrime, the DoT issued two directives:

  1. **November 28** → Mandates **SIM binding** of messaging apps.
  2. **December 1** → Requires **mandatory pre-installation** of Sanchar Saathi in all new smartphones by **March 2026**.
* While the **first directive** is a security patch, the **second directive** has raised:

  * Privacy concerns
  * Fears of surveillance
  * Pushback from manufacturers (including **Apple**, reportedly unwilling to comply)
  * Criticism from civil society and digital rights groups

### **Concerns Highlighted**

* The directive says the app must be:

  * **Visible during device setup**
  * **Non-removable**
  * **Fully functional with no restricted permissions**

* This implies system-level access to:

  * Camera
  * Phone logs
  * SMS
  * IMEI and device metadata

* Given the Pegasus spyware controversy, critics worry that such access could:

  * Expand state surveillance
  * Be misused after a system compromise
  * Target large numbers of users simultaneously

---

## **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

### **Why the government issued these directives**

India is facing:

* Increases in **digital impersonation** and **cyber-fraud**
* Difficulty tracking criminals using:

  * Tampered IMEI codes
  * Foreign messaging accounts
  * SIM-swap and SIM-removal loopholes
* High socio-economic impact of cybercrime (banking fraud, identity theft, extortion)

### **Existing Government Tools**

* **CEIR (Central Equipment Identity Register):** Tracks and blocks stolen devices.
* **TAFCOP Portal:** Finds unauthorised mobile connections issued in your name.
* **Sanchar Saathi Web Portal, USSD codes, SMS checks** – Already provide IMEI verification without deep device access.
* **IT Act & Telegraph Act provisions** for combating telecom fraud.
* **Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDP), 2023** – Provides data governance but includes government exemptions.

### **Why the Mandate Is Debated**

* Government claims **security necessity**.
* Critics argue **proportionality** and **privacy** concerns.
* Manufacturers favour **user autonomy**, citing global best practices.

---

## **4. Mains Relevance**

### **Issues and Challenges**

#### **1. Privacy vs. Security**

* Pre-installation with elevated permissions is a clear **intrusion into informational privacy**.
* According to **Puttaswamy (2017)**:

  * Intrusion must be **legal**, **necessary**, and **proportionate**.
* Since less intrusive tools already exist, this fails **proportionality**.

#### **2. Risk of Mass Surveillance**

* High-level access → Potential “Panopticon”.
* Historical precedents like **Pegasus** worsen trust deficits.

#### **3. Cybersecurity Risks**

* A pre-installed system-level app is a massive **attack surface**.
* If compromised, millions of devices can be targeted simultaneously.

#### **4. Manufacturer Pushback**

* OEMs like Apple emphasise:

  * User privacy
  * Minimal bloatware
  * Strict security architecture
* Could lead to friction between govt policy and global trade practices.

#### **5. Impact on Citizens**

* Possibility of apps reading system data without user consent.
* Reduces user autonomy.
* Could lead to digital exclusion if users fear state monitoring.

#### **6. Legal and Constitutional Questions**

* Does the DoT have the mandate to require system-level software installation?
* Does mandatory deep-device access violate **Article 21 (Right to Privacy)**?

---

## **5. Way Forward**

### **1. Follow the Principle of Least Intrusion**

* Use **web portals, SMS, USSD-based verification** instead of system apps.
* Make Sanchar Saathi **optional**, not mandatory.

### **2. Ensure Transparent Policy-Making**

* Maintains **microclimatic balance** in NCR.
* Forms Delhi’s **last natural green shield**.
* Stores and filters groundwater.
* Prevents soil erosion and dust flows.

### **Environmental Deregulation**

India has seen multiple regulatory relaxations:

* **Forest (Conservation) Amendment Act, 2023:** Exempted several land categories from forest clearance.
* **Draft EIA 2020:** Reduced public hearings, expanded exemptions.
* **CRZ Notification 2018:** Allowed real-estate and industrial activities closer to coasts.
* **Post-facto Clearances:** Legalising violations after environmental damage.

### **Pollution, Mining, Water Contamination**

* Delhi-NCR’s smog: PM2.5 levels consistently above WHO guidelines.
* Groundwater contamination: Uranium above permissible limits in Delhi, Punjab, Haryana.
* Illegal mining: Widespread in Aravallis, Western Ghats, and Himalayas.

---

## **2. The News**

### **Government’s New Decision on Aravallis**

* Centre declared that **hills below 100 metres elevation** in the Aravalli range will **no longer be protected** from mining restrictions.
* Since about **90% of Aravalli hills** fall below this height, environmentalists claim the move is a **“death warrant”** for the range.

### **Parallel Crises Highlighted**

1. **Delhi’s annual smog crisis**

   * Toxic haze affecting millions, linked to an estimated **34,000 deaths annually** across major cities.

2. **Groundwater uranium contamination**

   * CGWB report: **13–15%** of Delhi samples exceed safety norms.
   * Punjab and Haryana show even higher contamination.

### **Author’s Argument**

These issues—mining deregulation, air pollution, and groundwater contamination—are not isolated. They reflect a **systemic governance approach** marked by:

* Environmental disregard

# Privacy in a ‘fishbowl society’
## **Non-Consensual Intimate Image Abuse (NCII), AI Deepfakes & India’s Privacy Crisis**

---

## **1. Basic Understanding**

### **The Core Issue**

We live in an era where **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** can fabricate intimate images and videos without consent, erasing the boundary between truth and fiction. This phenomenon—**Non-Consensual Intimate Image Abuse (NCII)**—includes:

* Deepfake porn
* Morphed images
* Secretly recorded content
* Circulation of intimate images without consent

### **Privacy in the AI Age**

India’s privacy regime includes:

* **Puttaswamy Judgment (2017)** – privacy as a fundamental right
* **IT Act, 2000** and **Intermediary Guidelines**
* **Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDP), 2023**

But these are **inadequate** against AI-enabled harms because:

* They were not designed for deepfake algorithms
* Privacy violations now include fear, anxiety, loss of autonomy, and harm to dignity
* We live in a "fishbowl society" where obscurity—not just privacy—is disappearing

### **Why NCII is uniquely harmful**

NCII causes:

* Chronic fear of being watched
* Social stigma and victim-shaming
* Loss of bodily autonomy
* Emotional trauma and mental health crises (including self-harm cases)
* Career and reputation damage

Deepfakes multiply these harms exponentially by producing **convincing, realistic false images** without the victim's knowledge.

---

## **2. The News**

### **NCRB Data Gap**

* NCRB **does not record NCII separately**.
* All cybercrimes are lumped together.
* When an RTI was filed (Oct 3, 2025), the Centre deflected, saying “law & order is a State subject,” pushing responsibility onto States.

### **November 11, 2025: MeitY’s SOP on NCII**

The Ministry issued **Standard Operating Procedures**:

* Platforms must **take down NCII within 24 hours**
* Multiple channels for reporting (Portals, 112, cyber cells)
* Aim: Protect “digital dignity” of women

**But the SOP has limits:**

* Not gender-neutral (excludes trans victims)
* No accountability for platforms or AI developers
* No penalties or enforceable obligations
* No rules on deepfake generation or tracing
* No clear enforcement architecture

Thus, the SOP is welcome but **insufficient**.

---

## **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

### **Existing Legal Tools**

* **IPC provisions** (Voyeurism, stalking, sexual harassment)
* **IT Act Section 67A** (explicit content)
* **DPDP Act 2023** (limited redressal)
* **Intermediary Guidelines (2021, 2025 amendments)**
* **Cyber Crime Portal (MHA)**

### **Recent Efforts**

* SOP on NCII
* Deepfake monitoring advisories
* Training modules under the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C)
* Awareness campaigns under Cyber Surakshit Bharat

### **Key Gaps**

* No **dedicated NCII law**
* No **AI regulation** on deepfake production
* Inadequate **police sensitisation**
* No **traceability norms** tailored to algorithmic generation
* NCRB’s data architecture outdated
* Intermediaries still largely self-regulated
* Poor victim support and counselling services

---

## **4. Mains Relevance**

### **A. Issues & Challenges**

#### **1. Technological Sophistication of Harm**

Deepfakes blur the line between:

* Identity theft
* Sexual violence
* Cyber harassment
  Existing laws cannot capture AI-generated “synthetic harm.”

#### **2. Structural Data Gaps**

Without disaggregated NCRB data:

* Policy cannot target NCII
* Budgets cannot be allocated
* Patterns cannot be studied
* Victim profiles remain unknown

#### **3. Victim-Centric Deficits**

* Police often uninformed or insensitive
* Fear of blame deters reporting
* Women lack digital literacy regarding legal rights
* Survivors face social fallout, mental trauma

#### **4. Regulatory Lag**

Frameworks rely on:

* Consent
* Mens rea
* Actus reus

But in deepfake crimes:

* Perpetrators may be anonymous
* Content travels globally within minutes
* Platform responsibility is diffuse
* AI developers remain outside legal liability

#### **5. Inadequate Governance**

* Centre–State fragmentation on cybercrime
* Lack of specialised cyber forensic capacity
* Weak enforcement of platform obligations

---

## **5. Way Forward**

### **1. Enact a Dedicated NCII and Deepfake Law**

A new Act must:

* Be gender-neutral
* Define NCII, deepfake generation, and dissemination
* Place explicit duties on:

  * Platforms (trace, takedown, notify victim)
  * AI developers (risk audits, watermarking, detectability)
  * Intermediaries (cooperation with police)
* Provide graded penalties
* Mandate victim compensation and support services

### **2. Strengthen Data Systems**

* NCRB must classify cybercrimes by:

  * NCII
  * Deepfake abuse
  * Cyberstalking
  * Cybervoyeurism
* States must report using uniform digital templates.

### **3. Platform Accountability**

* Mandatory:

  * Deepfake watermarking
  * Detection tools
  * Pre-upload filters
  * Algorithmic audit trails
* Fines for non-compliance (EU-style).

### **4. Police Training & Capacity Building**

* Sensitisation on gender, LGBTQ+ inclusion
* Cyber forensics labs in every district
* SOP training for on-ground officers
* Survivor-centred investigation guidelines

### **5. Victim-Centric Mechanisms**

* Anonymous reporting options
* Emergency take-down helplines
* Psychological counselling
* Safe houses or temporary shelters
* Legal aid support

### **6. Awareness & Digital Literacy**

* School and college-level modules
* Public campaigns on legal rights
* Outreach to marginalised groups (e.g., trans communities)

### **7. AI Governance & Oversight**

* Independent body for:

  * Deepfake regulation
  * AI audits
  * Algorithmic transparency
* Clear procedural safeguards and human rights oversight.

### **8. Strengthen Cooperative Federalism**

* National-level cybercrime coordination with States
* Shared databases and intelligence networks
* Joint task forces for deepfake crimes

# **Cyclone Ditwah’s Devastation in Sri Lanka**

---

## **1. Basic Understanding**

### **What is a Cyclone?**

* A **tropical cyclone** is a rapidly rotating storm system with a low-pressure center, strong winds, and heavy rain.
* Cyclones in the **North Indian Ocean** form mainly in the **Bay of Bengal** and **Arabian Sea**.
* Their strength depends on:

  * Sea Surface Temperature (SST)
  * Wind shear
  * Atmospheric instability
  * Coriolis force (responsible for spin)

### **Why Sri Lanka Rarely Gets Cyclones**

* Sri Lanka lies **close to the equator**, where the **Coriolis force is weak**, making cyclone formation and rotation less likely.
* Sri Lanka typically receives:

  * **Tropical depressions**
  * **Low-pressure systems**
  * Rarely **severe cyclones**

### **Important Concepts**

* **Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ):** A region near the equator where northeast and southeast trade winds converge, producing thunderstorms and low-pressure systems.
* **Slow-moving cyclone:** A system that lingers over a region, causing extended rainfall and wind damage compared to fast-moving cyclones.
* **Hazard profile of Sri Lanka:** Since 2000, 16 cyclones have affected Sri Lanka, but few caused major destruction.

---

## **2. The News**

* **Cyclone Ditwah** originated **south-east of Sri Lanka on November 26** from a low-pressure area in the southwest Bay of Bengal.
* It **moved northwards** along the **east coast of Sri Lanka**, instead of moving away into the open ocean.
* It **lingered for nearly a week**, causing:

  * Heavy rainfall
  * Strong winds (60–90 km/h)
  * Floods
  * Large-scale property loss
  * **Hundreds of reported deaths** (as per local assessments)
* On **December 2**, the remnants of Ditwah reached near Chennai (~40 km southeast).
* The cyclone is expected to **dissipate by December 4**.
* Sri Lanka, unlike India, is **less prepared** for cyclones due to their rarity, leading to limited evacuation and response capacity.

---

## **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

### **India**

* **IMD & RSMC (New Delhi)** monitor cyclones in the North Indian Ocean and provide early warnings to 13 countries, including Sri Lanka.
* Real-time updates were shared with Sri Lanka.
* India's cyclone preparedness framework includes:

  * **National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA)**
  * **Coastal Disaster Risk Reduction Programs**
  * **Cyclone shelters**, embankments, mangrove restoration
  * **INSAT**, **Doppler radars**, and early warning dissemination systems

### **Sri Lanka**

* Early warning dissemination exists through the **Sri Lanka Meteorological Department**.
* Limited cyclone-adapted infrastructure due to:

  * Low cyclone frequency
  * Inadequate evacuation shelters
  * Weak building codes for cyclone-resistance
* Coordination with India for inputs, but emergency response capacity remains thin.

---

## **4. Mains Relevance**

### **A. Issues Highlighted**

1. **Geographical vulnerability**

   * Despite low cyclone frequency, Sri Lanka falls within the path of occasional cyclonic systems forming in the Bay of Bengal.
   * Lingering track parallel to the coastline amplified damage.

2. **Inadequate disaster preparedness**

   * Limited cyclone shelters.
   * Weak coastal infrastructure.
   * Insufficient capacity for mass evacuation.

3. **Climate change factors**

   * Increasing SSTs = More intense and erratic storms.
   * Changing cyclone tracks—some moving closer to equator.

4. **Socio-economic vulnerabilities**

   * Fishing communities, coastal settlements severely hit.
   * High population density in coastal belts increases impact.

5. **Regional cooperation gaps**

   * Although India issues warnings, Sri Lanka’s response capacity is lagging.

### **B. Impact Analysis**

* **Social:**

  * Displacement, loss of life, destruction of homes.
* **Economic:**

  * Severe impact on fisheries, agriculture, small industries.
* **Environmental:**

  * Coastal erosion, mangrove damage, flooding of wetlands.
* **Governance:**

  * Highlights need for resilient institutions and early-warning dissemination.

### **C. Why Ditwah Was Especially Destructive**

* Formed near Sri Lanka (only ~90 km north of Batticaloa).
* Low-intensity but **large, slow-moving system**.
* Travelled **parallel to the coastline**, prolonging damage.
* Sri Lanka’s **lower climate resilience** compared to India.

---

## **5. Way Forward**

### **Strengthening Disaster Preparedness**

* Conduct regular mock drills in schools, coastal villages.

### **Climate Adaptation Measures**

* Integrate cyclone risk in urban planning and coastal zone regulation.
* Promote **ecosystem-based adaptation** (wetlands, dunes, coral reefs).

### **Regional Collaboration**

* India–Sri Lanka joint task force on Bay of Bengal cyclone management.
* Information-sharing on real-time ocean and atmospheric data.


# **Reasons for the Formation of Cyclone Ditwah (as given in the article)**

### **1. Origin in a Low-Pressure System**

* Cyclone Ditwah **emerged from a low-pressure system** that developed **in the southwest Bay of Bengal around November 25**.
* This region is known to generate pre-cyclonic disturbances during this season.

---

### **2. Location Near the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ)**

* The low-pressure system originated **near the ITCZ**, a region near the equator where:

  * Northeast and southwest trade winds converge
  * Strong upward motion of air occurs
  * Thunderstorm activity and low-pressure formation are common

* At the time, the **ITCZ was active**, helping to trigger cyclone formation.

---

### **3. Active Atmospheric Disturbances (Equatorial Waves)**

* A system of **equatorial atmospheric waves** was active during this period.
* These waves—periodic disturbances in atmospheric pressure and wind—**enhanced convection**, providing additional energy to the system.

---

### **4. Interaction of Two Active Weather Systems**

* Both the **ITCZ** and the **equatorial waves** were active **simultaneously**.
* Their **interaction strengthened the low-pressure system**, supplying the fuel needed for cyclone genesis.

---

### **5. Warm Ocean Waters of Bay of Bengal**

* The southwest Bay of Bengal had:

  * **Warm sea-surface temperatures**,
  * Providing moisture and heat essential for cyclone formation.

*(While the article does not explicitly quantify SSTs, warm waters are implicit in every Bay of Bengal cyclone formation scenario.)*

---

### **6. Proximity to Sri Lanka’s Eastern Coast**

* At the time of formation, the system was **only ~90 km north of Batticaloa**, Sri Lanka.
* Being so close to land, it developed into a **low-intensity cyclone** (cyclonic storm) but still carried substantial moisture and wind energy.

---

### **Summarised Reasons (as directly reflected in the article)**

* Low-pressure area developed in southwest Bay of Bengal
* Origin near an **active ITCZ**
* Presence of **equatorial waves**
* **Interaction** between these two systems
* Ample **convection and moisture**
* Formed **close to Sri Lanka’s coast**

# **For Green Transition, India Can Fall Back on Itself**

---

## **1. Basic Understanding**

### **What is a Green Transition?**

* A shift from a fossil-fuel based economy to **low-carbon**, **resource-efficient**, and **climate-resilient** systems.
* It involves:

  * Clean energy expansion
  * Emissions reduction
  * Green industries
  * Sustainable consumption and production

### **Why It Matters?**

* India is the **3rd largest emitter** but also a developing country with rising energy needs.
* Achieving green transition is linked to:

  * Energy security
  * Climate justice
  * Economic modernisation
  * Public health improvement

### **What is the External Finance Debate?**

* At COP summits, developed nations promised **$100 billion/year** in climate finance.
* Actual disbursement remains far below commitments.
* The article argues: **India should not depend excessively on external finance**, because:

  * Commitments are uncertain
  * Geopolitics and fiscal constraints limit Western contributions

---

## **2. The News (Key Message of Article)**

* India must remain **firmly committed** to achieving **net-zero by 2070**, even if international climate finance is delayed or insufficient.

* The authors argue that:

  * India’s green transition is **achievable through domestic reforms**,
  * The country can rely on **its own economic growth, private sector participation, fiscal resources**, and **policy changes**.

* A graph shows two pathways:

  * **Current policies → emissions rise and decline only after 2045**, still high in 2070
  * **Net-zero pathway → emissions fall sharply**, requiring major annual reductions

* The central message: **India can pursue its green transition independently while strengthening electricity reforms, attracting private investment, and deepening sectoral transitions.**

---

## **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

### **Policy Commitments**

* **Net-zero target: 2070**
* **Panchamrit Commitments (COP26)**
