# Cyclone Ditwah weakens; 3 die in rain-related incidents
## **Cyclone Ditwah Weakens Near Tamil Nadu & Puducherry**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

* **Cyclones** are intense low-pressure systems that form over warm ocean waters. In the North Indian Ocean, they are classified into stages—**low pressure → depression → deep depression → cyclonic storm → severe cyclonic storm**, based on wind speed.
* The **Bay of Bengal** is prone to frequent cyclones due to its warm sea surface temperatures, funnel-shaped coastline, and conducive atmospheric conditions.
* Cyclones bring **heavy rain, storm surges, strong winds**, causing flooding, crop destruction, and infrastructure damage.
* **Deep Depression**: When sustained wind speed reduces to **51–62 kmph**, a cyclonic system is classified as a deep depression.

This background helps understand why weakening of Cyclone Ditwah reduces, but does not fully eliminate, risks.

# Centre’s citizenship scrutiny power is ‘limited’, EC says
## **EC vs Opposition on Citizenship Scrutiny During SIR**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

To follow this controversy, it’s important to understand four key concepts:

#### **a) Citizenship Act, 1955 — Section 9**

* Deals with **termination of citizenship** when an Indian **voluntarily acquires foreign citizenship**.
* Only the **Central Government** can determine *when or how* such foreign citizenship was acquired.

#### **b) Electoral Roll & Citizenship**

* Under **Article 326**, only **citizens of India** can be registered as voters.
* **ROPA 1950**, Sections **16** and **19**, make citizenship and ordinary residence mandatory for electoral registration.

Thus, while the Centre exclusively determines *loss* of citizenship in specific cases, other authorities (including EC) routinely verify **citizenship for voter enrolment**.

#### **c) Special Intensive Revision (SIR)**

* A rigorous, legally permitted revision of electoral rolls under **Section 21(3) of ROPA 1950**.
* Involves intense household verification by BLOs.
* Triggered by “felt necessity” (e.g., suspected duplication, migration, inflated rolls).

#### **d) Current Political Allegation**

Some Opposition parties claim that the SIR is essentially a “citizenship screening” exercise or a “de novo NRC”, especially in States like Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and West Bengal.

---

### **2. The News**

* The **Election Commission (EC)**, in a **184-page affidavit**, rejected the Opposition’s argument that only the Centre has authority to scrutinise citizenship.

* **EC’s Key Claim**:

  * Centre’s Section 9 power is **limited** to cases of voluntary foreign citizenship acquisition.
  * All **other aspects** of citizenship verification (for voter list purposes) may be inquired into by **other authorities**, including the EC.

* **Opposition Stand**:

  * The ruling parties in TN, Kerala, WB argue SIR = “citizenship screening”.
  * DMK and others claim the EC is misusing electoral roll revision to mimic NRC.

* **EC’s Rebuttal**:

  * It has constitutional authority under **Articles 324 & 326** to verify citizenship for voter registration.
  * SIR is *not* determining citizenship status — only assessing eligibility to vote.
  * Pre-filled forms require only a **signature**, making the process “voter-friendly”.

* **Legal Basis Highlighted by EC**:

  * **Article 324**: EC’s plenary powers for “superintendence, direction, and control” of elections.
  * **Article 326**: Only citizens can vote → citizenship verification is integral to electoral purity.
  * **ROPA 1950**, Sections **16 & 19**: Non-citizens cannot be enrolled.
  * **Section 21(3)**: Mandates “intense” revision when needed.

* EC asserts that no parliamentary law can override its plenary authority to ensure **purity of electoral rolls**, which EC calls a **Basic Feature** of the Constitution (i.e., essential for free and fair elections).

---

### **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

Although this issue concerns the EC (a constitutional body independent of the government), several legal and institutional frameworks shape the context:

#### **Constitutional & Statutory Framework**

* **Articles 324–327**: Structure election administration.
* **Citizenship Act, 1955** and allied rules.
* **ROPA 1950 & 1951**: Legal basis for electoral roll preparation and disqualification criteria.
* **Basic Structure Doctrine**: Free and fair elections as a constitutional imperative.

#### **Operational Mechanisms**

* **Booth-Level Officers (BLOs)** for door-to-door verification.
* **ERONet** for digitised roll management.
* **SIR Guidelines** issued periodically to ensure accuracy.
* **Regular deletion** of migrated, deceased, duplicate electors to prevent electoral fraud.

#### **Recent Interventions**

* Enhanced coordination with local administration for verification.
* Public consultation and grievance mechanisms for wrongful deletions.
* Extension of SIR deadlines (as covered in an earlier news piece) due to BLO stress.

---

### **4. Mains Relevance**

#### **a) Key Issues & Challenges**

1. **Citizenship Determination vs Electoral Eligibility**

   * Tension between EC’s verification mandate and Centre’s exclusive Section 9 role.

2. **Political Sensitivity**

   * Fear of SIR being used as a de facto NRC.
   * Risk of disenfranchisement of vulnerable groups.

3. **Administrative Burden**

   * Stress on BLOs; uneven digitisation rates across states.

4. **Legal Ambiguity & Overlapping Powers**

   * Extent of EC’s “plenary powers” under Article 324.
   * Limits of parliamentary control under Article 327.

5. **Rights & Accountability**

   * Burden of verification shifting onto citizens?
   * Ensuring procedural fairness and preventing arbitrary deletions.

#### **b) Broader Impacts**

* **Democratic Legitimacy**: Accurate rolls ensure clean elections but overreach may undermine trust.
* **Centre–State Relations**: Opposition-led states increasingly see EC actions as partisan.
* **Citizenship Discourse**: Heated debates on NRC, CAA feed into SIR controversy.
* **Judicial Scrutiny**: Courts may need to clarify boundaries of EC authority.

#### **c) Ethical Dimensions**

* Avoiding discriminatory verification, especially for minorities and migrants.
* Transparency in deletions and appeal mechanisms.
* Proportionality — ensuring verification does not become harassment.

---

### **5. Way Forward**

1. **Clear Delimitation of Powers**

   * A Supreme Court reference or judicial clarification could settle Centre–EC boundaries under Section 9 vs Articles 324/326.

2. **Transparency in SIR Process**

   * Publish detailed SOPs.
   * Mandate multilingual communication to prevent confusion.
   * Provide real-time deletion dashboards and grievance redressal.

3. **Safeguards Against Wrongful Exclusion**

   * Mandatory notice + hearing before deletion.
   * Extend time for objections and inclusion requests.

4. **Strengthen Administrative Capacity**

   * Reduce BLO workload; add digital tools; stagger verification cycles.
   * Ensure psychological and financial support for BLOs.

5. **Legal Reforms**

   * Update ROPA to reflect digital-era needs.
   * Codify safeguards against mass deletion.

6. **Community Outreach**

   * Awareness campaigns in vulnerable districts.
   * Engage civil society, resident welfare groups, and local bodies.

7. **Balance Between Purity and Inclusion**

   * Strive for accurate rolls **without** weaponising verification.
   * Prioritise citizen-centric, not suspicion-centric, approach.
