# Retail inflation moves up marginally to 0.7% in Nov.
## Retail Inflation in India – November 2025 (CPI Analysis)

---

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

**Retail Inflation (CPI)**

* Measures price changes faced by consumers.
* Released by **Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI)**.
* Used by **RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)** to set interest rates.
* CPI composition (approximate):

  * Food & beverages: **~46%**
  * Housing
  * Fuel & light
  * Clothing & footwear
  * Miscellaneous (health, education, transport, etc.)

**Base Effect**

* Inflation is calculated year-on-year.
* If prices were **very high last year**, current inflation may appear **artificially low**.
* This is crucial to understand current inflation trends.

---

### 2. **The News (What happened?)**

* **Retail inflation (CPI) in November 2025**: **0.7%**

  * Slightly higher than **October 2025 (0.25%)**
  * Still the **second-lowest ever** in the current CPI series.
* Inflation has **slowed in 7 of the first 8 months** of FY 2025–26.
* Trend driven mainly by:

  * **Food price contraction**
  * **Strong base effect**

---

### 3. **Component-wise Inflation Trends**

#### (a) **Food & Beverages**

* Prices **contracted by 2.8%** in November 2025.
* Comparison:

  * November 2024: **+8.2%** (high base)
  * October 2025: **–3.7%**
* Key drivers:

  * Sharp fall in prices of:

    * **Potatoes**
    * **Onions**
    * **Tomatoes**
    * **Pulses**
* Food inflation overall fell by **3.9%**.

**Exception within food**

* **Edible oils inflation**: **7.9%**

  * Driven mainly by:

    * Mustard oil
    * Coconut oil

👉 Because food has the **highest weight**, its contraction pulled down headline CPI.

---

#### (b) **Fuel & Light**

* Inflation rose to **2.3%** in November 2025

  * October 2025: **2%**
  * November 2024: **–1.8%**
* Indicates:

  * Mild upward pressure
  * Still not strong enough to offset food deflation

---

#### (c) **Pan, Tobacco & Intoxicants**

* Inflation edged up slightly:

  * **3% (Nov)** vs **2.9% (Oct)**

---

#### (d) **Clothing & Footwear**

* Inflation eased marginally:

  * **1.5% (Nov)** vs **1.7% (Oct)**
* Reflects:

  * Stable demand
  * No major cost-push pressure

---

#### (e) **Housing**

* Inflation almost unchanged:

  * **2.95% (Nov)** vs **2.96% (Oct)**
* Indicates:

  * Stable rental and housing costs
  * No overheating in urban housing inflation

---

### 4. **Why Inflation Remains Very Low (Key Reasons)**

1. **High Base Effect**

   * Food inflation was very high in late 2024.
   * This suppresses current year-on-year inflation.

2. **Vegetable & Pulse Price Decline**

   * Seasonal supply improvement
   * Better market arrivals

3. **Limited Fuel Pass-through**

   * Fuel inflation rising, but still moderate

4. **Muted Demand-side Pressures**

   * Consumption recovery not overheating prices

---

### 5. **Mains Relevance (Analytical Perspective)**

**Positive Aspects**

* Low inflation supports:

  * Household purchasing power
  * Growth-friendly monetary policy
* Gives RBI space to:

  * Pause or cautiously adjust interest rates

**Concerns**

* Inflation is **statistically low**, not structurally low.
* Risks ahead:

  * Base effect will fade in 2026
  * Food prices are volatile
  * Rising fuel or global commodity prices could push inflation up

**Policy Implication**

* RBI must:

  * Focus more on **core inflation**
  * Avoid overreacting to temporary food deflation

👉 Problem:

* Creates a **false equivalence** between speech and violent acts.
* Ignores lived realities of hate-based violence.

---

#### (b) **Punishment Framework**

* No **standalone punishment** clearly defined for hate speech.
* Relies on:

  * **Emotion-based definitions** (hurt feelings, outrage)
* Such definitions have historically led to:

  * Weak enforcement
  * Subjective interpretation

---

#### (c) **Nature of Offence**

* Hate crime classified as:

  * **Cognisable**
  * **Non-bailable**
* However:

  * **Range of punishment unclear**
  * Raises concerns of disproportionality and arbitrariness

---

  * Dilutes seriousness of violent hate crimes
  * Weakens victim justice
* International best practices:

  * Distinguish between:

    * Speech offences
    * Hate-motivated crimes

---

#### B. **Misuse Potential**

* Vague definitions + strong executive powers =

  * Scope for political or selective misuse
* Past experience:

  * Overbroad laws often target dissent rather than hate

---

#### C. **Constitutional Concerns**

* **Article 19(2)** allows restriction only on specific grounds.
* Prior restraint without safeguards:

  * Constitutionally suspect
* Supreme Court jurisprudence:

  * Laws affecting speech must be:

    * Clear
    * Narrowly tailored
    * Proportionate

---

#### D. **Democratic Process & Consultation**

* **Pre-Legislative Consultation Policy, 2014**:

  * Mandates public consultation for impactful laws
* Supreme Court:

  * Emphasised participatory law-making
