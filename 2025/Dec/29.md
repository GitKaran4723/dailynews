### 1. **Basic Understanding**

**What is a landslide?**

* A landslide is the downward movement of soil, rock, or debris under gravity.
* In India, **rainfall-triggered landslides** are the most common type.

**Why are the Western Ghats vulnerable?**

* The **Western Ghats** receive **very high monsoon rainfall**.
* Around **60% of India’s reported landslides** occur here.
* The slopes are mostly made of **residual soils** (formed by weathering of rocks).
* These soils are **highly sensitive to moisture** — small changes in water content reduce soil strength.

**Key technical concept (simplified):**

* **Soil suction**: Dry soil holds particles tightly; when rain enters, suction reduces → soil becomes weak → slope fails.

---

### 2. **The News**

* Researchers at **National Institute of Technology Karnataka (NITK), Surathkal**, have developed a new landslide warning framework called **SVALSA**.
* **SVALSA** stands for **Slope Vulnerability and LandSlide Assessment**.
* It is designed **specifically for the Western Ghats**, unlike generic rainfall-only warning systems.
* The system was developed by **Varun Menon** under **Sreevalsa Kolathayar**.
* It is currently **under patent application**.
* Funded by:

  * **Department of Science and Technology (DST)**
  * **IMPRINT (Impacting Research Innovation and Technology)**
  * **National Technical Textiles Mission (NTTM)**

---

### 3. **Why Existing Systems Are Inadequate**

**Current practice in India:**

* Warnings are mostly based on **rainfall thresholds**:

  * “If X mm rain in Y hours → issue alert”

**Problems with this approach:**

* ❌ Ignores **internal slope conditions**
* ❌ Leads to **false alarms**
* ❌ Misses site-specific failures
* ❌ People lose trust in warnings

**Example:**

* The **July 2024 Wayanad landslide** exposed how rainfall-only alerts failed to prevent loss of life.

---

### 4. **What is New in SVALSA? (Core Innovation)**

SVALSA uses a **multi-parameter, real-time approach**.

#### **Key Components Integrated**

1. **Rainfall analysis**
2. **Soil behaviour monitoring**

   * Moisture content
   * Soil suction
   * Strength changes
3. **Surface deformation**

   * Small ground movements before failure
4. **Machine Learning**

➡️ This mirrors **how landslides actually occur**, not just how much it rains.

---

### 5. **How SVALSA Works (3-Stage Warning Mechanism)**

#### **Stage 1: Rainfall Trigger (Preliminary Alert)**

* Uses historical rainfall + landslide data.
* Machine learning method: **K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN)**.
* Identifies rainfall patterns similar to past landslides.

📌 Purpose: *Early screening*

---

#### **Stage 2: Subsurface Soil Monitoring**

* Sensors track:

  * Soil moisture
  * Pore water pressure
  * Soil suction
* Detects **loss of soil strength** internally.

📌 Purpose: *Understand what’s happening inside the slope*

---

#### **Stage 3: Surface Movement Monitoring**

* Detects **small deformations or creep** on slope surface.
* Confirms imminent failure risk.

📌 Purpose: *Final confirmation before issuing high-level alert*

---

### 6. **Mains Relevance (GS Paper III – Disaster Management)**

**Key issues addressed:**

* Reduces **false alarms**
* Improves **community trust**
* Enables **site-specific warnings**
* Supports **climate change adaptation** (extreme rainfall events increasing)

# A grand vision and the great Indian research deficit
## **India’s R&D Deficit and the Road to Viksit Bharat**
---

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

**What is R&D (Research & Development)?**

* R&D refers to **systematic efforts to create new knowledge, technologies, products, and processes**.
* It is the backbone of:

  * Economic growth
  * Technological sovereignty
  * National security
  * Global competitiveness

**Why R&D matters for India now?**

* India aims to become a **developed nation (Viksit Bharat) by 2047**.
* In the 21st century, **power flows from technology**, not merely population or markets.
* Countries leading in **AI, semiconductors, biotech, green energy** dominate global value chains.

---

### 2. **The Scale of the Problem (Numbers Speak)**

#### **Demography vs Output Mismatch**

* India has **17.5% of the world’s population**
* But contributes only **~3% of global research output**

➡️ This shows **failure to convert demographic dividend into knowledge dividend**.

---

#### **Patent Performance (WIPO Data)**

* According to **World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)**:

  * India ranked **6th globally** in patent filings (2023)
  * **64,480 applications**
  * Growth rate: **+15.7% (highest among top 20 countries)**

**But the hidden weakness:**

* Global patent filings: **3.55 million**
* India’s share: **~1.8%**
* **Resident patents per million people**: **47th rank**

➡️ Growth exists, but **innovation intensity is weak**.

---

#### **R&D Spending Crisis**

**India’s GERD (Gross Expenditure on R&D):**

* **0.6–0.7% of GDP** (stagnant, even declining in relative terms)

**Global comparison:**

* China: ~2.4%
* USA: ~3.5%
* Israel: ~5.4%

---

#### **Huawei Comparison – The Wake-Up Call**

* In 2023, **Huawei** spent:

  * **$23.4 billion** on R&D (single company)

* This is **more than India’s total public + private R&D spending**

* As noted by **Jensen Huang**, Huawei is now only “**nanoseconds behind**” the U.S. in advanced semiconductors.

➡️ **Corporate-led R&D intensity = technological power**

---

### 3. **Structural Problems Behind the Deficit**

#### **(a) Weak Private Sector Participation**

* In advanced economies:

  * **Industry contributes ~65–70% of R&D**
* In India:

  * Government sector: **~63.6%**
  * Private sector: **~36.4%**

**Reasons:**

* Risk-averse business culture
* Preference for **importing/licensing technology**
* Focus on short-term profits, not disruptive innovation

---

#### **(b) Academia–Industry Disconnect**

* Indian universities operate in **silos**

* Research often:

  * Theoretical
  * Publication-oriented
  * Poorly commercialised

* Unlike the U.S.:

  * Indian firms rarely fund university labs
  * Weak technology transfer offices
  * “Valley of Death” between lab and market remains uncrossed

*(This problem was highlighted over a decade ago in a report by N.R. Narayana Murthy, but reforms stalled.)*

---

#### **(c) Brain Drain**

* India produces large numbers of:

  * Engineers
  * PhDs

**But:**

* Top talent migrates due to:

  * Better funding
  * Superior infrastructure
  * Higher salaries
  * Faster career growth

➡️ India becomes a **supplier of talent**, not innovation.

---

#### **(d) Bureaucratic Bottlenecks**

* Slow project approvals
* Delayed fund release
* Fragmented research grants

➡️ Long-term, high-risk research becomes unattractive.

---

### 4. **Government Initiatives**

* **₹1 lakh crore Research, Development and Innovation (RDI) Fund**
* Focus on:

  * Frontier technologies
  * Startups
  * Strategic sectors

📌 Potentially transformative **only if**:

* Disbursal is fast
* Governance is autonomous
* Outcomes are mission-driven

---

### 5. **Mains Relevance (GS Paper III – Science & Technology)**

**Core themes:**

* Innovation-led growth
* Economic sovereignty
* National security
* Global competitiveness

**Challenges highlighted:**

* Underinvestment
* Structural inefficiencies
* Cultural risk aversion
* Talent leakage

**Linkages:**

* Atmanirbhar Bharat
* Make in India
* National Security Doctrine
* Knowledge economy transition

---

### 6. **Way Forward (Strategic Reset)**

#### **1. Scale Up R&D Spending**

* Target: **2% of GDP in 5–7 years**
* Increase private sector share to **≥50%**
* Tools:

  * Tax credits
  * Matching grants
  * Sovereign innovation funds

---

#### **2. Mission-Mode Approach**

Focus on **few, high-impact domains**:

* Semiconductors
* Artificial Intelligence
* Quantum technologies
* Advanced materials
* Green & clean energy

📌 Long-term, uninterrupted funding with clear outcomes.

---

#### **3. Reform Universities**

* Convert universities into **research powerhouses**
* Actions:

  * Strong PhD funding
  * Competitive research faculty salaries
  * World-class labs
  * Industry-sponsored chairs

---

#### **4. Bridge Academia–Industry Gap**

* Mandatory:

  * Joint research centres
  * Co-funded projects
  * University incubators linked to MSMEs & startups

---

#### **5. Build IP Culture**

* Faster patent processing
* Strong enforcement
* Revenue-sharing incentives for inventors
* Rewards for commercialised research

---

### 7. **Conclusion**

India has **brains, ambition, and scale**, but lacks **intensity, coordination, and commitment** in R&D. The comparison with Huawei is not just embarrassing—it is instructive. Without a decisive shift in **investment, culture, and governance**, the dream of **Viksit Bharat** will remain aspirational rather than achievable.

# Gaps in regulating digital campaigns
## **Digital Campaigning & India’s Election Rulebook: The Accountability Gap**
---

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

**How elections have changed**

* Elections are no longer driven only by **parties and candidates**.
* Digital platforms have created an **ecosystem of intermediaries**:

  * Campaign firms
  * Influencers
  * Advocacy groups
  * Surrogate advertisers

**The regulatory mismatch**

* India’s election law still assumes:

  * *Who campaigns* → parties/candidates
  * *Who spends* → parties/candidates
* Reality:

  * *Who persuades* → often **third-party actors**
  * *Who pays* → sometimes **outside the official books**

➡️ This creates an **accountability vacuum** in digital democracy.

---

### 2. **The News / Trigger**

* Ahead of the **Bihar Assembly elections**, the **Election Commission of India (EC)** issued advisories:

  * **October 14**:

    * Mandatory pre-certification of political ads by **MCMC**
    * Disclosure of social media expenditure under **Section 77(1)** of the **Representation of the People Act, 1951**
  * **October 21**:

    * Extended restriction on polling day ads to *“any organisation or individual”*
    * But limited only to **print media** and a **narrow pre-poll window**

➡️ Recognition of change, but **partial and outdated response**.

---

### 3. **Limited Lens of Regulation**

**What remains unchanged**

* Regulation still focuses on:

  * Parties
  * Candidates

**What is ignored**

* Third-party digital actors operating:

  * Outside expenditure ceilings
  * Beyond disclosure norms
  * Without pre-certification obligations

**Two unresolved questions**

1. **Time**: Digital influence builds *months* before polling, not just the last 48 hours
2. **Stakeholders**: Influence now flows through *non-formal actors*

---

### 4. **Evidence from Digital Campaign Data**

Using **Meta Ads Library**, digital political ads in Bihar (30 days before final polling) show:

#### **Who pays?**

* 55 advertisers spent over ₹1 lakh
* Only **23** were official parties/candidates
* **32** were **third-party or surrogate campaigners**

#### **Who persuades more?**

* Third-party actors:

  * Generated **almost double the impressions**
  * With **similar average spending**

➡️ **Communicative power ≠ formal political authority**

---

### 5. **Audience Asymmetry**

* Youth (13–34 years):

  * Consume ~75% of digital political content
* Differences:

  * Party/candidate ads → sharply youth-focused
  * Third-party ads → wider age spread (25–44 & beyond)

➡️ Third-party actors are **strategically better at audience diversification**.

---

### 6. **Efficiency Gap (Why Third Parties Matter More)**

**Impressions per ₹10 lakh spent**

* Parties/candidates: **1.54 crore**
* Third-party actors: **2.60 crore**

➡️ Same money, **unequal reach**

This raises a core democratic question:

> *Where does real electoral influence reside in digital elections?*

---

### 7. **The Unaccountable Nexus**

**Bidirectional financial links**

* Some official party pages ran ads **funded by external entities**
* Example:

  * Ads on **Janata Dal (United)** Meta page sponsored by “The Spectrum”

**Why this matters**

* Third-party spending:

  * May **not appear** in party expenditure statements
* Parties report:

  * What *they spend*
  * Not what *others spend for them*

➡️ **Invisible influence, visible persuasion**

---

### 8. **Legal & Constitutional Gap**

* In **Secretary, Ministry of I&B v. Gemini TV (2004)**:

  * Supreme Court held:

    * No entity may publish ads *for* or *against* a party/candidate
* Logic applies equally to:

  * Digital third-party campaigning

**But in practice**

* Many third-party actors:

  * Continued digital campaigning
  * Even on polling day

➡️ **Norm exists, enforcement does not**

---

### 9. **Delayed & Fragmented Regulation**

**Key weaknesses**

1. **Temporal lag**:

   * Rules activate *after* influence is built
2. **Disclosure opacity**:

   * Digital expenses listed vaguely (e.g., “Facebook”)
3. **Reverse funding**:

   * Third parties paying for party ads → unreported

**Democratic risk**

* Erosion of:

  * Transparency
  * Level playing field
  * Public trust

---

### 10. **Mains Relevance (GS Paper II – Governance & Elections)**

**Core issues**

* Electoral integrity
* Digital democracy
* Campaign finance reform
* Regulatory capacity

**Answer enrichment phrases**

* “Platform-mediated political persuasion”
* “Invisible expenditure, visible influence”
* “Mismatch between law and lived electoral reality”

---

### 11. **Way Forward**

1. **Expand definition of electoral stakeholders**

   * Include third-party advertisers & influencers
2. **Platform-level regulation**

   * Mandatory disclosure of:

     * Ad funders
     * Beneficiary parties
3. **Time-sensitive oversight**

   * Campaign monitoring from:

     * Nomination phase, not just polling eve
4. **Bidirectional disclosure**

   * Parties must report:

     * What *others spend on their behalf*
5. **Unified digital election code**

   * EC + platforms + civil society

---

### 12. **Conclusion**

India’s election law governs a campaign world that no longer exists. As persuasion shifts from party podiums to platform algorithms, democratic accountability must follow influence, not formal labels. Without regulatory resolve, digital elections risk becoming free, fair — and **financially invisible**.

---

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

**What are Rare-Earth Elements (REEs)?**

* A group of **17 metallic elements**:

  * **15 lanthanides**: Lanthanum → Lutetium
  * Plus **Scandium** and **Yttrium**
* In periodic tables:

  * Lanthanides appear as a **separate bottom row**
  * Scandium & Yttrium sit in **Group 3**

**Why are they called “rare”?**

* Not because they are extremely scarce
* But because:

  * They occur in **low concentrations**
  * Are **mixed together** in the same minerals
  * Are **difficult and expensive to separate**

⚠️ **Common confusion**

* REEs ≠ “critical minerals” like lithium, cobalt, gallium
* Those are **strategic**, but **not rare-earths**

---

### 2. **Historical & Technological Context**

**Historical meaning of “earth”**

* Old chemistry term for **oxide powders**
* REEs were first identified as **oxides**, hard to isolate

**Why REEs matter today**
They are essential for:

* **Permanent magnets**
* **Phosphors (lighting, displays)**
* **Lasers & fibre optics**
* **Catalysts**
* **Glass, ceramics, polishing powders**

➡️ Backbone of **electronics, defence, EVs, wind energy, green tech**

---

### 3. **Magnetic Chemistry (Core Science – Simplified)**

#### **Why REEs make powerful magnets**

* REE atoms have electrons in the **4f shell**
* These electrons are:

  * **Highly localised** (close to nucleus)
  * Retain **strong magnetic moments**

**Two requirements of a good permanent magnet**

1. **High magnetisation** → strong magnetic field
2. **High stability** → resists heat & demagnetisation

**Rare-earth magnets have both because:**

* Large 4f magnetic moments → strength
* **Magnetocrystalline anisotropy** → direction “pinned” to crystal

📌 **Example**

* **Neodymium-Iron-Boron (NdFeB) magnets**

  * Used in:

    * EV motors
    * Wind turbines
    * Hard disks
    * Robotics

---

### 4. **REEs as Phosphors & Optical Materials**

* Elements like **Europium, Terbium** → phosphors
* **Neodymium, Erbium** → lasers & fibre optics

**Why REE light is special**

* 4f electrons are **shielded** by outer electrons
* Energy levels are:

  * Stable
  * Sharp
  * Produce **pure colours**, not mixed spectra

➡️ Crucial for **LEDs, screens, optical communication**

---

### 5. **Mining & Processing: Why REEs ≠ Oil**

#### **Mining characteristics**

* Found in:

  * **Bastnäsite**
  * **Monazite**
  * **Ion-adsorption clays**
* Mostly **open-pit mining**
* Environmental issues:

  * Large waste volumes
  * Possible **thorium/uranium radioactivity**
  * High water & chemical use

---

### 6. **Midstream Processing: The Real Bottleneck**

Unlike oil, REEs need **extreme chemical separation**.

#### **Step-by-step value chain**

1. **Beneficiation**

   * Crushing, grinding
   * Physical separation (flotation, magnets)
   * Produces a **concentrate** (still mixed REEs)

2. **Chemical cracking**

   * Acids / bases / heat
   * Break minerals into soluble forms

3. **Leaching**

   * Dissolve REEs into liquid as ions

4. **Solvent extraction (Hardest step)**

   * Uses organic solvents
   * Slight preference for one REE over another
   * Needs **hundreds of repeated stages**
   * Produces **high-purity individual REEs**

5. **Precipitation & calcination**

   * Convert ions → solid → **rare-earth oxides**

6. **Metal production (optional)**

   * Oxide reduced to metal if required

📌 **Key difference from oil**

* Oil: flexible, interchangeable fractions
* REEs: **element-specific, purity-critical**

➡️ If one element is missing, **entire supply chain fails**

---

### 7. **China’s Dominance in REEs**

According to **International Energy Agency** and **U.S. Geological Survey**:

#### **Global reserves (REE-oxide equivalent)**

* **China**: 44 MT
* Brazil: 21 MT
* **India**: 6.9 MT
* Australia: 5.7 MT
* Others: Russia, Vietnam, USA, Greenland

*(Scandium excluded)*

#### **Processing dominance**

* ~**91%** of global REE separation & refining
* ~**94%** of sintered REE permanent magnets

➡️ China controls **midstream**, not just mines

---

### 8. **Recent Developments**

* **Japan** announced (Dec 23):

  * Plans to extract REE-rich mud
  * From **6 km underwater** near Minamitori Island (2026)

➡️ Shows urgency to **diversify supply chains**

---

### 9. **Mains Relevance (GS Paper III – Science, Tech & Security)**

**Why REEs are strategic**

* Energy transition (EVs, wind)
* Defence & aerospace
* Supply chain security
* Geopolitical leverage

**Key challenge**

* Mining alone ≠ security
* **Processing + magnet manufacturing** matter more

**For India**

* Has reserves
* Lacks large-scale refining & magnet ecosystem
* Needs:

  * Public-private partnerships
  * Environmental safeguards
  * Strategic stockpiling

---

### 10. **Way Forward (India & Global)**

1. Build **midstream refining capacity**
2. Invest in **clean separation technologies**
3. Strengthen **REE-magnet manufacturing**
4. Diversify imports & strategic partnerships
5. Circular economy:

   * Recycling from e-waste & magnets
