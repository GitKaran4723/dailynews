# U.S. team to visit India next week to discuss tariffs for bilateral trade agreement
# **India–U.S. Bilateral Trade Agreement: Progress on Tariff Negotiations**

## **1. Basic Understanding**

### **India–U.S. Trade Relations**

* The U.S. is one of India’s largest trading partners, with trade crossing **$190+ billion** in recent years.
* Despite growing economic ties, the relationship faces recurring challenges:

  * Tariffs and counter-tariffs
  * Market access barriers
  * Disputes over digital trade, data, and tech regulation
  * Agriculture and dairy sector sensitivities
  * Renewable energy and industrial subsidies issues
  * Prior withdrawal of India’s **GSP (Generalized System of Preferences)** benefits in 2019.

### **What is Being Negotiated Now?**

* The emerging bilateral trade agreement is structured in **tranches**.
* **First tranche:** focuses **only on tariffs**, not broader structural market access issues.
* Goal: reduce punitive and reciprocal tariffs to normalise trade conditions.

### **Why Are U.S. Tariffs High?**

The U.S. has imposed **50% total tariffs on Indian goods**:

1. **25% reciprocal tariffs** in response to India’s tariff regimes.
2. **25% penalty tariffs** on India for importing discounted Russian oil after the Ukraine war.

This makes Indian exports (steel, aluminium, certain goods) less competitive in the U.S. market.

# Women face greater health risks from rising heat: study
# **Gendered Impacts of Extreme Heat: Findings from the MSSRF Study**

## **1. Basic Understanding**

### **Heat Vulnerability Index (HVI)**

* A composite index that measures the susceptibility of populations to extreme heat based on:

  * Temperature exposure,
  * Socio-economic conditions,
  * Urban/rural context,
  * Access to services (healthcare, water, electricity),
  * Occupation and income levels.

### **Heat Stress & Gender**

* Heat stress triggers:

  * Dehydration, dizziness, fatigue, GI disturbances, and cardiovascular strain.
* Women face **higher vulnerability** due to:

  * Biological factors (reproductive and menstrual health risks),
  * Social norms (unpaid domestic labour, caregiving burdens),
  * Economic marginalisation (informal work, low wages),
  * Restricted access to healthcare.

### **Why Gender-Specific Research is Important**

* Climate policies often treat communities as homogenous, ignoring differentiated impacts.
* Women’s experiences, particularly in the informal sector, are **underrepresented** in climate-health research.

---

## **2. The News**

* MSSRF conducted a study across **seven States**—Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Bihar, Odisha, Telangana, and Tamil Nadu.

* Sample: **3,300 women** across districts classified as high, medium, and low HVI.

* **Key findings**:

  * **70%** of women in high HVI districts reported symptoms during peak heat months—fatigue, dizziness, dehydration, GI discomfort.
  * Women aged **20–45** reported the highest burden.
  * **Reproductive and menstrual problems** widespread: UTIs, irregular bleeding, cycle disruptions.
  * **97%** reported wage losses > ₹1,500 during April–June.
  * **Mental health impacts** severe:

    * Irritability (41%),
    * Anxiety/stress (33%),
    * Sleep disruptions (32%).
  * **Violence** surged:

    * 38% experienced violence at least once in life,
    * 72% saw increase in domestic violence in peak heat months.

* Drivers of psychosocial strain:

  * Overcrowded households,
  * Power outages,
  * Increased domestic labour,
  * Economic pressure.

* Study integrates **NFHS data + IMD heat maps** to prepare district-level vulnerability analysis.

* Next phase: longitudinal studies in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.

---

## **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

### **Climate & Heat Preparedness**

* **National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC)**—missions on adaptation, agriculture, water, urban planning.
* **National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA)** guidelines on heatwave preparedness.
* **State Heat Action Plans (HAPs)** in states like Gujarat, Odisha, Telangana.

### **Health-related Initiatives**

* **National Programme on Climate Change & Human Health (NPCCHH)**:

  * Heat-related illness surveillance,

  * Early warning systems.
* **Poshan Abhiyaan**, **NHM** schemes improve general health resilience.

### **Gender-targeted Schemes**

* **National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM)**: diversification of income sources.
* **MGNREGA**: guidelines for heat protection (water breaks, shade, health monitoring).
* **One Stop Centres**, **Women Helpline (181)**: address violence, though heat-related spikes are under-recognised.

### **Gaps Identified**

* Heat action plans seldom incorporate **gender-sensitive design**.
* Lack of data on heat impacts on menstrual and reproductive health.
* Limited integration of livelihood, health, and climate policies.

---

## **4. Mains Relevance**

### **a) Issues & Challenges**

#### **1. Biological & Reproductive Health Burden**

* Women report higher UTIs, irregular cycles, bleeding disturbances due to dehydration and heat exposure.
* Poor sanitation, limited water access worsen risks.

#### **2. Economic Vulnerability**

* Informal workers face loss of wages, reduced productivity, and heightened precarity.
* Heat reduces working hours → immediate economic loss → psychological stress.

#### **3. Exacerbation of Domestic Burdens**

* Unpaid domestic labour increases during heat (fetching water, cooking, childcare).
* Overcrowding + heat = mental exhaustion, irritability.

#### **4. Mental Health Effects**

* Anxiety, restlessness, insomnia increase significantly.
* Linked to:

  * Power outages,
  * Economic shocks,
  * Reduced coping capacity.

#### **5. Rising Domestic Violence**

* 72% report rise during Apr–Jun:

  * Heat amplifies household tensions,
  * Economic stress is a major trigger,
  * Gender norms restrict women’s mobility and coping mechanisms.

#### **6. Barriers to Healthcare**

* Stigma around menstrual health, lack of awareness, and poor access to medical facilities.

---

### **b) Impacts**

#### **Social Impact**

* Reinforces gender inequality.
* Heightens burden on young women and informal workers.

#### **Economic Impact**

* Wage loss affects household stability.
* Increases intergenerational vulnerability.

#### **Public Health Impact**

* Undiagnosed UTIs, dehydration, psychological disorders create cumulative community-level health risks.

#### **Governance Impact**

* Need for integrating gender concerns into Heat Action Plans (HAPs).
* Highlights weak inter-sectoral coordination.

---

### **c) Ethical & Governance Dimensions**

* Climate justice framework: women least responsible for emissions suffer worst impacts.
* Need for ethical climate policies recognising gendered vulnerabilities.
* Failure to incorporate women’s perspectives undermines equity in climate governance.

---

## **5. Way Forward**

### **1. Gender-sensitive Heat Action Plans**

* Include:

  * Heat shelters for women,
  * Staggered work hours,
  * Access to ORS and hydration stations,
  * Emergency helplines integrated with women’s safety systems.

### **2. Integrate Climate & Health Systems**

  * Physiological impacts,
  * Mental health trajectories,
  * Interventions that work.

### **7. Women-Centric Urban & Rural Planning**

* Shaded public spaces, safe water points, cooling centres.
* Women’s groups integrated in planning committees.

---

# **Conclusion**

The MSSRF study reveals that extreme heat has **deeply gendered impacts**, affecting women’s physical health, mental well-being, economic stability, and safety. Heat stress intersects with poverty, caste, informal labour, and patriarchal norms to produce compounded vulnerabilities. Effective governance now requires **gender-sensitive climate action**, integration of health and social protection systems, and robust research to guide policies as India confronts rising temperatures.

# NGO in Rajasthan targets 38 districts to end child marriage
# **Eliminating Child Marriage in Rajasthan: Community-Led Drive in High-Risk Districts**

## **1. Basic Understanding**

### **What is Child Marriage?**

* Defined legally as:

  * **Girls below 18 years**,
  * **Boys below 21 years**,
    marrying in violation of *The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act (PCMA), 2006*.

### **Why is Child Marriage a Concern?**

* Violates child rights, bodily autonomy, and freedom of choice.
* Leads to:

  * Early pregnancy → maternal mortality, anemia, malnutrition.
  * Intergenerational poverty.
  * Reduced educational attainment.
  * Higher domestic violence and mental-health issues.

### **UN & National Commitments**

* SDG Target **5.3**: Eliminate child marriage by **2030**.

# Rupee at 90: a market meltdown ora calculated policy pivot by RBI?
# **Rupee Breaches ₹90 Per Dollar: Market Pressures, RBI Strategy, and Structural Challenges**

## **1. Basic Understanding**

### **Exchange Rate Basics**

* Exchange rate = price of one currency in terms of another.
* Depreciation of the rupee means **it takes more rupees to buy $1** → rupee loses value.

### **What Drives Rupee Movement?**

Two major forces:

1. **Market dynamics**

   * Trade flows (exports ↓, imports ↑)
   * Capital flows (FPI inflows/outflows)
   * Commodity prices
   * Global interest rates

2. **RBI’s Policy Response**

   * Intervening via buying/selling dollars
   * Managing forex reserves
   * Deciding whether to hold the rupee at a level or let it float

### **Current Context**

* On **December 3, 2025**, the rupee slipped past ₹90 per dollar — a **psychologically significant** but not fundamentally surprising event given recent market pressures.

---

## **2. The News**

* Rupee breached **₹90/$** amid:

  * Declining exports to the U.S. (due to 50% tariff),
  * A massive surge in gold & silver imports,
  * Historic FPI outflows (~$17 billion in 2025).

* RBI has **shifted strategy**:

  * Earlier: aggressively defended the rupee (sold $30–38 billion in 2022–24 quarters).
  * Now: **reduced intervention**, selling just $10.9 billion in Sep 2025 quarter.

* This policy shift — not just market pressure — allowed the rupee to cross ₹90.

---

## **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

### **RBI’s Managed-Float Strategy (Post-2024)**

* **Less firefighting** → let rupee find its market-determined level.
* Aim: use depreciation as a **shock absorber** for export competitiveness.
* Only intervenes to prevent *volatility*, not hold a fixed value.

### **Trade Policy Context**

* India is negotiating with the U.S. to reduce tariffs.
* Government monitoring import surges and external sector stability.
* Macroprudential measures in place to manage capital outflows.

### **Other Policy Supports**

* Focus on domestic inflation stability → helps maintain **Real Exchange Rate** (RER) competitiveness.
* Efforts to diversify export markets beyond the U.S.

---

## **4. Mains Relevance**

### **a) Issues & Challenges Highlighted**

#### **1. Export Decline due to U.S. Tariffs**

* U.S. imposed **50% tariffs** on Indian goods (25% reciprocal + 25% penalty for Russian oil imports).
* Result:

  * Exports to U.S. fell 12% (Sept) and 9% (Oct 2025).
  * New export orders at a **13-month low**.
* Yet, overall exports Apr–Oct grew marginally (+0.5%) due to diversification — but future outlook weak.

#### **2. Surge in Precious Metal Imports**

* Gold imports up **200%**, silver up **528%** in October 2025.
* Driven by:

  * Festive demand,
  * High domestic uncertainty → “flight to safety”.
* This created a **dollar drain**, worsening current account deficit.

#### **3. Massive FPI Outflows**

* FPIs pulled out **$17 billion** — highest in two decades.
* Outflows → heavy selling of rupees → rupee depreciation.

#### **4. Structural Weaknesses**

* Persistent trade imbalance.
* Weak manufacturing PMI.
* Vulnerability to commodity import spikes (energy, bullion).

#### **5. RBI’s Strategic Shift**

* Reduced intervention allowed the rupee to fall.
* Debate: Is this good or harmful?

---

### **b) Impacts**

#### **Economic Impact**

* Depreciation may boost exports *if* inflation remains low — but weak U.S. demand blunts effect.
* Import costs rise → risk of imported inflation (energy, electronics, metal inputs).
* Higher dollar outflow strains forex reserves.

#### **Business Impact**

* Contracts need renegotiation due to currency volatility.
* Firms dependent on imported inputs face cost pressures.

#### **Social Impact**

* Costlier imports may push inflation, affecting household budgets.

#### **Financial Market Impact**

* FPIs leaving → equity market volatility → domestic investors shift to gold → reinforcing rupee weakening.

---

### **c) Ethical & Governance Dimensions**

* Transparency of RBI’s forex operations essential.
* Currency policy affects millions; must balance stability with economic realism.
* Government must manage geopolitical-economic tensions (U.S. tariffs, Russian oil imports).

---

## **5. Way Forward**

### **1. Strengthen Export Competitiveness**

* Expand market diversification beyond U.S.
* Incentivise high-value manufacturing (electronics, machinery, pharma).
* Accelerate FTAs with EU, UK, GCC.

### **2. Manage Precious Metal Imports**

* Raise duties temporarily if necessary.
* Promote digital gold, gold bonds to reduce physical imports.
* Monitor speculative bullion stocking.

### **3. Stabilise Capital Flows**

* Deepen domestic bond markets to reduce reliance on volatile FPIs.
* Provide predictable taxation and regulatory environment.

### **4. Maintain Macro Stability**

* Keep inflation low to ensure **real** exchange-rate competitiveness.
* Improve ease of doing business to retain foreign investors.

### **5. Calibrated RBI Interventions**

* Allow gradual rupee adjustment.
* Intervene only to prevent disruptive volatility.
* Maintain adequate forex reserves buffer.

### **6. Address Structural Issues**

* Boost domestic manufacturing to reduce import-dependence.
* Improve logistics, power supply, infrastructure to support exports.

---

# **Conclusion**

The rupee crossing ₹90 per dollar is not merely a market-driven event; it reflects a **deliberate shift in RBI policy**, combined with external shocks — U.S. tariffs, bullion import surge, and record FPI outflows. Economists differ on whether depreciation will help exports, but all agree that stability, gradual adjustment, and structural reforms are essential. The episode highlights the complex interplay between **global trade tensions, domestic investor behaviour, capital flows, and central bank strategy** in shaping India’s external sector.

# What did Putin’s visit to India achieve?
# **India–Russia Summit 2025: Modest Outcomes Amid Diplomatic Tightrope**

## **1. Basic Understanding**

### **India–Russia Relations**

* Historically rooted in defence, nuclear energy, and strategic cooperation.
* Russia remains a major defence supplier and energy partner.
* Post-Ukraine war, Russia’s global isolation and deepening ties with China have complicated India’s alignment.

### **Diplomatic Context of the Visit**

* Putin’s first visit since:

  * **2022 Ukraine invasion**,
  * **India–Pakistan tensions**,
  * **Downturn in India–U.S. ties** due to tariff disputes.
* Visit occurred during *active U.S.–Russia peace proposals* and heightened Western scrutiny.

### **India’s Strategic Autonomy**

* India aims to balance relations among:

  * Russia (traditional partner),
  * U.S. and Europe (key trade & tech partners),
  * China (security challenge).

---

## **2. The News: Main Takeaways from the Summit**

Despite the **warmest protocol ever** — red-carpet welcome at the tarmac, private dinner at PM’s residence, banquet by the President — **summit outcomes were modest**.

### **a) No Major Defence Announcements**

* Expectations of:

  * Aircraft and air defence deals,
  * Drone and missile technology agreements,
  * New procurement or joint production frameworks
    did not materialise.

* The Rajnath Singh–Belousov meeting ended *without* new defence announcements — likely to avoid provoking U.S./European sanctions (*CAATSA risk*).

### **b) Focus Shifted to Economic Cooperation**

The summit foregrounded a 2030 economic roadmap initiated during Modi’s Moscow visit (2024):

#### **Key Announcements**

1. **Labour Mobility Agreement**

   * Allows Indian skilled workers to take up jobs in Russia.
   * Russia expects shortages of **3 million workers** by decade end.

2. **Urea Plant MoU**

   * Joint venture between Indian and Russian fertilizer companies.
   * Aimed at ensuring stable fertilizer supplies.

3. **Maritime, Port, and Customs Agreements**

   * Focus on logistics and connectivity.

4. **Trade Pathways**

   * Boosting the **Chennai–Vladivostok Eastern Maritime Corridor**.
   * Strengthening the **International North–South Transport Corridor (INSTC)**.

5. **National Currency Settlement**

   * Continued work toward rupee–ruble (or local currency) trade settlement.

#### **What Was Missing**

* **No new agreements** on:

  * Oil procurement (despite forming 85%+ of bilateral trade),
  * Nuclear power cooperation,
  * Space collaboration,
  * Defence-industrial projects.

This signals strategic caution.

---

## **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

### **India’s Objectives**

* Stabilise energy supplies.

* Avoid sanctions jeopardising ties with the West.
* Expand Indian skilled worker mobility.
* Increase trade diversification through new corridors.

### **Russia’s Objectives**

* Secure a long-term market for energy and fertilizers.
* Expand labour force through Indian workers.
* Use India as a window to global markets despite sanctions.

### **Constraints Affecting Agreements**

* **European sanctions** on Russian and Indian oil firms.
* **U.S. 25% penalty tariff** on Indian goods linked to Russian oil imports.
* **CAATSA** risks if major defence deals were announced.
* Western diplomatic pressure (UK/Germany/France joint article).

---

## **4. Mains Relevance**

### **a) Issues & Challenges Highlighted**

#### **1. Russian Oil Purchases Declining**

* Y-o-y intake down **38%** in October 2025 due to sanctions and tariff costs.
* Oil made up **$60 billion** of $69 billion bilateral trade — decline weakens economic ties.

#### **2. Defence Cooperation Under Pressure**

* Announcements avoided to prevent triggering U.S. sanctions.
* Russia’s defence industry weakened by the Ukraine war, limiting India’s options.

#### **3. Western Pressure**

* European envoys publicly advised India—MEA deemed this “unacceptable”.
* U.S. peace proposals underway; India must avoid signalling alignment with Russia.

#### **4. Ukraine War as a Determinant**

* India emphasised being “on the side of peace”.
* Zelenskyy’s silence suggests successful behind-the-scenes diplomacy.

---

### **b) Impacts**

#### **Diplomatic Impact**

* Visit balanced India–Russia friendship **without** alienating Western partners.
* Reinforced India’s role as an autonomous global actor.

#### **Economic Impact**

* Labour mobility and fertilizer projects beneficial but limited.
* No clarity on future oil flows or defence procurement.

#### **Strategic Impact**

* Russia’s growing dependence on China increases India’s strategic concerns.
* India must ensure Russia remains a viable partner without antagonising the West.

---

### **c) Ethical & Governance Dimensions**

* Balancing peace advocacy with pragmatic energy, defence, and diplomatic interests.
* Managing competing moral positions on the Ukraine war while respecting sovereignty and national interest.

---

## **5. Way Forward**

### **1. Continue Strategic Balancing**

* Maintain ties with Russia while deepening cooperation with U.S., EU, and Indo-Pacific partners.
* Avoid actions that could revive CAATSA threats.

### **2. Diversify Energy Sources**

* Reduce vulnerability to sanctions by expanding Middle East, Latin America, and African oil partnerships.
