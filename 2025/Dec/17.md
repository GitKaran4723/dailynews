# Stepping stone
## SHANTI Bill & Expansion of Nuclear Power in India (UPSC-Focused Notes)

---

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

**Status of nuclear power in India**

* Nuclear power contributes **~3% of total electricity generation (2024–25)**.
* India’s energy mix is still dominated by:

  * Coal
  * Renewables (solar, wind)
* Nuclear is valued for:

  * **Base-load power**
  * Low carbon emissions
  * Energy security

**Government’s long-term vision**

* **Target: 100 GW nuclear capacity by 2047**
* Includes:

  * Large nuclear reactors
  * **At least 5 indigenous Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) by 2033**

---

### 2. **The News: What is the SHANTI Bill?**

* **SHANTI Bill** proposes changes in:

  * Who can **build and operate civil nuclear facilities**
  * How **liability, safety, governance and licensing** are handled
* Key shift:

  * From **state monopoly** to **state-controlled private participation**
* It allows the Centre to grant licences to:

  * Government entities
  * Joint ventures
  * **“Any other company” (subject to conditions)**

👉 Intended beneficiaries are **domestic private players**, not foreign plant owners.

---

### 3. **Why is SHANTI Needed? (Context)**

**Capital-intensive nature of nuclear energy**

* Nuclear plants require:

  * Very high upfront capital
  * Long gestation periods
  * High construction risk

**Challenges in achieving 100 GW**

* Public sector alone (NPCIL, BHAVINI):

  * Limited balance sheet
  * Slow project execution
* SHANTI expands the **roster of risk-sharing entities**

---

### 4. **What SHANTI Enables (Key Provisions)**

#### (a) **Private Participation (Limited but Strategic)**

* Private/domestic companies can:

  * Build and operate nuclear power plants
  * Participate in plant delivery and supply chains
* **Sensitive areas remain with the State**:

  * Fuel cycle
  * Nuclear materials
  * Proliferation-sensitive functions

👉 Balances **scale generation needs** with **national security concerns**.

---

#### (b) **Legal & Regulatory Clarity**

* SHANTI places in one statute:

  * Safety norms
  * Enforcement
  * Dispute resolution
  * Terms of participation
* Benefits:

  * Reduces legal ambiguity
  * Lowers transaction costs
  * Shortens site approval and commissioning timelines

---

### 5. **Liability Framework under SHANTI**

#### (a) **Operator Liability**

* Maximum liability for operator:

  * **₹3,000 crore per nuclear incident**

#### (b) **Government Liability**

* Beyond ₹3,000 crore:

  * **Centre bears responsibility**
* Centre may:

  * Assume **full liability** for a non-government installation if in public interest

**Implication**

* Makes investment risk **predictable and insurable**
* Encourages private entry

---

### 6. **Major Concerns & Criticisms**

#### (a) **Adequacy of Liability Cap**

* Question:

  * Is ₹3,000 crore sufficient for:

    * Victim compensation?
    * Long-term environmental remediation?
* Past global experience (Fukushima, Chernobyl):

  * Nuclear damage costs often far exceed caps

---

#### (b) **Insurance & Public Accounting**

* Operators must maintain:

  * Insurance or financial security
* BUT:

  * **Centre’s own nuclear installations are exempt**
* Raises concerns:

  * Transparency
  * Public accounting of risk

---

#### (c) **Supplier Accountability**

* Operator can seek recourse from suppliers only:

  * If explicitly mentioned in written contracts
  * Or if damage is caused with **intent**
* Effect:

  * Supplier liability becomes **contract-dependent**
  * Varies across projects
  * Weakens uniform accountability

---

#### (d) **Regulatory Independence**

* SHANTI creates a statutory framework but:

  * Appointments heavily influenced by:

    * Central government
    * Atomic Energy Commission
* Concerns:

  * Weak regulatory autonomy
  * Reduced public trust
  * Possible investor hesitation

---

### 7. **Mains Relevance (GS-II & GS-III Analysis)**

**GS-III (Energy & Infrastructure)**

* Nuclear energy as part of:

  * Clean energy transition
  * Net-zero commitments
* Role of private capital in strategic sectors

**GS-II (Governance & Institutions)**

* Regulator independence
* State vs market balance
* Risk socialisation vs profit privatisation

**Analytical core**

> SHANTI reflects India’s attempt to reconcile scale, safety and sovereignty in nuclear power expansion.

---

### 8. **Way Forward (Balanced Suggestions)**

* Revisit **liability caps** with:

  * Inflation indexing
  * Environmental damage valuation
* Strengthen **independent nuclear regulator**
* Ensure:

  * Uniform supplier accountability norms
  * Transparent public disclosure for state installations
* Phase private participation with:

  * Pilot projects
  * Strong parliamentary oversight

---

### 9. **Conclusion (UPSC-Ready Line)**

> The SHANTI Bill marks a strategic shift from a state monopoly to a state-anchored, privately assisted nuclear ecosystem, but its success will depend on whether investor confidence, public safety, and regulatory independence are balanced rather than traded off.

# India and the U.S.: 2005 versus 2025
## India–U.S. Relations & the 2025 U.S. National Security Strategy (UPSC-Focused Notes)

---

### 1. **Basic Understanding (Context Setting)**

**What is the U.S. National Security Strategy (NSS)?**

* A core policy document released by the U.S. administration.
* Outlines:

  * Perception of global threats
  * Role of the U.S. in the world
  * Approach towards allies, partners and adversaries
* Reflects **strategic mindset**, not just policies.

**Backdrop: India–U.S. in 2005**

* Period of **strategic optimism**.
* U.S. explicitly stated its intent to *“help India become a major world power in the 21st century.”*
* Led to:

  * Civil Nuclear Agreement
  * Strategic partnership beyond alliances
* Based on belief that:

  * Rising responsible powers strengthen global order.

---

### 2. **The Core Argument of the Article**

The 2025 NSS marks a **decisive shift** in U.S. strategic thinking:

* From **internationalist confidence** → **defensive realism**
* From **partnership-building** → **burden-minimisation**
* From **enabling India’s rise** → **instrumentalising India**

---

### 3. **Key Features of the 2025 NSS**

#### (a) **Tone: Defensive Assertiveness**

* Heavy self-congratulation:

  * Claims of dramatic global turnaround
* Indicates:

  * Strategic anxiety
  * Uncertainty about America’s global role
* Strategy becomes:

  * National reassurance
  * Domestic political messaging
  * Less about managing global complexity

---

#### (b) **Retreat from Global Leadership**

* Explicit declaration:

  * U.S. will no longer “prop up the world order like Atlas”
* Leadership seen as:

  * A cost
  * A burden to be reduced
* Shift from:

  * Shaping the system → managing liabilities

---

#### (c) **India’s Reframing in U.S. Strategy**

* India acknowledged, but:

  * Primarily as part of **China containment**
* Focus on:

  * Indo-Pacific security
  * Quad cooperation
* India is:

  * A **means**, not an **end**
* Contrast:

  * 2005: India’s rise was a strategic objective
  * 2025: India’s role is functional and transactional

---

#### (d) **Inward Turn & Strategic Autonomy (U.S. Style)**

* Trump Corollary to Monroe Doctrine:

  * Assertion of hemispheric exclusivity
* Irony:

  * Earlier, U.S. resisted India’s strategic autonomy
  * Now, U.S. claims unilateral autonomy and calls it realism

---

#### (e) **Performance over Substance**

* NSS claims resolution of multiple global conflicts.
* Appears:

  * Declaratory
  * Politically performative
* Strategy becomes:

  * Narrative construction
  * Not deep engagement with real global fissures

---

### 4. **Implications for India**

#### (a) **End of Strategic Assumptions**

* India can no longer assume:

  * U.S. will actively invest in India’s rise
* Cooperation will be:

  * Conditional
  * Interest-based
  * Issue-specific

---

#### (b) **Burden-Sharing vs Burden-Shifting**

* U.S. calls for partners to:

  * “Assume primary responsibility for their regions”
* In effect:

  * U.S. reduces commitments
  * Partners take on more risks and costs

---

#### (c) **Strategic Autonomy Becomes Central**

* India’s rise must be:

  * Self-driven
  * Capacity-based
* Partnerships are:

  * Tools, not crutches

---

### 5. **Mains Relevance (GS-II: International Relations)**

**Themes involved**

* Shifting nature of great power responsibility
* Transactional alliances vs strategic partnerships
* India’s role in a fragmented global order
* Strategic autonomy vs alignment

**Analytical takeaway**

> The evolution of the U.S. NSS reflects not India’s diminished relevance, but America’s contracting strategic confidence.

---

### 6. **The Path Forward for India**

#### (a) **Recalibrate Expectations**

* Engage the U.S. where interests converge:

  * Technology
  * Defence
  * Indo-Pacific stability
* Avoid dependence on:

  * External strategic sponsorship

---

#### (b) **Strengthen Independent Capacity**

* Economic strength
* Defence indigenisation
* Diplomatic agility
* Institutional depth

---

#### (c) **Craft a Civilisational Role**

* India’s global role must reflect:

  * Scale
  * Pluralism
  * Non-hegemonic leadership
* Not filling vacuums, but:

  * Shaping outcomes selectively

---

### 7. **Conclusion (UPSC-Ready Lines)**

* **Core conclusion**

> The 2025 U.S. National Security Strategy signals a retreat from global confidence to guarded self-interest, compelling India to anchor its rise in internal strength rather than external endorsement.

* **Value-added line**

> If 2005 was an era of shared horizons, 2025 is one of asymmetric expectations — demanding greater Indian responsibility with reduced American commitment.

# The future of governance in post-Maoist India
## Maoist Insurgency & the Missing Governance Lens (UPSC-Focused Notes)

---

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

**What is the Maoist (Left-Wing Extremist) movement?**

* Originated with the **Naxalbari uprising (1967)**.
* Present form concentrated in **central and eastern India** (Red Corridor).
* Predominantly operates in **Fifth Schedule Areas** with large **Adivasi populations**.

**Dominant explanation so far**

* Growth attributed mainly to:

  * Poverty
  * Underdevelopment
  * Socio-economic deprivation
* Resulted in a **two-pronged approach** by the State:

  * Security operations
  * Development schemes

**What is missing?**

* **Governance failure** as an independent and central causal factor.

---

### 2. **Core Argument of the Article**

> Maoism did not grow only because people were poor, but because **governance systems failed to deliver justice, rights, representation and dignity**, especially in Fifth Schedule Areas.

---

### 3. **Fifth Schedule: Vision vs Reality**

#### (a) **Constitutional Vision**

* Fifth Schedule = **new social contract with Adivasis**
* Special features:

  * **Tribal Advisory Council (TAC)** (¾ tribal members)
  * **Tribal Sub-Plan (financial provision)**
  * **Governor’s discretionary powers** to:

    * Prevent land alienation
    * Modify laws in Scheduled Areas

#### (b) **Reality on the Ground**

* Same **colonial administrative structures** continued
* Governance systems:

  * Alien
  * Complex
  * Inaccessible to low-literacy tribal populations
* **Planning Commission Expert Committee (2008)**:

  * Resource-rich region reduced to penury
* **Oxford MPI (2010)**:

  * Region worse than Sub-Saharan Africa

---

### 4. **Land, Forest and Dispossession**

* Despite constitutional protection:

  * Large-scale **land alienation**
  * Displacement due to mining, dams, forests
* **Walter Fernandes**:

  * More tribals lost land **after liberalisation** than any earlier period
* Core grievance:

  * Inability to exercise rights over **Jal, Jungle, Zameen**

---

### 5. **Governance Deficits that Fuelled Maoism**

#### (a) **Administrative Alienation**

* Officials:

  * Overwhelmingly outsiders
  * Insensitive to tribal culture and realities
* B.D. Sharma:

  * Outsiders carried their own biases into governance

#### (b) **Institutional Failure**

* Ministry of Tribal Affairs
* National Commission for Scheduled Tribes
* Governors’ role:

  * Constitutionally empowered
  * **Never actively used discretionary powers**

#### (c) **Weak Service Delivery**

* Poor:

  * Justice
  * Policing
  * Health
  * Education
  * Revenue administration

---

### 6. **PESA: Promise and Betrayal**

**Panchayat Extension to Scheduled Areas Act, 1996**

* Intended to:

  * Enable **self-governance**
  * Empower Gram Sabhas
  * Protect land and resources

**Reality**

* Routine violations:

  * Especially in **land acquisition and mining**
* Expert Committee (2008):

  * PESA flagrantly violated
* Worst violations:

  * **Chhattisgarh** (also most Maoist-affected)

---

### 7. **How Maoists Filled the Governance Vacuum**

* Maoists capitalised on:

  * Trust deficit
  * Justice deficit
  * Administrative oppression
* Offered:

  * Parallel governance (Janatana Sarkar)
  * Speedy “justice” (kangaroo courts)
  * Schools, paramedics, rations
* **Dandakaranya region**:

  * Easily captured in 1990s
  * Mobilised using Jal–Jungle–Zameen narrative

👉 Maoism functioned as a **substitute governance system**, not merely an armed rebellion.

---

### 8. **Recent Improvements (But Incomplete)**

**Positive trends**

* Better:

  * Roads
  * Electricity
  * Telecom
  * Welfare delivery via DBT & digitisation

**Persistent gaps**

* Justice delivery
* Policing reform
* Health & education quality
* Local representation in bureaucracy

---

### 9. **New Threats to Tribal Governance**

#### (a) **Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006**

* Key protective law for forest dwellers
* Today:

  * Diluted by amendments
  * Undermined by administration
  * Weakened by judicial interpretations

#### (b) **CAF Act, 2016**

* Compensatory Afforestation Fund
* Effects:

  * Centralisation of forest control
  * Livelihood loss for forest dwellers
  * Dilution of community rights

#### (c) **PESA Undermined**

* States bypass Gram Sabha consent
* Pressure to unlock minerals
* Self-governance reduced to formality

---

### 10. **Mains Relevance (GS-II & GS-III)**

**GS-II (Governance & Polity)**

* Fifth Schedule
* Decentralisation vs centralisation
* Representation & autonomy

**GS-III (Internal Security)**

* Root causes of LWE
* Governance deficit as security threat
* State legitimacy & trust

**Core analytical line**

> Maoism is as much a crisis of governance legitimacy as it is a security challenge.

---

### 11. **Way Forward: A New Governance Imagination**

#### (a) **Political & Administrative Representation**

* Increase Adivasi presence in:

  * Permanent bureaucracy
  * Police
  * Forest & revenue departments

#### (b) **Revitalise Fifth Schedule**

* Active Governor oversight
* Strengthen TACs
* Real financial autonomy

#### (c) **Strengthen FRA & PESA**

* Protect Gram Sabha consent
* Halt dilution through executive action
* Political commitment from Centre & States

#### (d) **Learn from Sixth Schedule**

* Explore:

  * Autonomous District / Zonal Councils
  * Greater legislative & fiscal powers
* Tailor model to Fifth Schedule realities

---

### 12. **Conclusion (UPSC-Ready Line)**

> The persistence of Maoism exposes a deeper governance failure in India’s Fifth Schedule Areas, where constitutional promises were never translated into lived realities; defeating insurgency therefore requires not just development and security, but a radical reimagining of tribal self-governance.
