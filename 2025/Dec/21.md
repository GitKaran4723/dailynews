# U.S. wants India’s nuclear norms globally aligned
## SHANTI Bill, Nuclear Liability & U.S. NDAA 2026 – Strategic, Legal and Sovereignty Dimensions

---

### 1. Basic Understanding

**What is nuclear liability?**

* Nuclear liability laws decide **who pays compensation** in case of a nuclear accident.
* Key stakeholders:

  * **Operator** (runs the plant)
  * **Supplier** (provides equipment/technology)
  * **State** (ultimate guarantor of public safety)

**Why is this sensitive?**

* Nuclear accidents cause **large-scale, transboundary damage**.
* Liability rules balance:

  * Victim compensation
  * Investment confidence
  * National sovereignty and safety

---

### 2. The News

* Two days after India’s Parliament cleared the **SHANTI Bill**, the **United States Congress** passed, and **Donald Trump** signed, the **National Defense Authorization Act** (NDAA) for FY 2026.
* The NDAA:

  * Advises the **U.S. Secretary of State** to work with India to:

    * Review implementation of the **2008 Indo–U.S. Civil Nuclear Agreement**
    * **Align India’s nuclear liability rules with international norms**
* This is the **first time since at least 2016** that India is explicitly referenced in the NDAA **in the context of nuclear civil liability**.

---

### 3. SHANTI Bill – What Changed?

**Full name**

* Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India (SHANTI) Bill

**Key Provisions**

* Repeals earlier nuclear legislation.
* Allows **private sector participation** in India’s nuclear energy sector.
* Caps **operator liability** for a nuclear incident at **₹3,000 crore**.
* Reduces legal exposure of suppliers.

**Alignment with International Conventions**

* Brings India closer to:

  * **Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage**
  * **Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage**

➡️ This alignment is precisely what the NDAA 2026 encourages.

---

### 4. Background: Why Liability Was a Problem Earlier

* India’s **Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage (CLND) Act, 2010** was unique because:

  * It allowed **supplier liability** (Section 17(b)).
  * This went beyond international norms, where liability rests primarily on the operator.
* Result:

  * U.S. and other foreign suppliers were **reluctant to invest**.
  * The 2008 Indo–U.S. nuclear deal remained commercially stalled.

---

### 5. NDAA 2026 – Why It Matters

**Nature of NDAA**

* Annual U.S. law deciding:

  * Defense spending
  * Strategic priorities
* Not a treaty, but a **policy signal**.

**Key NDAA Directions**

* Establish a **joint consultative mechanism** under the U.S.–India Strategic Security Dialogue.
* Assess India’s compliance with:

  * 2008 nuclear deal
  * International nuclear liability norms

➡️ Indicates U.S. strategic interest in:

* Reviving civil nuclear cooperation
* Opening India’s nuclear market to U.S. firms

---

### 6. Political Controversy in India

**Opposition’s Objections**

* Termed the SHANTI Bill:

  * “Vendor-driven”
  * “Rushed without scrutiny”
* Lok Sabha walkout demanding:

  * Reference to a parliamentary standing committee

**Key Criticism**

* Congress MP **Jairam Ramesh** alleged:

  * Dilution of CLND Act protections
  * SHANTI Bill passed to satisfy U.S. interests

---

### 7. Mains Relevance (GS-II & GS-III)

#### GS-II: Polity, Governance & International Relations

* Parliamentary scrutiny vs executive decision-making
* Sovereignty concerns in aligning domestic laws to global norms
* India–U.S. strategic partnership dynamics

#### GS-III: Science, Technology & Security

* Nuclear energy and energy transition
* Private participation in strategic sectors
* Risk management and disaster compensation

---

### 8. Core Analytical Issues

#### (a) Sovereignty vs Global Integration

* **For alignment**:

  * Attracts investment
  * Revives stalled nuclear cooperation
  * Predictable liability regime
* **Against alignment**:

  * Reduced accountability of suppliers
  * Weaker deterrence against negligence
  * Risk socialised, profits privatised

#### (b) Democratic Process

* Passage without detailed parliamentary scrutiny raises:

  * Questions of transparency
  * Federal and public consultation deficits

#### (c) Strategic Timing

* NDAA reference so soon after SHANTI Bill passage:

  * Strengthens perception of external influence
  * Even if legally coincidental, politically sensitive

---

### 9. Way Forward

* Ensure **robust safety regulation** independent of liability caps.
* Strengthen:

  * Nuclear Safety Regulatory Authority
  * Emergency preparedness and disaster response
* Balance:

  * Investor confidence
  * Victim compensation
  * Parliamentary oversight
* Maintain clarity that:

  * Alignment ≠ surrender of sovereign decision-making

---

### 10. One-Line Conclusion (Interview-Ready)

> The SHANTI Bill reflects India’s attempt to reconcile nuclear expansion with global norms, but its strategic timing and reduced liability protections raise legitimate questions of accountability, process, and sovereignty.

# ‘A weak rupee makes it harder for country to achieve income growth target’
## Rupee at 91 per Dollar – Crisis or Cyclical Correction?

---

### 1. Basic Understanding

**What does “₹91 per USD” mean?**

* It means the **Indian Rupee** has **depreciated** against the **US Dollar**.
* Depreciation = more rupees needed to buy one dollar.

**Why is 91 called a “psychological level”?**

* Such round numbers (70, 80, 90, 100) shape **market expectations**, speculation, and sentiment.
* Breaching them often triggers fears of **runaway depreciation**, even if fundamentals are stable.

---

### 2. The News

* INR breached **₹91/USD**, raising speculation of a slide towards **₹100/USD**.
* Experts are divided:

  * **Ajay Garg (Equirus Capital)** → Calls it a **serious concern**.
  * **Abhishek Bisen (Kotak Mutual Fund)** → Calls it a **temporary, externally driven adjustment**.
* Triggering context:

  * Global trade uncertainty
  * High tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on India (up to **50%**)
  * Global currency realignments

---

### 3. View 1: Why the Weak Rupee Is a Concern

#### (a) Growth & Income Impact

* A weakening rupee:

  * Makes it harder to meet **income growth targets**.
  * Reduces real purchasing power.

#### (b) Capital Flight Risk

* Lower returns for foreign investors once adjusted for currency loss.
* Domestic wealth shifts to:

  * Dollar assets via **Liberalised Remittance Scheme**
  * Gold (non-LRS dollar hedge)

#### (c) Cost of Capital Increases

* Depreciation reduces **effective capital availability**.
* External borrowing becomes costlier.
* Adds pressure to India’s already high capital cost structure.

#### (d) Current Account Deficit (CAD)

* Persistent CAD means:

  * India imports more than it exports.
  * Continuous demand for dollars → rupee pressure.

➡️ **This view sees depreciation as structurally harmful**, not cosmetic.

---

### 4. View 2: Why It Is *Not* a Big Concern

#### (a) External, Not Domestic, Shock

* Depreciation driven by:

  * Tariffs
  * Global volatility
  * Trade disruptions
* Not caused by:

  * Fiscal indiscipline
  * Inflation spikes
  * Banking stress

#### (b) Strong Macroeconomic Fundamentals

India currently has:

* Adequate forex reserves
* Manageable CAD
* Strong GDP growth trajectory

➡️ This suggests **resilience**, not fragility.

---

### 5. Opportunity Angle: Cheaper Indian Assets

* Currency depreciation makes Indian assets cheaper for foreign investors.
* **Indian Government Bonds (IGBs)** effectively become **~6% cheaper** in dollar terms.
* Could attract:

  * Global bond investors
  * Long-term capital inflows

➡️ If depreciation were domestically driven, this optimism would not hold.

---

### 6. Role of Global Trade & Tariffs

* The **Donald Trump** administration imposed **one of the highest tariffs (50%)** on India.
* Impact:

  * Indian exports face stress.
  * Rupee weakens more than peer currencies.
* INR also depreciated against:

  * Euro
  * Yen
  * Pound
  * Swiss Franc

➡️ Confirms **broad-based external pressure**, not India-specific collapse.

---

### 7. Analytical Synthesis (UPSC Perspective)

#### Is rupee depreciation always bad?

* **Not necessarily**.
* Moderate depreciation can:

  * Boost exports
  * Improve competitiveness
* But excessive volatility can:

  * Hurt investment
  * Increase inflation via imports
  * Trigger capital outflows

#### Key Distinction to Make in Answers:

> **Cause matters more than magnitude.**

* External shock → manageable
* Domestic imbalance → dangerous

---

### 8. Mains Relevance

**GS-III (Economy)**

* Exchange rate dynamics
* CAD and capital flows
* Impact of global trade protectionism

**Interview Angle**

* Ask: *“Is rupee at 100 a crisis?”*
* Ideal response:

  * Depends on drivers, not headline numbers.

---

### 9. Way Forward (Balanced View)

* Maintain forex buffer and policy credibility.
* Avoid panic interventions.
* Use depreciation to:

  * Attract long-term capital
  * Strengthen export competitiveness
* Address structural CAD issues:

  * Energy imports
  * Manufacturing depth

---

### 10. One-Line Conclusion (Interview-Ready)

> A weakening rupee is not inherently a crisis; it becomes one only when driven by domestic macroeconomic failure rather than external shocks.

#### Education

* No education → **48%** married before 18
* Higher education → **4%**

#### Wealth

* Lowest wealth quintile → **40%**
* Highest wealth quintile → **8%**

➡️ **Girls’ education is the single most powerful antidote** to child marriage.

---

### 7. Legal and Policy Measures in India

#### (a) Key Laws

* **Prevention of Child Marriage Act, 2006**

  * Halved national child marriage rates.
* **Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012**

  * Acts as a deterrent by criminalising sexual exploitation.

#### (b) Bal Vivah Mukt Bharat Abhiyan

* Portal data (as of Dec 20):

  * **54,917 Child Marriage Prevention Officers** appointed.

  * Focus on education and empowerment.
  * Implementation uneven across States.
* **Laadli-type schemes**

  * Financial incentives from birth.
* School infrastructure:

  * Cycles
  * Toilets
  * Safe transport

---

### 8. Debate on Raising Legal Age of Marriage

* Proposal:

  * Raise women’s marriage age from **18 to 21 years**.
* Rationale:

  * Parity with men
  * Higher education
  * Better health and autonomy

#### Criticism

* Opposition demanded deeper scrutiny.
* Concern:

  * **61% of women (20–24 age group)** married before 21.
  * Mere legal change may:

    * Criminalise communities
    * Push marriages underground
    * Fail without social reform

➡️ Law without legitimacy risks poor compliance.

---

### 9. Mains Relevance

**GS-II (Polity & Governance)**

* Child rights
* Gender justice
* Role of law vs social reform

**GS-I (Society)**

* Patriarchy
* Poverty
* Education and social norms

**GS-IV (Ethics)**

* Dignity
* Autonomy
* State responsibility towards vulnerable groups

---

### 10. Way Forward (Balanced Approach)

* **Social reform first**:

  * Delay marriage through education, not fear of punishment.
* **Strengthen schooling**:

  * Ensure retention of girls till secondary level.
* **Community engagement**:

  * Panchayats, religious leaders, SHGs.
* **Economic empowerment**:

  * Skills, jobs, financial independence for young women.
* **Legal change with safeguards**:

  * Phased implementation
  * Protection from misuse
* **Better monitoring**:

  * District-wise dashboards
  * Outcome-based evaluation

---

### 11. One-Line Conclusion (Interview-Ready)

> Child marriage is less a failure of law and more a reflection of social inequality; lasting change lies in educating girls, empowering families, and transforming norms, not merely raising the legal age.

# Why does the govt. want to replace MGNREGA?
## VB-G RAM G Bill vs MGNREGA – Origins, Philosophy, and Structural Shift

---

### 1. Basic Understanding

**What happened?**

* On **December 18**, Parliament passed the **Viksit Bharat – Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Bill** to replace **Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA)**.
* The Bill was passed amid:

  * Opposition protests
  * Civil society criticism
  * Allegations of **no prior consultation**

**Why is this important?**

* MGNREGA was not just a scheme, but a **rights-based law**.
* The new Bill represents a **philosophical and administrative shift** in how rural employment is guaranteed.

---

### 2. How Did MGNREGA Originate? (Historical Context)

* In **2004**, after the UPA came to power, the **National Advisory Council (NAC)** was formed.
* Key contributors:

  * **Aruna Roy**
  * **Jean Drèze**

**Initial Vision**

* Two rights-based ideas:

  * Right to Information
  * Right to Employment

**August 19, 2004**

* NAC drafted an ambitious **employment guarantee law**.

**Dilution & Pushback**

* Government draft diluted:

  * Universal coverage removed
  * Employment guarantee weakened
  * Restricted to BPL households
* Parliamentary Standing Committee (chaired by **Kalyan Singh**) restored core provisions.
* Civil society mobilisation (Right to Food Campaign) played a key role.

**Outcome**

* **2005**: Act passed
* **2008**: Extended to all districts
* **2009**: Renamed MGNREGA

➡️ **MGNREGA was born through consultation, activism, and parliamentary scrutiny.**

---

### 3. Why Was MGNREGA Unique?

#### (a) Rights-Based & Universal

* Every rural household had a **legal right** to:

  * Demand **100 days of work**
  * Receive unemployment allowance if work was not provided

#### (b) No Targeting

* Not linked to:

  * BPL cards
  * Caste categories
* Anyone willing to do unskilled manual work was eligible.

➡️ This avoided **exclusion errors** from faulty poverty metrics.

---

### 4. Social Impact of MGNREGA

* **12.61 crore active workers**
* **Women’s participation ~58%** (last 5 years)

  * ~45% women were earlier unpaid or only worked on family farms
* **SC/ST participation ~35%**
* Consumption among Dalit & Adivasi households:

  * Increased by **up to 30%** during lean seasons
* **COVID-19 role**:

  * Azim Premji University study (Karnataka):

    * > 60% households said MGNREGA contributed to village development
    * Reduced distress migration

➡️ MGNREGA functioned as a **social shock absorber**.

---

### 5. Why Did the Government Bring a New Bill?

* Government’s stated reasons (per Rural Development Minister **Shivraj Singh Chouhan**):

  * Corruption
  * Fund misuse by States
* Counter-argument:

  * Issues were **implementation-related**, not design flaws.
  * MGNREGA already had:

    * Strong **social audits**
    * End-to-end IT transparency

➡️ Reform vs replacement is the core debate.

---

### 6. Key Differences: MGNREGA vs VB-G RAM G Bill

#### (a) Demand-Driven vs Supply-Driven

| Aspect      | MGNREGA             | VB-G RAM G Bill           |
| ----------- | ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Nature      | Demand-driven       | Supply-driven             |
| Who decides | Workers demand work | Centre allocates work     |
| Coverage    | Universal           | Only notified rural areas |

---

#### (b) Allocation & Federal Balance

* **MGNREGA**

  * Centre paid:

    * 100% wages
    * 75% material costs
  * Effective ratio: **90:10**

* **VB-G RAM G**

  * Funding pattern:

    * **90:10** → NE & Himalayan States
    * **60:40** → Other States

* States’ financial burden increases sharply.

---

#### (c) Centralisation of Power

* **Section 4(5)**:

  * Centre determines **State-wise normative allocation**.
* **Section 5(1)**:

  * Centre notifies **where** the scheme applies.
* Under MGNREGA:

  * Entitlement was **automatic and universal**.

➡️ Shift from **rights-based entitlement** to **administrative discretion**.

---

#### (d) Blackout Period

* New Bill allows:

  * Pausing work during peak agricultural seasons.
* Rationale:

  * Avoid labour shortage for farming.
* Concern:

  * Reduces fallback option during distress periods.

---

### 7. Analytical Significance (UPSC Lens)

#### GS-II (Polity & Governance)

* Federalism and fiscal burden on States
* Rights-based legislation vs scheme-based welfare
* Parliamentary scrutiny and democratic process

#### GS-III (Economy & Social Justice)

* Rural employment as social insurance
* Impact on women, SC/ST, migrants
* Labour market flexibility vs livelihood security

---

### 8. Core Question Emerging

> **Is rural employment a legal right of citizens or a discretionary welfare programme of the State?**

MGNREGA answered: **Right**
VB-G RAM G Bill leans toward: **Scheme**

---

### 9. One-Line Conclusion (Exam / Interview Ready)

> MGNREGA transformed rural employment into a justiciable right through universality and demand-driven design, whereas the VB-G RAM G Bill marks a shift toward a centrally-managed, supply-driven framework that redefines the very nature of employment guarantees.

# Will new Act aid India’s nuclear development?
## SHANTI Act, 2025 – India’s Nuclear Energy Reset

---

### 1. Basic Understanding

**What is SHANTI?**

* **Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India (SHANTI) Act** is a new law governing India’s nuclear sector.
* It **repeals**:

  * **Atomic Energy Act (1962)**
  * **Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act (2010)**

**Why nuclear energy matters to India**

* Clean, base-load energy (low carbon)
* Energy security
* Long-term electricity demand
* Strategic technology domain

---

### 2. Why Is SHANTI Significant?

1. **Private sector entry**

   * Earlier: only **public sector entities** could build and operate nuclear plants.
   * Now: **private companies** can participate.

2. **Foreign investment possible**

   * Liability dilution makes India more attractive to:

     * U.S.
     * French
     * Other global nuclear vendors

3. **Ambitious capacity expansion**

   * Current nuclear capacity: **8.8 GW** (~1.5% of installed capacity)
   * Target: **100 GW by 2047**
   * Expected split:

     * ~54 GW → public sector
     * Remaining → private sector

➡️ SHANTI is meant to **unlock capital and technology** to meet these targets.

---

### 3. Global Context: Why Nuclear Is Heavily Regulated

**Historical reasons for caution**

* Dual-use nature of nuclear technology (energy + weapons).
* Strict control over uranium to prevent diversion to weapons-grade plutonium.

**Major nuclear accidents**

* **Three Mile Island accident**
* **Chernobyl disaster**
* **Fukushima nuclear disaster**

➡️ These disasters shaped the global consensus on **strict liability and immediate compensation**.

---

### 4. Nuclear Liability: Core Principle (Before SHANTI)

* **Operator-first liability**:

  * Victims get **immediate compensation** from the operator.
  * No need to prove fault initially.
* **Right of recourse**:

  * Operator may later recover costs from the supplier *if fault is proven*.

---

### 5. What Changed in SHANTI? (Critical Differences)

#### (a) Supplier Liability Removed

Under the **CLND Act, 2010**, operator could claim recourse if:

1. Explicit contract allowed it
2. Accident caused by **supplier’s faulty equipment**
3. Accident due to deliberate intent

👉 **SHANTI removes clause (2)** and deletes the word *“supplier”*.

**Implication**

* Equipment manufacturers are effectively **shielded from liability**.
* Main obstacle for foreign reactor companies disappears.

---

#### (b) Political Irony

* In 2010:

  * BJP (then Opposition) **supported supplier liability**.
* In 2025:

  * BJP government removed it, citing:

    * “Changing technology”
    * “Changing times”

---

### 6. Does SHANTI Shift Risk onto the Operator?

Yes, through **graded liability caps**:

| Plant Capacity | Operator Liability |
| -------------- | ------------------ |
| > 3,600 MW     | ₹3,000 crore       |
| 1,500–3,600 MW | ₹1,500 crore       |
| 750–1,500 MW   | ₹750 crore         |
| 150–750 MW     | ₹300 crore         |
| < 150 MW       | ₹100 crore         |

**Key points**

* Earlier cap: ₹1,500 crore (+ govt insurance pool up to ₹4,000 crore).
* All existing Indian plants are **≤ 3,000 MW**.
* Government’s argument:

  * Caps are needed to **not scare private players**.
* Criticism:

  * Nuclear accidents often cost **billions of dollars**, far above these limits.

---

### 7. Will SHANTI Help India’s Long-Term Nuclear Vision?

#### (a) Homi Bhabha’s Three-Stage Programme

Vision by **Homi Jehangir Bhabha**:

1. **Stage 1** – Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors

   * Fuel: Natural uranium (U-238)
   * Output: Energy + plutonium

2. **Stage 2** – Fast Breeder Reactors

   * Use plutonium
   * Produce U-233 + more plutonium

3. **Stage 3** – Thorium Cycle

   * Use India’s abundant thorium
   * Self-sustaining nuclear system

---

#### (b) Ground Reality

* India is **still stuck between Stage 1 and 2**.
* Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor:

  * Delayed ~20 years
  * Now expected: **September 2026**

---

### 8. Role of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs)

**Why India is interested**

* Faster deployment
* Lower upfront cost
* Modular construction

**Limitations**

* Require **enriched uranium-235** (India lacks this).
* Do **not advance thorium utilisation**.
* Produce similar nuclear waste as large reactors.
* Lower electricity output per unit.

➡️ SMRs help **electricity generation**, not India’s **strategic thorium goal**.

---

### 9. Mains Relevance (UPSC)

**GS-III (Science & Technology / Energy)**

* Nuclear energy & climate goals
* Public vs private role in strategic sectors
* Nuclear safety and liability regimes

**GS-II (Governance & IR)**

* Sovereignty vs global norms
* Legislative oversight
* Indo-US nuclear cooperation implications

**Ethics & Governance**

* Risk socialisation vs profit privatisation
* Victim compensation vs investor confidence

---

### 10. One-Line Conclusion (Exam / Interview Ready)

> The SHANTI Act seeks to accelerate nuclear capacity by easing liability and inviting private capital, but it does so by shifting risks away from suppliers and potentially diluting victim protection, while doing little to advance India’s long-term thorium-based nuclear vision.

## SHANTI Act – Way Forward (Balanced, UPSC-Ready)

---

### 1. Strengthen Safety & Regulation (Non-Negotiable)

* Create a **truly independent nuclear regulator** by giving statutory autonomy to the **Atomic Energy Regulatory Board**.
* Separate **promotion** of nuclear energy from **regulation** to avoid conflict of interest.
* Mandatory:

  * Periodic safety audits
  * Stress tests (earthquake, flood, cyber threats)
  * Public disclosure of safety ratings (without compromising security)

👉 *Private entry must not mean diluted safety.*

---

### 2. Rebalance Liability Without Scaring Investment

* While supplier liability is removed, **operator liability caps should be periodically reviewed** and indexed to:

  * Inflation
  * International accident cost benchmarks
* Expand the **government-backed nuclear insurance pool** so that:

  * Victims receive realistic compensation
  * Fiscal burden is not abruptly transferred to taxpayers

👉 Risk should be **shared**, not silently socialised.

---

### 3. Victim-Centric Compensation Framework

* Establish a **fast-track nuclear damage claims tribunal**:

  * Time-bound compensation
  * Trauma-informed procedures
* Ensure:

  * Immediate interim relief
  * Long-term health monitoring of affected populations
* Compensation must cover:

  * Health
  * Livelihood loss
  * Environmental damage

👉 Nuclear expansion cannot come at the cost of **human dignity**.

---

### 4. Strategic Use of Private Sector

* Limit private participation initially to:

  * Construction
  * Maintenance
  * Non-core operations
* Retain **State control over fuel cycle** (uranium handling, waste management).
* Gradual scaling based on:

  * Safety record
  * Compliance history

👉 Nuclear energy is not just power generation; it is **strategic infrastructure**.

---

### 5. Do Not Lose Sight of India’s Long-Term Nuclear Vision

* Re-anchor policy to **Homi Jehangir Bhabha’s three-stage programme**.
* Fast-track:

  * Fast Breeder Reactor commissioning
  * Indigenous reactor R&D
* Treat **Small Modular Reactors (SMRs)** as:

  * A short-to-medium term electricity solution
  * **Not a substitute** for thorium-based self-reliance

👉 Electricity today should not derail **energy sovereignty tomorrow**.

---

### 6. Waste Management & Environmental Transparency

* Publish a **national radioactive waste roadmap**:

  * Storage
  * Transport
  * Long-term disposal
* Invest in:

  * Deep geological repositories
  * Advanced reprocessing technologies
* Continuous environmental monitoring around nuclear sites.

👉 Waste is the **hidden cost** of nuclear power.

---

### 7. Democratic & Federal Safeguards

* Mandatory:

  * Parliamentary review after 5 years
  * Standing Committee oversight
* Consult States and local communities **before site selection**.
* Ensure:

  * Prior informed consent
  * Community benefit-sharing (healthcare, infrastructure, jobs)

👉 Nuclear legitimacy flows from **trust**, not only technology.

---

### 8. International Cooperation with Safeguards

* Align with global liability norms **without surrendering policy autonomy**.
* Technology transfer clauses must prioritise:

  * Indigenous manufacturing
  * Skill development
* Avoid permanent dependence on enriched uranium imports.

👉 Cooperation must build **capacity**, not dependency.
