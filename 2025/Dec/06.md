### **1. Basic Understanding**

#### **What is the Repo Rate?**

* The **repo rate** is the interest rate at which the RBI lends short-term funds to commercial banks.
* It is the main tool of **monetary policy** used to manage inflation and liquidity in the economy.

#### **What is the MPC?**

* The **Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)** is a 6-member body that decides India’s monetary policy.
* Its objective: keep inflation at **4%**, with a tolerance band of **2%–6%**.

#### **Why Repo Rate Is Cut?**

* When inflation is **below the target**, RBI may reduce the repo rate to:

  * Encourage borrowing
  * Boost consumption and investment
  * Increase economic activity

#### **Key Terms**

* **Basis Points (bps):** 1 bps = 0.01%. So 25 bps = 0.25%.
* **Real GDP Growth:** Growth adjusted for inflation.
* **LAF (Liquidity Adjustment Facility):** RBI’s framework to manage day-to-day liquidity.
* **Standing Deposit Facility (SDF):** Rate at which banks park money with RBI without collateral.

---

### **2. The News**

* The **Monetary Policy Committee** reduced the **repo rate by 25 bps**, bringing it down to **5.25%**.
* Inflation has fallen sharply to **1.7%**, below the lower band (2%) of the inflation target.
* GDP growth is strong at **8.2% in Q2**, showing robust economic momentum.
* Since Governor **Sanjay Malhotra** took charge on **11 December 2024**, MPC has cut rates **four times**, totalling **125 bps**.
* The SDF rate under LAF is now adjusted to **5%**.
* Rate cut implies **lower interest rates for borrowers** (cheap loans) but **lower returns for savers**.

---

### **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

#### **Monetary Policy Framework (MPF)**

* Adopted in **2016**, it legally mandates inflation targeting of 4% ±2%.
* Ensures accountability of RBI in maintaining price stability.

# A growing shadow over digital constitutionalism
## **Digital Constitutionalism & the Sanchar Saathi Rollback**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

#### **What Happened?**

The central government withdrew its mandate requiring mobile manufacturers to **pre-install the Sanchar Saathi app** from 2026. The decision was reversed within **48 hours** due to concerns around:

* Ambiguous data collection
* Lack of informed consent
* Unlimited data storage
* Surveillance risks
* Regulatory overreach

Apple openly refused compliance, and major stakeholders voiced objections. The pushback led to a wider public debate about **digital rights, state power, and citizen privacy**.

#### **Why Was the App Proposed Initially?**

* As a **safety measure** amid rising cybercrimes—from *15.9 lakh (2023) to 20.4 lakh (2024)*.
* To help track lost/stolen phones and assist law enforcement.

---

### **What is Digital Constitutionalism?**

A framework that extends constitutional values into the digital world. It aims to ensure that digital governance respects **liberty, equality, non-arbitrariness, accountability and the rule of law**.

It becomes essential because:

* Governance today is **data-driven and algorithmic**.
* Technologies like biometrics, AI surveillance, predictive policing, and automated welfare systems operate **without transparency**.
* Power gets concentrated in state agencies, private platforms, and algorithm designers.

Digital constitutionalism seeks to **protect citizens from invisible, pervasive, and unregulated digital power**.

---

### **2. The News**

* The Union government **revoked its order** to phone makers mandating installation of the **Sanchar Saathi app**.
* Rollback happened after **widespread privacy and surveillance concerns** and refusal from companies (notably Apple).
* Reuters broke the story; international backlash and economic considerations played a role—India cannot afford to strain its relationship with major investors.
* The event triggered public debate on **surveillance, data misuse, and unchecked digital governance** in India.
* The controversy is now being seen as a **case study in the need for digital constitutionalism**.

---

### **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

#### **Existing Framework**

* **Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (2017)** judgment: Right to privacy is a fundamental right.
* **Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDP), 2023**: Supposed to protect user data, but:

  * Grants **broad exemptions** to the government
  * Lacks strong independent oversight
  * Provides weak remedies for citizens

#### **Regulatory Laws in Place**

* **IT Act, 2000** (outdated for algorithmic age).
* **Intermediary Guidelines Rules (2021)**—control over social media platforms.
* **Aadhaar Act**, KYC rules, national databases.

#### **Gaps Identified**

* No comprehensive law on **state surveillance**.
* No independent oversight body for:

  * High-risk AI systems
  * Facial recognition
  * Algorithmic welfare distribution
* Lack of transparency and accountability mechanisms.
* Citizens have limited recourse when algorithmic decisions go wrong.

# Deal without peace
## **Congo–Rwanda Conflict & U.S.-Brokered Peace Deal**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

#### **Background of the Conflict**

* The roots of the Congo crisis go back to the **1994 Rwandan genocide**, where ~8,00,000 Tutsis were killed by Hutu extremists.
* After the genocide:

  * Thousands of **Hutu militias fled to eastern Congo (then Zaire)**.
  * Rwanda claims these militias (especially FDLR) still operate from Congo and threaten its security.
* **Tutsi communities in Congo**, feeling vulnerable, became the centre of local tensions.

#### **Who is M23?**

* **M23** is a Tutsi-led rebel group in eastern Congo.
* The name comes from the **23 March 2009 peace deal**, which the rebels say the Congolese government failed to implement.
* M23 claims to defend the rights of Tutsi minorities in Congo.
* Congo and UN experts allege that **Rwanda supports M23 militarily**.

#### **Why is Eastern Congo so Conflict-Prone?**

* Presence of **over 100 armed groups**, many operating across porous borders.
* Rich mineral deposits (gold, coltan, cobalt, rare earths) attract armed groups, foreign interests, and criminal networks.
* Weak state capacity and fragile governance in Congo.
* Persistent ethnic tensions between Hutus and Tutsis.

* **African Union** — supports political dialogue.
* **EAC & SADC** — have deployed regional forces at various times.

#### **Diplomatic Efforts**

* U.S.-brokered Congo–Rwanda deal.
* Qatar-facilitated talks between **M23 and Kinshasa**.

---

### **4. Mains Relevance**

#### **Core Issues**

1. **Ethnic Tensions Rooted in Genocide**

   * Hutu–Tutsi hostility remains unresolved since 1994.
   * Refugee and militia spillover destabilises Congo.

2. **External Interference & Proxy Conflict**

   * Mineral wealth incentivises foreign intervention.

3. **Weak Governance in Congo**

   * Limited control of the eastern region by Kinshasa.
   * Presence of multiple militias and criminal networks.

4. **Humanitarian Crisis**

   * Massive displacement
   * Atrocities against civilians
   * Chronic underdevelopment

5. **Premature Peace Claims**

   * Trump’s declaration of ending the war is unrealistic.
   * M23 still controls territories and refuses withdrawal.

6. **Geopolitical Stakes**

   * Congo holds strategic minerals (cobalt, coltan, rare earths) vital for global supply chains.
   * External actors (U.S., China, Rwanda, Uganda) have vested interests.

#### **Impact of the Conflict**

* **Political:** Weakens state legitimacy in Congo.
* **Economic:** Disrupts mining supply chains; fuels illegal resource extraction.

# Chile’s lesson for India’s coal conundrum
## **India’s Coal Conundrum & Lessons from Chile’s Energy Transition**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

#### **Why Did India Drop in the Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI)?**

* India fell **13 places to 23rd** in CCPI 2025 despite progress in renewables.
* Main reason: **No significant progress in coal phaseout**, which continues to dominate electricity generation.

#### **India’s Energy Mix**

* Coal: Over **50% of total energy use** and **75% of electricity generation** (2024).
* Renewables:

  * **50% of installed power capacity** but only **~20% of electricity generation**.
  * Clean energy capacity **doubled between 2021–25**.

#### **Why Coal Is a Difficult Problem?**

* Provides **low-cost power** to many States.
* Supports **large employment** in coal-rich regions (Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, West Bengal).
* Sudden shutdown → **social disruption**, job loss, and economic instability.

Yet, continuing coal has high costs:

* **Air pollution**, climate damages, rising health burden.
* **Projected 3–10% GDP loss by 2100** from heat stress alone.
* A **1 GW coal plant → 14% increase in infant mortality** in nearby districts.

Thus, India faces a **development–environment trade-off**.

---

### **2. The News**

* India slipped in the **Climate Change Performance Index** primarily due to slow coal phaseout.
* While renewable energy grew rapidly, **coal expansion** continues.
* Chile's experience is presented as a comparative model demonstrating how coal-dependent countries can transition faster.
* Chile cut coal’s share from **43.6% to 17.5%** (2016–24) while boosting renewables to **60%+** of its electricity mix.
* Chile’s success was driven by:

  * Carbon tax
  * Tight emissions standards
  * Competitive solar/wind auctions
  * Grid-scale storage systems
  * Clear coal phaseout commitment by 2040
  * Reskilling of displaced workers
* India, however, has:

  * **Much deeper coal dependence**
  * Larger workforce tied to coal
  * Fewer alternative industries in coal districts
* Despite difficulties, coal phaseout is a **“no regrets policy”**—economically, environmentally, and socially beneficial in the long term.

---

### **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

#### **Renewable Energy Push**

* **National Solar Mission**
* **Wind Energy Mission**
* **Green Hydrogen Mission (2023)**
* **PM-KUSUM**, Rooftop Solar Programme
* **Transmission network expansion** under GEC (Green Energy Corridor)

# India, Russia agree to boost trade in national currencies
## **India–Russia National Currency Trade Settlement Initiative**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

#### **What is Bilateral Trade Settlement in National Currencies?**

It means that instead of using the **U.S. dollar** or other foreign currencies, two countries settle trade payments in their **own currencies** — rupees and rubles in this case.

#### **Why Do Countries Do This?**

* Reduce dependence on the dollar
* Lower transaction costs
* Avoid sanctions-related disruptions
* Improve trade resilience
* Strengthen financial sovereignty

For India and Russia, this mechanism has become especially important after Western sanctions on Russia complicated dollar-based payments.

#### **Key Financial Concepts Involved**

* **National Payment Systems** – domestic systems like UPI (India) and MIR (Russia).
* **Financial Messaging Systems** – alternatives to SWIFT like India’s SFMS and Russia’s SPFS.
* **CBDCs** – central bank digital currencies (e.g., Digital Rupee and Digital Ruble) may enable faster, secure cross-border settlement.
* **Trade Deficit** – India imports far more from Russia (mainly crude oil, fertilizers) than it exports, leading to a widening deficit.

---

### **2. The News**

* At the **23rd India–Russia Annual Summit**, PM Narendra Modi and President Vladimir Putin reaffirmed their commitment to:

  * **Enhancing bilateral trade settlement in national currencies (Rupee–Ruble).**
  * Improving interoperability between:

    * National payment systems
    * Financial messaging networks
    * Central Bank Digital Currency platforms

* The goal is to ensure **uninterrupted bilateral trade** despite global financial pressures and sanctions.

* The joint statement emphasised:

  * A rules-based WTO-led trade system
  * Removal of tariff and non-tariff barriers
  * Better logistics, connectivity, insurance, and reinsurance frameworks

* Target: **US$100 billion in bilateral trade by 2030**, though Modi hinted it may be achieved earlier.

* Experts note:

  * Rupee-denominated trade can help **reduce the widening trade deficit**.
  * Business links between the two countries are expanding **organically from the bottom up**, not just at the government level.

---

### **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

#### **Steps India Has Already Taken**

* **Rupee trade mechanism** opened for Russia after sanctions disrupted SWIFT transactions.
* Banks authorised to open **Vostro accounts** for Russia.
* Negotiations on pricing, exchange rates, and surplus rupee utilisation.
* Promotion of Indian exporters to Russia in:

  * Pharma
  * Engineering goods
  * Agricultural products
  * Textiles, gems & jewellery
