# LS passes nuclear energy Bill allowing privatisation
## SHANTI Bill, 2025 (Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India)

---

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

**India’s Nuclear Power Framework**

* Nuclear energy in India is governed mainly by:

  * **Atomic Energy Act, 1962** – gives the Union government complete control.
  * **Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act (CLNDA), 2010** – fixes liability in case of nuclear accidents.
* India follows a **three-stage nuclear programme** (PHWR → Fast Breeder → Thorium-based reactors).
* Nuclear energy is seen as:

  * A **clean, low-carbon baseload energy**
  * Crucial for **energy security** and **climate commitments (Net Zero by 2070)**.

**Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act, 2010 (Key Point)**

* Operator (usually NPCIL) is **strictly liable** for nuclear damage.
* **Section 17(b)** allows the operator to claim *recourse from suppliers* if an accident is due to defective equipment or services.
* This clause has been a **major concern for foreign suppliers** (US, France, etc.).

---

### 2. **The News**

* **Lok Sabha passed the SHANTI Bill, 2025**.
* Aim: **Incentivise private sector participation**, including **foreign companies**, in nuclear power generation.
* Bill will now be taken up by the **Rajya Sabha**.
* Opposition demanded referral to a **Parliamentary Standing Committee**, which was rejected.
* Major controversy:

  * Allegation that the Bill favours large conglomerates.
  * **Removal/weakening of supplier liability clause** under the CLNDA, 2010.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

**What SHANTI Bill Proposes**

* Opens doors for:

  * **Private Indian companies**
  * **Foreign nuclear suppliers**
* Aligns nuclear energy with:

  * Clean Energy Transition
  * Net Zero targets
* Attempts to resolve long-standing concerns of global nuclear vendors.

**Related Government Initiatives**

* **Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)** under Paris Agreement.
* **India–US Civil Nuclear Deal (2008)** – stalled partly due to liability concerns.
* **Small Modular Reactors (SMRs)** push.
* **Department of Atomic Energy (DAE)** under PMO oversight.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance (Analytical Perspective)**

#### A. **Arguments in Favour**

1. **Energy Security**

   * Reduces dependence on coal and imported fossil fuels.
2. **Climate Commitments**

   * Nuclear power is low-carbon and reliable.
3. **Technology & Investment**

   * Foreign participation brings advanced technology.
4. **Operational Efficiency**

   * Private sector efficiency can reduce delays and cost overruns.

#### B. **Concerns & Criticism**

1. **Dilution of Supplier Liability**

   * Shifts risk from suppliers to:

     * Operators
     * Ultimately the **Indian public**.
2. **Safety & Accountability**

   * Nuclear accidents have catastrophic, long-term impacts.
3. **Crony Capitalism Allegations**

   * Perception of favouring specific corporate houses.
4. **Federal & Democratic Oversight**

   * Passing without detailed parliamentary scrutiny raises governance concerns.

#### C. **Ethical & Governance Angle**

* **Precautionary Principle** vs **Ease of Doing Business**
* Public safety vs private profit
* Intergenerational equity (nuclear waste, radiation risks)

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Balanced Liability Framework**

   * Partial supplier liability instead of complete removal.
   * Mandatory insurance and nuclear damage funds.
2. **Strong Regulatory Oversight**

   * Empower **Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB)** with autonomy.
3. **Parliamentary Scrutiny**

   * Refer complex techno-legal bills to standing committees.
4. **Public Transparency**

   * Clear communication on safety standards and emergency preparedness.
5. **Diversified Clean Energy Mix**

   * Nuclear as a complement, not a replacement, to renewables.

# Change for the worse
## VB-G RAM G Bill, 2025 (Replacing MGNREGA) — Critical Analysis

---

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

**MGNREGA (2005) – Core Philosophy**

* A **rights-based law** under Article 41 (Right to Work – DPSP).
* Guarantees **100 days of wage employment** to every rural household on *demand*.
* Key pillars:

  * **Demand-driven** (work provided when demanded)
  * **Bottom-up decentralisation** (Gram Sabha, Panchayats)
  * **Centre bears full wage cost** for unskilled labour
  * Instrument of **Gram Swaraj** (Gandhian decentralised democracy)
* Acts as:

  * Livelihood security
  * Social safety net
  * Rural wage floor
  * Shock absorber (proved during COVID-19)

---

### 2. **The News**

* The **Viksit Bharat – Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin)** or **VB-G RAM G Bill, 2025** was tabled in Lok Sabha to **replace MGNREGA**.
* The Bill proposes:

  * Increasing work days to **125 days**
  * Reclassifying the scheme as a **Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS)**
  * Changing the governance and funding structure
* Strong opposition from:

  * State governments (Tamil Nadu, Kerala)
  * Critics citing erosion of federalism and decentralisation

---

### 3. **Key Changes Proposed (MGNREGA vs VB-G RAM G)**

| Aspect             | MGNREGA                          | VB-G RAM G Bill            |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Nature             | Rights-based Act                 | Scheme-like framework      |
| Work Provision     | Demand-driven                    | Supply-driven              |
| Funding            | Centre pays full unskilled wages | 60:40 Centre–State         |
| Decision-making    | Panchayats & States              | Union govt dominant        |
| Allocation         | Open-ended                       | Capped by Centre           |
| Excess expenditure | Centre liable                    | States liable              |
| Federal status     | Special law                      | Centrally Sponsored Scheme |

---

### 4. **Government’s Argument**

* **125 days of work** will enhance rural incomes.
* Alignment with **“Viksit Bharat”** vision.
* Better coordination to avoid overlap with agricultural seasons.
* Claims of improved governance efficiency.

---

### 5. **Critical Analysis (Mains Perspective)**

#### A. **Federalism & States’ Autonomy**

* Downgrading to CSS reduces States’ fiscal and administrative space.
* States already face:

  * GST-related fiscal stress
  * Reduced borrowing capacity
* Shifting costs to States undermines **cooperative federalism**.

#### B. **Demand vs Supply**

* MGNREGA’s strength: **legal entitlement on demand**.
* New Bill:

  * Capped allocations
  * Centre decides scale and timing
* This converts a **right into a discretion**.

#### C. **Employment Reality Check**

* Data shows:

  * Only **7–9% households** ever reached 100 days (except COVID year).
* So:

  * Increasing days to 125 is **symbolic**, not substantive.
  * Core issue is *availability*, not *upper limit*.

#### D. **Decentralisation & Democracy**

* Gram Sabha role diluted.
* Weakens **73rd Constitutional Amendment spirit**.
* Contradicts Gandhian **Gram Swaraj**, despite rhetorical claims.

#### E. **Political Economy Concern**

* Name change reflects **ideological repositioning**.
* Preference for **Direct Benefit Transfers (DBTs)** over work-based welfare:

  * DBTs may increase consumption
  * But **do not create community assets or dignity of labour**

---

### 6. **Ethical & Governance Dimension**

* **Work vs Cash**:

  * Work-based welfare preserves dignity.
  * Cash-only welfare risks dependency and politicisation.
* **Ram Rajya Ideal**:

  * True good governance requires:

    * Decentralisation
    * Participation
    * Accountability
* Centralisation weakens all three.

---

### 7. **Way Forward**

1. **Reform, Not Replace**

   * Retain MGNREGA’s rights-based nature.
2. **Consult States**

   * Any modification through Inter-State Council / Standing Committees.
3. **Strengthen Demand Realisation**

   * Timely fund release
   * Automatic compensation for delays.
4. **Improve Convergence**

   * Link MGNREGA works with:

     * Agriculture
     * Water conservation
     * Climate adaptation.
5. **Selective Improvements**

   * Avoid farm-season clashes through local planning, not central diktat.
