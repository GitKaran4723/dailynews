### 1. **Basic Understanding**

**What are the Aravalli Hills?**

* One of the **oldest mountain ranges in the world**.
* Stretch across **Gujarat – Rajasthan – Haryana – Delhi**.
* Act as:

  * **Ecological barrier** against desertification from the Thar
  * **Groundwater recharge zone**
  * **Carbon sink** for North India
  * Habitat for diverse flora and fauna

**Why are Aravallis critical for North India?**

* Protect Delhi–NCR from dust storms
* Regulate microclimate
* Prevent soil erosion and floods
* Maintain ecological balance in semi-arid regions

---

### 2. **The News (What Happened?)**

* The **Supreme Court of India** will take **suo motu cognisance** of public concern over the **new definition of the Aravalli Hills and Aravalli Range**.
* A **Special Vacation Bench of three judges**, headed by **Surya Kant**, will hear the matter.
* The concern is that the new definition may:

  * **Dilute environmental protection**
  * Enable **unregulated mining**
  * Cause irreversible ecological damage

---

### 3. **What Did the Supreme Court Decide Earlier? (November Judgment)**

The Court accepted recommendations of a committee constituted by the **Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC)**.

#### **New Definitions Accepted**

1. **Aravalli Hills**

   * Any landform with **elevation ≥ 100 metres above local relief**

2. **Aravalli Range**

   * A **cluster of two or more Aravalli Hills**
   * Located **within 500 metres of each other**

➡️ This replaced earlier, broader interpretations used in judicial orders and environmental regulations.

---

### 4. **Why Is There Public Furore?**

**Core concern**

* Many ecologically important areas:

  * May not meet the **100-metre elevation threshold**
  * Could be excluded from protection

**Possible consequences**

* Expansion of **legal mining**
* Increased **illegal mining camouflage as “non-Aravalli” land**
* Weakening of decades of judicial protection

**Fear**

> *A narrow technical definition may override ecological reality.*

---

### 5. **Mining & Aravallis: The Background Problem**

* Aravalli region has a long history of:

  * Illegal stone mining
  * Encroachment
  * Forest degradation
* Particularly severe in:

  * Haryana
  * Rajasthan
  * NCR region

Past Supreme Court orders had **banned or strictly regulated mining**, treating Aravallis as a **continuous ecological entity**, not just isolated hills.

---

### 6. **What the Supreme Court Also Directed**

The Court simultaneously tried to balance **environment and development**:

* Authorities must:

  * Identify:

    * **Permissible mining areas**
    * **Ecologically sensitive zones**
    * **Conservation-critical areas**
    * **Restoration priority zones**
* Mining:

  * **Strictly prohibited** in sensitive areas
  * Allowed **only under scientifically justified circumstances**

➡️ Indicates a **regulatory approach**, not blanket permission.

---

### 7. **Key Legal & Governance Issues Involved**

#### **1. Definition vs Ecological Continuity**

* Legal definitions may fragment ecosystems
* Ecology works as **landscape-level systems**

#### **2. Sustainable Mining vs Ecological Limits**

* Can “sustainable mining” exist in fragile hill systems?

#### **3. Judicial Oversight**

* Suo motu action reflects:

  * Court’s role as **guardian of environment**
  * Use of **Article 21 (Right to Life)**

---

### 8. **Mains Relevance (GS Paper II & III)**

**GS II – Polity**

* Judicial activism
* Environmental governance
* Role of Supreme Court in public interest

**GS III – Environment**

* Mining vs conservation
* Aravalli degradation
* Sustainable development

**Keywords for answers**

* Precautionary principle
* Intergenerational equity
* Ecological integrity
* Scientific governance

---

### 9. **Way Forward**

1. **Adopt landscape-based ecological definitions**, not only elevation-based
2. **Independent scientific mapping** using satellite & GIS
3. Strengthen **illegal mining enforcement mechanisms**
4. Involve:

   * State governments
   * Local communities
   * Environmental experts
5. Treat Aravallis as a **single ecological system**, not fragmented land parcels

---

### 10. **Conclusion**

The Aravalli case highlights a classic governance dilemma: **technical precision versus ecological wisdom**. While clarity in definition is important, environmental protection cannot be reduced to numerical thresholds alone. The Supreme Court’s suo motu cognisance signals recognition that **once ecosystems collapse, legal corrections come too late**.

# How India has managed toweave ‘RCEP minus China’
## **India’s ‘RCEP Minus China’ Strategy: Market Access Without Strategic Risk**
---

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

**What is RCEP?**

* **Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP)** is the world’s largest trade bloc.
* Members:

  * 10 ASEAN countries
  * Plus **China**, **Japan**, **South Korea**, **Australia**, **New Zealand**
* Covers ~30% of global GDP and population.

**What is an FTA?**

* A **Free Trade Agreement** reduces or eliminates tariffs on most goods and services between partners.
* FTAs involve deeper commitments than **preferential trade agreements**.

---

### 2. **The News**

* On **December 22**, **India** and **New Zealand** concluded negotiations on an **FTA**.
* With this, India now has FTAs with **all RCEP members except China**.
* Trade experts describe this as **“RCEP minus China”** — a deliberate and calibrated trade strategy.

---

### 3. **Why India Stayed Out of RCEP (2019)**

In **November 2019**, **Narendra Modi** announced that India would not join RCEP.

**Official reason**

* RCEP did not:

  * Reflect agreed guiding principles
  * Address India’s core concerns

**Underlying strategic concern**

* Entry into an **FTA with China**.
* Fear of:

  * Cheap Chinese imports flooding Indian markets
  * Harm to MSMEs, agriculture, and manufacturing
  * Worsening trade deficit

➡️ China’s manufacturing competitiveness far exceeds India’s in many sectors.

---

### 4. **The Core Risk: China Factor**

**Why China was a red line**

* Chinese goods are:

  * Highly subsidised
  * Scale-driven
  * Price-competitive
* An FTA would mean:

  * Near-zero tariffs
  * Loss of policy space

As industry representatives noted, **India could not absorb Chinese competition without structural damage**.

---

### 5. **The ‘RCEP Minus China’ Strategy Explained**

Instead of joining RCEP, India chose a **step-by-step bilateral route**.

#### **What India did**

* Signed or upgraded FTAs with:

  * ASEAN
  * Japan
  * South Korea
  * Australia
  * New Zealand
* Kept China outside comprehensive FTAs.

#### **China’s current trade framework**

* India–China trade is governed by:

  * **Asia Pacific Trade Agreement (APTA)**
* APTA:

  * Limited tariff concessions
  * Covers few products
  * No zero-duty floodgates

---

### 6. **Why This Strategy Is Better Than Joining RCEP**

According to trade experts:

#### **1. Market Access Without Tariff Surrender**

* India gets access to 14 RCEP markets
* Retains control over:

  * Tariff rates
  * Sensitive sectors

#### **2. Avoids Backdoor Chinese Entry**

* RCEP’s integrated rules of origin could have allowed:

  * Chinese goods to enter India via ASEAN countries
* Bilateral FTAs reduce this risk.

#### **3. Better Than a Direct India–China FTA**

* A bilateral FTA with China:

  * Would still allow exclusions and phased liberalisation
* RCEP:

  * Would dilute safeguards
  * Lock India into multilateral commitments

➡️ Hence, *RCEP would have been worse than even a direct China FTA*.

---

### 7. **Continuity and Change in India’s Trade Policy**

* Many FTAs with RCEP members:

  * Were signed **before 2014**
* Post-2014:

  * India became more cautious
  * Focus shifted to:

    * Strategic trade
    * Risk management
    * Supply-chain resilience

This marks a shift from **FTA enthusiasm to FTA selectivity**.

---

### 8. **Mains Relevance (GS Paper II & III)**

**GS II – International Relations**

* Strategic autonomy
* Balancing economic integration and national interest

**GS III – Economy**

* Trade deficits
* Manufacturing competitiveness
* Global value chains

**Keywords for answers**

* Smart protectionism
* Strategic trade sequencing
* Market access with policy autonomy
* Risk-adjusted globalisation

---

### 9. **Way Forward**

1. Improve **domestic manufacturing competitiveness**
2. Strengthen **rules of origin enforcement**
3. Use FTAs to:

   * Integrate into value chains
   * Boost exports
4. Continue **China-plus-one** trade strategy
5. Align trade policy with:

   * Make in India
   * Atmanirbhar Bharat

---

### 10. **Conclusion**

India’s decision to walk away from RCEP was not a retreat from globalisation, but a **recalibration**. By stitching together FTAs with RCEP members while keeping China at arm’s length, India has secured the economic benefits of regional integration **without importing systemic vulnerability**. The “RCEP minus China” model demonstrates that **strategic patience can outperform hasty multilateralism**.

---

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

**Foreign policy context of 2025**

* 2025 marked a **disruptive year** for **India’s** foreign policy.
* The guiding theme was **“shock and surprise”**, driven by:

  * Abrupt changes in U.S. global posture
  * Ongoing wars (Ukraine, Gaza)
  * Neighbourhood instability
  * Fragmentation of multilateralism

In UPSC terms, 2025 tested:

> *India’s strategic autonomy, diplomatic bandwidth, and crisis-management capacity.*

---

### 2. **Biggest Global Stories Affecting India**

#### **A. Return of Donald Trump & Global Disruption**

* **Donald Trump** sworn in for a second term (January 2025).
* Key impacts:

  * “**Liberation Day tariffs**” → destabilised global trade
  * Rattled U.S. alliances in:

    * Europe
    * Indo-Pacific
  * Altered stance on:

    * Russia
    * China

# Is the ‘health for all’ campaign on track?
## **India’s Health Sector in 2025: Funding Gaps, Disease Burden & Systemic Risks**

---

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

With a population of **146 crore**, **India** faces a **complex epidemiological transition**:

* Rising **non-communicable diseases (NCDs)** (diabetes, heart disease)
* Persistent & resurgent **infectious diseases**
* **Climate-change-related health risks** (air pollution, heat stress)
* **Antimicrobial resistance (AMR)**
* **Quality concerns in pharmaceuticals**
* Chronic **underfunding of public health**

Together, these stress-test India’s ability to ensure **“Health for All”**.

---

### 2. **Why Is There a Funding Deficit?**

#### **External Funding Shock (2025)**

* Early 2025: **Donald Trump** withdrew the U.S. from the **World Health Organization (WHO)**.
* Consequence:

  * Withdrawal of U.S. funding from global health programmes.
* India affected as a beneficiary of:

  * **PEPFAR**
  * **USAID**

**Impact on India**

* Funds dried up for:

  * HIV/AIDS programmes
  * Maternal & child health
  * Population services
* USAID committed **$97 million** for 7 projects, against a total portfolio of ~$750 million.

➡️ **Union and State governments had to plug the gap**, straining already limited fiscal space.

---

### 3. **Budgetary Allocation: The Core Constraint**

* India’s public health spending:

  * **Below 2% of GDP**
* **National Health Policy (2017)** target:

  * **2.5% of GDP**

#### **Budget 2025–26**

* Allocation: **₹99,859 crore**
* Increase: **~11%** year-on-year

**Why this is insufficient**

* Growing disease burden
* Expanding population
* Rising cost of technology & medicines
* Post-pandemic demand surge

➡️ Without breaching the **2–2.5% GDP threshold**, “Health for All” remains aspirational.

---

### 4. **Pressing Health Concerns in 2025**

#### **A. Resurgence of Infectious Diseases**

* Funding gaps weaken:

  * Surveillance
  * Early detection
  * Treatment continuity
* Raises risk of:

  * Higher mortality
  * Long-term morbidity

---

#### **B. Air Pollution as a Health Emergency**

* India faces **abysmal air quality** in many cities.
* Health effects:

  * Respiratory diseases
  * Cardiovascular illness
  * Reduced life expectancy

**Lesson**

* China’s **Beijing clean-air strategy** shows:

  * Strong regulation
  * Technology deployment
  * Inter-agency coordination
* India needs similar **war-footing action**.

---

### 5. **Why Did India Miss the TB Elimination Goal?**

* India advanced the global TB elimination target to **2025**.
* Goal **not achieved**, despite progress.

#### **Achievements**

* Improved diagnostics:

  * **TrueNat** (indigenous molecular test)
* Faster detection of:

  * TB
  * Drug resistance

#### **Persisting Challenges**

* Rising cases of:

  * **Multi-Drug Resistant TB (MDR-TB)**
  * **Extensively Drug Resistant TB (XDR-TB)**
* Social determinants:

  * Malnutrition
  * Crowded housing
  * Treatment non-adherence

➡️ TB elimination requires **health + nutrition + social protection**.

---

### 6. **Why Is AMR a Major Threat?**

**What is AMR?**

* When microbes evolve to resist antibiotics, making infections harder to treat.

#### **Alarming Data**

* WHO’s **GLASS Report**:

  * **1 in 3** bacterial infections in India involve resistant organisms
  * Global average: **1 in 6**

**High resistance seen in**

* *E. coli*
* *Klebsiella pneumoniae*
* *Staphylococcus aureus*
* Especially in **ICUs**

#### **Drivers of AMR in India**

* Over-the-counter antibiotic sales
* Self-medication
* Incomplete treatment courses
* Environmental contamination
* Weak regulatory enforcement

**Bright spot**

* **Kerala**:

  * Strong antimicrobial stewardship
  * Actual reduction in community AMR levels

➡️ Others must emulate Kerala while implementing **National Action Plan on AMR (Phase II)**.

---

### 7. **Pharmaceutical Quality: A Credibility Crisis**

#### **Triggering Incident (2025)**

* **25 children died in Madhya Pradesh**
* Cause:

  * Contaminated cough syrup
  * Contained **diethylene glycol** (industrial toxin)
* Manufactured in **Tamil Nadu**

#### **Why this is serious**

* Indicates:

  * Regulatory failure
  * Weak quality audits
* Not an isolated case:

  * **70 children died in The Gambia** earlier due to Indian-made cough syrups

➡️ Repeated incidents damage India’s image as the **“Pharmacy of the World”**.

---
