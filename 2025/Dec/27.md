# India flags attacks on minorities in Bangladesh
## Violence Against Minorities in Bangladesh & India’s Diplomatic Response

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

**Minorities in Bangladesh**

* Religious minorities mainly include **Hindus, Christians, and Buddhists**.
* Though Bangladesh was founded on **secular principles**, minority rights have remained vulnerable due to:

  * Political instability
  * Rise of extremist groups
  * Weak law-and-order enforcement at local levels

**India–Bangladesh Relations (Context)**

* India and Bangladesh share:

  * Civilisational links
  * Security cooperation
  * Economic and connectivity partnerships
* **Protection of minorities** is a sensitive but recurring diplomatic issue.

---

### 2. **The News (What Happened?)**

* India stated that **over 2,900 violent incidents** against minority communities occurred in Bangladesh during the interim government led by **Muhammad Yunus**.
* Incidents included:

  * Killings
  * Arson attacks
  * Lynching
  * Land grabbing
* India rejected claims that these were:

  * “Media exaggerations” or
  * “Political violence”

**Recent Triggers**

* Death of Islamist leader **Sharif Osman Hadi** (Dec 18)
* After his death:

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Diplomatic Signals**

**India**

* Rejected the “false narrative” that:

  * Perpetrators fled to India
  * India shelters Awami League leaders
* Asserted support for:

  * People of Bangladesh (not any one party)
  * Inclusive elections without exclusion of major stakeholders

**Bangladesh**

* Protests outside Indian missions in:

  * Dhaka, Delhi, Kolkata, Agartala, Siliguri
* Bangladesh summoned India’s envoy over protests

**Political Context**

* Possible exclusion of **Awami League** from elections
* Return of **Tariq Rahman**, leader of **Bangladesh Nationalist Party**, from exile

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance (UPSC GS-II & GS-III)**

**Key Issues**

* **Minority Rights & Human Rights**

  * State obligation vs extremist violence
* **Democratic Credibility**

  * Elections without inclusiveness weaken legitimacy
* **Neighbourhood First Policy**

# Centre’s experts had failed to define Aravallis for over a year before SC warning
## Aravalli Hills: Definition Dispute, Mining & Environmental Governance

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

**What are the Aravallis?**

* The **Aravalli Range** is one of the **oldest fold mountain systems in the world**.
* Extends ~700 km from **Delhi–Haryana → Rajasthan → Gujarat**.
* Ecological significance:

  * Acts as a **climatic barrier** (checks desertification from Thar)
  * Groundwater recharge
  * Biodiversity corridor
  * Prevents dust storms and land degradation

**Why definition matters**

* Legal definition decides:

  * What land gets **environmental protection**
  * Where **mining is allowed or prohibited**
* No uniform statutory definition exists across States → governance vacuum.

---

### 2. **The News (What happened?)**

* The **Supreme Court of India** asked the Centre to **define the Aravalli hills**.
* Despite:

  * 3 committees
  * Satellite imagery
  * Inputs from expert institutions
    → **No uniform technical definition** emerged for over a year.
* After the SC warned of **contempt proceedings**, a new sub-committee was formed (Aug 2025).

**Crucial Shift**

* Instead of defining Aravallis scientifically, the committee:

  * Tried to “**balance**” ecology with the **National Mineral Policy**
  * Policy encourages mining of **critical minerals** for economic growth.

**Outcome**

* Final definition allegedly protects **only hills above 100 metres height**.
* Vast majority of Aravalli terrain (especially low-lying hills) becomes **open to mining**.

---

### 3. **Institutions & Government Stand**

**Key Institutions Involved**

* **Forest Survey of India**
* **Geological Survey of India**
* Survey of India
* State Forest Departments
* Central Empowered Committee (SC)

**Scientific Disagreement**

* Earlier FSI (2010) approach:

  * Used **slope**, not height, to define Aravallis.
* Experts agreed:

  * **Height alone is flawed**
  * Not all Aravalli areas are hilly
  * Not all hills in the region are Aravalli (geologically)

**Political Response**

* Environment Minister **Bhupender Yadav** stated:

  * No new mining licences until a **Management Plan for Sustainable Mining (MPSM)** is prepared.
* MPSM to be drafted by **Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education**.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance (GS-III: Environment, Governance)**

**Core Issues**

* ❖ Environment vs Economic Growth trade-off
* ❖ Dilution of ecological safeguards through technical definitions
* ❖ Weak federal coordination (different State approaches)
* ❖ Judicial intervention in environmental governance

**Why this is problematic**

* Aravallis are **ecological systems**, not just “hills”
* Height-based definition:

  * Ignores groundwater zones, forest patches, wildlife corridors
* Mining risks:

  * Desertification
  * Loss of green cover
  * Air pollution (Delhi-NCR impact)
  * Irreversible geological damage

**Governance Concern**

* Shift from **science-based conservation** to **policy-convenient compromise**
* Raises question: *Is sustainable mining becoming a justification for regulatory dilution?*

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

**Scientific**

* Define Aravallis using **multi-criteria approach**:

  * Geological history
  * Rock composition
  * Slope + relief + drainage
  * Vegetation and hydrology

**Institutional**

* Statutory backing to Aravalli protection (like Western Ghats ESAs)
* Strengthen role of independent scientific bodies

**Policy**

* Mining only after:

  * Landscape-level Environmental Impact Assessment
  * Carrying capacity studies
* Align mineral policy with:

  * SDGs
  * India’s climate commitments
  * Intergenerational equity

**Judicial**

* SC oversight till a **credible, science-first definition** is notified

# Gates and windows
## Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of Electoral Rolls: Democratic Risks & Administrative Gatekeeping
### 1. **Basic Understanding**

**What is SIR?**

* The **Special Intensive Revision (SIR)** is a periodic exercise conducted by the **Election Commission of India**.
* Objective:

  * Remove **duplicate entries**
  * Delete names of **deceased voters**
  * Correct **outdated or incorrect addresses**
  * Ensure **purity of electoral rolls**

**Why is it important?**

* Electoral rolls are the **foundation of free and fair elections**.
* Errors can lead to:

  * Bogus voting (if names remain)
  * **Disenfranchisement** (if genuine voters are deleted)

---

### 2. **The News (What is the Issue Now?)**

* The ongoing SIR, modelled on the **Bihar SIR**, is being rolled out in multiple States.
* While the **aim is reasonable**, the **design and execution** show **systemic flaws**.
* The process is:

  * **Extremely fast**
  * **Digitally dependent**
  * Shifts the **burden of proof from the State to the voter**

**Key Concern**

* The ECI appears to be **treating voter exclusion as an acceptable risk** rather than an exceptional failure.

---

### 3. **Problems in the Current SIR Design**

#### a) **Speed over Accuracy**

* Tight deadlines for:

  * House-to-house verification
  * Form collection
  * Digitisation
* State staff are already burdened with **multiple duties**.
* Result:

  * “Target-chasing” instead of careful verification.

#### b) **Burden Shift to the Citizen**

* Voters must now:

  * Prove identity again
  * Refer to **2002–2005 electoral rolls**
* These old rolls:

  * Are **not machine-readable**
  * Have inconsistencies
* Even **minor mismatches** → deletion.

#### c) **Digital Exclusion**

* Digital tools assumed to be neutral, but:

  * Poor literacy
  * Limited internet access
  * Lack of devices
* → Exclusion of the elderly, migrants, women, informal workers.

---

### 4. **Claims & Objections: Why Appeals Are Not Enough**

* Appeals work **only if the voter**:

  * Knows they were deleted
  * Has time and resources
  * Can travel, collect documents, fill forms
* This selects for voters with:

  * Education
  * Social capital
  * Time and confidence

**Reality**

* If a voter:

  * Does not realise deletion
  * Cannot pursue appeal
    → **Error becomes an “official fact”**

---

### 5. **Transparency & Accountability Gaps**

* Missing public information:

  * Precise **reasons for deletions**
  * **Booth-level and demographic data**
  * Gender-wise or region-wise patterns
* Without this:

  * Civil society
  * Smaller political parties
  * Journalists
    cannot flag failures **in real time**.

---

### 6. **Mains Relevance (GS-II: Polity & Governance)**

**Core Democratic Concerns**

* Right to vote = **basic democratic right**
* Administrative processes must:

  * Enable inclusion
  * Not act as filters

**Governance Issues**

* Procedural fairness vs administrative efficiency
* Risk of **institutional disenfranchisement**
* Unequal impact on:

  * Migrants
  * Urban poor
  * Women
  * Informal sector workers

**Conceptual Framing**

* SIR is becoming **administrative gatekeeping**:

  * Two-tier electorate:

    1. Those who can repeatedly “re-prove” citizenship
    2. Those who cannot

---

### 7. **Way Forward**

**Process Reforms**

* Slow down SIR where exclusions spike
* Use **State responsibility principle**:

  * State must justify deletions, not voters prove existence

**Technological Fixes**

* Digitise old electoral rolls properly
* Allow **auto-matching with Aadhaar, ration cards, civil registration** (with safeguards)

**Transparency**

* Publish:

  * Booth-wise deletion data
  * Gender and socio-economic patterns
* Enable public audits in real time

**Appeals**

* Multiple appeal windows
* Proactive communication (SMS/door notices)
* On-the-spot correction camps

# Social scourge
## Ending Child Marriage in India: Progress, Gaps & the Road to SDG-2030

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

**What is child marriage?**

* Marriage where **either spouse is below 18 years (girl)** or **21 years (boy)**.
* It violates:

  * Child rights
  * Gender equality
  * Right to education and health

**India’s global commitment**

* India has committed to **ending child marriage by 2030** under the **Sustainable Development Goals** (Target 5.3).
* Ending child marriage is also a **multiplier goal**—it impacts education, health, poverty, nutrition and gender equality.

---

### 2. **The News**

* The Union government marked **one year of the Bal Vivah Mukt Bharat Abhiyan**, launching a **100-day awareness campaign**.
* **Progress made**:

  * Child marriage declined from **47.4% (2005-06)** to **23.3% (2019-21)** as per **National Family Health Survey** data.
* **However**, progress is:

  * Uneven
  * State-specific
  * Strongly linked to socio-economic status

**High prevalence States (women aged 18–29):**

* West Bengal
* Bihar
* Tripura
  Closely followed by Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan.

---

### 3. **Socio-Economic Drivers (Why It Persists)**

**Poverty**

* 40% of girls from the **lowest wealth quintile** married before 18
* Only 8% from the **highest quintile**

**Education**

* 48% of girls with **no education** married before 18
* Only 4% among girls with **higher education**

**Health & Gender Norms**

* Early marriage → early pregnancy → maternal mortality, malnutrition
* Seen as:

  * Economic burden reduction
  * “Protection” of family honour

(Findings corroborated by **UN Population Fund** analysis.)

---

### 4. **Legal & Policy Framework**

**Key Law**

* **Prevention of Child Marriage Act**, 2006

  * Makes child marriage voidable
  * Penalises facilitators

**Problems in enforcement**

* Low reporting
* Low conviction rates (NCRB data)
* Social acceptance overrides law

**Associated Law Concerns**

* **Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act**:

  * No space for consensual adolescent relationships
  * Fear of criminalisation pushes girls to:

    * Unsafe abortions
    * Unregistered medical help

---

### 5. **Why Schemes Alone Are Not Enough**

**Example: West Bengal**

* Despite cash incentive schemes for girls’ education, child marriage remains high.
* Shows that:

  * **Cash ≠ social transformation**
  * Infrastructure and safety matter

**Limitations of flagship campaigns**

* **Beti Bachao Beti Padhao**:

  * Needs deeper reach into:

    * Poorest households
    * Migrant communities
    * Rural & tribal belts

**Missing links**

* Functional toilets in schools
* Safe public transport
* Secondary schools near habitations

---

### 6. **Mains Relevance (GS-II & GS-IV)**

**Governance Issues**

* Gap between policy intent and grassroots outcomes
* Weak last-mile delivery
* Law vs lived social norms

**Ethical & Social Dimensions**

* Intergenerational cycle of:

  * Poverty
  * Poor health
  * Disempowerment
* Child marriage undermines:

  * Women’s agency
  * Human capital formation

**SDG Perspective**

* According to **Girls Not Brides**, **9 of 17 SDGs** cannot be achieved without ending child marriage.

---

### 7. **Way Forward**

**Education-First Approach**

* Ensure:

  * Universal secondary education
  * Skill-linked schooling for girls

**Health & Legal Balance**

* Adolescent-friendly health services
* Review rigid application of criminal laws without diluting child protection

**Economic Support**

* Conditional cash transfers linked to:

  * School attendance
  * Skill training
* Livelihood support to families

**Community Engagement**

* Work with:

  * Panchayats
  * SHGs
  * Religious and community leaders

**Data & Monitoring**

* District-level dashboards
* Gender-disaggregated tracking
* Accountability of local officials
