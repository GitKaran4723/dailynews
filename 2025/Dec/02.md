# SC tasks CBI to tackle ‘digital arrests’
## **Digital Arrest Scams & Supreme Court’s Directive for CBI Probe**

---

## **1. Basic Understanding**

### **What is a Digital Arrest Scam?**

* A *digital arrest* scam is a form of cyber fraud where criminals impersonate law enforcement officials (CBI, Police, ED, RBI) and **threaten victims with fake cases**, claiming:

  * Their bank account is linked to illegal activity
  * Their Aadhaar or PAN is misused
  * They face imminent arrest
* Victims—often **senior citizens**—are coerced into staying on a video call and instructed to transfer money to “safe accounts”.
* These accounts are usually **mule accounts**, created using forged documents or through corrupt bank officials.

### **Why is it dangerous?**

* Induces high psychological pressure
* Extracts large sums in multiple transactions
* Uses sophisticated social engineering + foreign call centres
* Difficult to trace due to “layering”: money routed across multiple accounts

### **Legal Framework Involved**

* **Information Technology Act, 2000**
* **IPC provisions on cheating & impersonation**
* **Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA)** in certain cases
* **Delhi Special Police Establishment Act (DSPE), Section 6** – governs CBI jurisdiction & state consent

---

## **2. The News**

* On **Monday**, a **Supreme Court Bench of CJI Surya Kant & Justice Joymalya Bagchi** ordered a **pan-India CBI investigation** into major **digital arrest scams**.
* **Reason:** Scamsters have already defrauded victims of **₹3,000 crore**, mainly targeting elderly citizens.
* The Court said **“enough is enough”** and that the CBI must focus **first** on digital arrests, followed by:

  1. Fraudulent investment scams
  2. Fake part-time job schemes

### **Key Directives:**

1. **CBI given a free hand** to investigate bankers enabling mule accounts.
2. **States ordered** to give consent under Section 6, DSPE Act — including TN, Kerala, Karnataka, Bengal, MP, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, etc.
3. **CBI to coordinate with Interpol** to identify foreign cybercrime hubs.
4. **RBI impleaded** to explain use of **AI/ML** to track money “layering”.
5. **Online intermediaries** instructed to cooperate under IT Rules, 2021.
6. **Telecom operators** pulled up for negligent SIM issuance; DoT asked for corrective proposals.
7. **States/UTs** to operationalise **regional cybercrime coordination centres** linked to **I4C**.

This direct direction to the CBI—**overriding federal constraints**—is termed *extraordinary* by the court.

# The new action plan on AMR needs a shot in the arm
## **National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance (NAP-AMR 2.0): A Strengthened Vision, but Missing the Federal Architecture**

---

## **1. Basic Understanding**

### **What is Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)?**

* AMR occurs when microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, viruses, parasites) **stop responding** to medicines.
* This makes infections harder to treat and increases:

  * mortality
  * healthcare costs
  * disease spread

### **Why AMR is a One Health Challenge**

AMR spreads through interconnected systems:

* **Human health:** misuse of antibiotics; poor infection control
* **Animal health:** antibiotics in veterinary care & livestock
* **Aquaculture:** antibiotic-fed fish farms
* **Agriculture:** crop production using antibiotic-laced fertilizers or pesticides
* **Environment:** pharmaceutical waste, hospital discharge, sewage
* **Food chain:** contaminated meat, milk, vegetables, water

Thus, AMR circulates beyond hospitals — through **soil, water, markets, food systems**, making multi-sectoral action essential.

---

## **2. The News**

* India released the **National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance (NAP-AMR 2.0) for 2025–29**.
* This comes at a time when AMR is rapidly worsening across **human, animal, environmental, aquaculture and food systems**.
* The new plan:

  * Strengthens surveillance
  * Emphasises diagnostics and innovation
  * Recognises AMR as a development challenge
  * Pushes for private sector involvement
  * Deepens the One Health perspective
  * Establishes national oversight through **NITI Aayog**

But its core weakness remains — **no binding mechanism to ensure State-level implementation**, even though key AMR determinants fall under State jurisdiction.

---

## **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

### **Achievements of NAP-AMR (2017–23)**

* Brought AMR into national discourse
* Expanded laboratory and surveillance networks
* Strengthened stewardship programmes
* Initiated One Health integration
* Encouraged a few States (Kerala, MP, Delhi, AP, Gujarat, Sikkim, Punjab) to prepare State-level AMR Action Plans

### **Key Advancements in NAP-AMR 2.0**

1. **Clear timelines & responsibilities**
2. **Integrated surveillance** across human, veterinary, agriculture, aquaculture, and environment
3. **Private sector involvement** – crucial because most healthcare & veterinary services are private
4. **Innovation focus** – diagnostics, alternatives to antibiotics, waste monitoring
5. **NITI Aayog-led governance**

   * A **Coordination and Monitoring Committee** provides inter-sectoral oversight
6. **Mandate for States & UTs** to:

   * Create **State AMR Cells**
   * Draft & implement **State Action Plans**
   * Upload progress on a national dashboard

### **Gaps Already Recognised**

* States have not implemented AMR plans uniformly
* AMR determinants—pharmacy regulation, hospitals, veterinary sector, agriculture, waste management—lie with State governments
* National guidance alone not enough

---

## **4. Mains Relevance**

### **A. Key Issues & Challenges**

#### **1. Absence of a Federal Implementation Mechanism**

* No structured Centre–State AMR council
* No statutory obligations for States to notify or implement plans
* No financial incentives or NHM-linked budget
* No joint reviews like TB or NHM programmes

#### **2. Fragmented Sectoral Responsibility**

* Human health: Health Dept & hospitals
* Animal health: Veterinary Dept
* Agriculture: pesticide regulators

* Food safety: FSSAI & state departments
* Waste systems: Urban/Rural local bodies
  → Without an integrated platform, sectoral fragmentation continues.

#### **3. Weak Surveillance in States**

* Limited labs
* Inconsistent reporting
* Poor integration of data from:

  * private hospitals
  * veterinary labs
  * food systems
  * environment monitoring stations

#### **4. Poor Stewardship & Irrational Antibiotic Use**

* OTC availability of antibiotics
* Unregulated pharmacies
* Overuse in poultry, fisheries, and dairy
* Inadequate hospital infection control

#### **5. Private Sector Gaps**

* No binding obligations for infection control
* Weak oversight of private veterinary clinics

### **B. Impacts on Society, Economy and Governance**

#### **Human Health**

* Hard-to-treat infections
* Increased mortality & morbidity
* High out-of-pocket expenditure

#### **Economy**

* Productivity loss in humans & livestock
* Rising healthcare costs
* Burden on dairy, fisheries and agriculture sectors

---

## **5. Way Forward**

### **1. Create a Formal Centre–State AMR Framework**

* Establish a **National–State AMR Council** chaired by the Union Health Minister.
* Include:

  * Chief Secretaries
  * Veterinary & Agriculture departments
  * Environment & Urban bodies
  * NITI Aayog
* Conduct **biannual joint reviews** similar to TB and NHM.

### **2. Mandate and Monitor State Action Plans**

* Centre should officially request all States/UTs to:

  * Notify their AMR Action Plans
  * Set annual targets
  * Report progress via the national dashboard
* Link accountability to Health Ministry & Chief Secretary levels.

### **3. Introduce Financial Incentives**

* Use **NHM conditional grants** for:

  * Surveillance strengthening
  * Hospital infection control
  * Veterinary diagnostic labs
  * Waste management reforms
* Funding signals priority → States respond quickly.

### **4. Strengthen Regulatory Systems**

* Strict control on antibiotic sales in pharmacies
* Ban OTC antibiotics except essentials
* Regulate antibiotic use in:

  * poultry farms
  * aquaculture
  * crops
* Environmental norms for pharmaceutical and hospital waste discharge.

### **5. Build Surveillance Capacity Across One Health Sectors**

* Expand AMR testing labs across:

  * public & private hospitals
  * veterinary centres
  * agriculture universities
  * environmental labs
* Create integrated data platforms accessible to national & State authorities.

### **6. Engage the Private Sector Meaningfully**

* Mandate infection control audits for:

  * private hospitals
  * diagnostic labs
  * veterinary clinics
* Introduce accreditation incentives for compliance.

### **7. Invest in Innovation**

* Rapid diagnostics for primary care
* Alternatives to antibiotics:

  * vaccines
  * phage therapy
  * probiotics
* Wastewater treatment technologies
* R&D grants through ICMR, DBT, ICAR

---

## **Conclusion**

The NAP-AMR 2.0 is scientifically strong and strategically sound.
But **without a formal Centre–State coordination mechanism**, statutory backing, and dedicated funding, the plan risks remaining a **document of intent** rather than a **nationwide operational programme**.

If India builds a coordinated, accountable federal architecture, NAP-AMR 2.0 can become a turning point not only for India but a model for global One Health cooperation.

# Capturing urban dynamism in the 2027 Census
## **Census 2027 & the Need for Recognising Transitional Urban Areas: Towards a Geo-Statistical, Spatially Accurate Urban India**

---

## **1. Basic Understanding**

### **What is the Census?**

* India conducts a **decennial Census**, the world’s largest administrative data-collection exercise.
* It provides foundational data for:

  * policymaking
  * welfare schemes
  * fiscal transfers
  * district planning
  * socio-economic research

### **What’s new in Census 2027?**

* First Census with **dedicated mobile apps** for digital data collection.
* **Geo-tagging of buildings** to improve address accuracy.
* **Real-time monitoring platforms** for transparency & verification.

### **Why the debate on “urban”?**

* India uses a conservative **threefold definition** (Census 2011):

  1. **Minimum population:** 5,000
  2. **Density:** 400 persons/sq. km
  3. **75% male main workers in non-agriculture**
* This leads to serious **under-recognition of urban reality**.
* Many fast-growing settlements are **peri-urban or transitional**, but are recorded as “rural”.

### **Why does this matter?**

* Misclassification → misallocation of resources.
* Transitional areas remain under-served though they have **urban characteristics**:

  * high density
  * commercial activities
  * migrant influx
  * infrastructure pressures

This affects:

* urban infrastructure planning
* NUHM coverage
* disaster management
* pollution & transport planning
* housing schemes

---

## **2. The News**

* On **October 8, 2025**, MoHUA observed **World Habitat Day** in New Delhi on the theme **“Urban Solutions to Crisis.”**
* As part of the discussion on sustainable urbanisation, attention turned to **Census 2027**.
* Concerns were raised that:

  * Census 2027 plans to **retain the old 2011 definition of “urban.”**
  * India’s actual urban footprint is far larger than Census estimates.
  * Peri-urban areas and mega-agglomerations, such as the **true extent of Delhi (Delhi–Gurugram–Faridabad–Noida–Ghaziabad)**, remain unrecognised.
* The article argues for:

  * adopting **global methods** like UN’s **Degree of Urbanisation**
  * integrating **spatial, geo-statistical mapping**
  * recognising multi-city agglomerations
  * using **open-access geospatial portals**

---

## **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

### **A. Digital Transformation of Census 2027**

  * Classifies areas as **urban centre**, **urban cluster**, **rural**
* India is exploring compatible methodologies.

---

## **4. Mains Relevance**

### **A. Issues & Challenges**

#### **1. Conservative Definition Hides Real Urbanisation**

* Census 2011 recorded **31% urban**, but World Bank (2010) estimated **55.3%** of India lives in areas with urban characteristics.
* This leads to:

  * underestimation of service needs
  * misclassification of peri-urban villages
  * fragmented planning

#### **2. Binary Urban–Rural Classification**

* No category for peri-urban or “rurban.”
* Fails to reflect complex settlement patterns.

#### **3. Administrative Boundaries vs. Functional Cities**

* Mega-agglomerations (Delhi NCR, Mumbai Metropolitan Region, Bengaluru region) function as **single urban ecosystems**.
* Census counts them separately by:

  * ULBs
  * districts
  * state boundaries
    → leading to fragmented policies.

#### **4. Dynamic Boundaries Complicate Time-Series Analysis**

* Frequent changes to wards/ULB limits distort long-term comparisons.
* Need for **static spatial grids** (such as 1×1 km).

#### **5. Peri-urban Areas Receive Inadequate Services**

* Poor water supply
* Inadequate waste management
* Weak transport connectivity
* No NUHM or urban scheme coverage
* High environmental vulnerability

#### **6. Data Privacy, Quality, and Interoperability**

* Spatial datasets must:

  * anonymise sensitive information
  * maintain compatibility with national digital platforms

---

## **B. Impact on Governance, Economy, Society**

### **Governance**

* Classification inaccuracies distort:

  * fiscal transfers
  * urban-rural scheme targeting
  * disaster planning (e.g., floods in peri-urban belts)
* Recognising agglomerations improves transport, housing, pollution management.

### **Economy**

* Market decisions depend on population density and service demand.
* Recognising functional cities helps:

  * labour market mapping
  * logistics planning
  * industrial corridor planning

### **Society & Services**

* Peri-urban zones often house migrants with:

  * limited basic services
  * insecure housing
  * high pollution
  * weak health infrastructure

### **Environment**

* Peri-urban areas are ecological hotspots:

  * wetlands
  * forests
  * agriculture
    → conversion occurs fastest here; misclassification leads to unregulated sprawl.

---

## **5. Way Forward**

### **1. Adopt the UN’s Degree of Urbanisation (DEGURBA)**

* Classify regions into:

  * **urban centres**
  * **urban clusters**
  * **rural areas**
* Reflects settlement morphology rather than administrative labels.

### **2. Recognise Functional Agglomerations**

* Treat Delhi NCR, Mumbai MMR, Bengaluru region, Hyderabad region as **single functional units** in Census metadata.
* Supports integrated regional planning (transport, pollution control, labour mobility).

### **3. Build a National Geo-Statistical Portal**

* Open-access, anonymised, GIS-based platform
* Combine Census data with:

  * Gati Shakti layers
  * Digital Pincode systems
  * municipal data
  * population grids
* Provide:

  * heatmaps
  * density maps
  * service access maps
  * climate vulnerability overlays

### **4. Introduce Static Spatial Grids (e.g., 1×1 km)**

* Reduces distortions from changing ULB or ward boundaries.
* Enables:

  * consistent time-series analysis
  * better hotspot detection
* Use blended indicators for privacy (masking caste/income).

### **5. Integrate Climate & Hazard Mapping**

* Combine demographic grids with:

  * heat island data
  * flood-risk zones
  * air quality maps
    → guides climate-resilient infrastructure.

### **6. Encourage Real-time Municipal Data Updates**

* Encourage ULBs to upload updates year-round.
* Link updates with:

  * Smart Cities dashboards
  * AMRUT reforms
  * property tax modernization

### **7. Policy Support for Peri-Urban Areas**

* Extend NUHM, water supply schemes, waste management, pollution regulation to transitional settlements.
* Create special funding windows or urbanisation grants.

### **8. Build Interoperability with National Platforms**

* Gati Shakti
* National Geospatial Policy
* Digital Pincode system
* SVAMITVA
  This will ensure a standardized, spatially enriched data architecture.

### **9. Improve Data Governance & Privacy**

* Anonymisation standards
* Controlled access APIs
* Spatial masking for sensitive socio-economic indicators

---

## **Conclusion**

The 2027 Census is a historic opportunity.
If India continues with older, conservative definitions, it risks overlooking the rapidly expanding **peri-urban and transitional spaces** where most population growth is now concentrated.

A **geo-statistical, spatially integrated Census** can:

* reveal the true shape of Indian urbanisation
* improve scheme targeting
* strengthen climate resilience
* help ULBs plan better
* enable innovations by researchers and startups

By embracing modern spatial methods and recognising functional urban regions, India can build a **more inclusive, data-driven, and future-ready urban strategy**.
