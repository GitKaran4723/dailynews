# Citizenship under CAA only if claims verified: SC
## **Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 – Supreme Court’s Latest Observation**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

**Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 (CAA):**

* The CAA seeks to provide a pathway to Indian citizenship for *non-Muslim* religious minorities—Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis, and Christians—from **Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh**, who entered India before **31 December 2014** due to *religious persecution* or fear of it.
* It relaxes the residency requirement from **11 years to 5 years** for these groups.
* The Act does **not automatically grant citizenship**; individuals must still **apply**, submit evidence, and go through verification.

**Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of Electoral Rolls:**

* Conducted periodically by the Election Commission to update voter lists.
* People fearing exclusion from the electoral roll worry this might affect their citizenship claims.

**Key Constitutional Provision:**

* Citizenship is governed by **Articles 5–11** of the Constitution and the **Citizenship Act, 1955**.

---

### **2. The News**

* On **Tuesday**, a **Supreme Court Bench** comprising **CJI Surya Kant** and **Justice Joymalya Bagchi** stated that **grant of rights associated with Indian citizenship under the CAA is *not automatic***.
* The court clarified that people claiming to be persecuted minorities under the CAA must undergo **proper verification**, and their **claims must be proved true** before citizenship benefits can be conferred.
* This observation came during the hearing of a petition by **NGO Aatmadeep**, which argued that CAA-protected groups (especially those from Bangladesh living in **West Bengal**) fear the ongoing **SIR of electoral rolls** may render them *stateless*.
* The Supreme Court acknowledged the concern but emphasized that:

  * Citizenship under CAA requires **fulfilment of prescribed conditions**.
  * Only after obtaining citizenship can applicants seek **inclusion in electoral rolls**.
* The court issued **notice to the Election Commission and the Central Government**, asking for their response.
* The matter has been **listed for hearing next week**.

---

### **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **CAA, 2019:** Provides the legal pathway for persecuted minorities to apply for Indian citizenship.
* **Citizenship Rules, 2024:** Operationalised the CAA framework and laid out the **application procedure**, document requirements, and verification mechanisms.
* **Election Commission Guidelines:** Ensure that only Indian citizens are included in the electoral roll after due scrutiny.
* **Foreigners Act, 1946 & Passport Act, 1920:** Used in conjunction with CAA to regulate entry, stay, and deportation of foreigners.

---

### **4. Mains Relevance**

#### **Issues & Challenges**

* **Verification of “religious persecution”**: Difficult to objectively establish, especially when applicants may lack documentation.
* **Fear of statelessness:** Communities awaiting citizenship regularisation are anxious during processes like SIR.
* **Administrative burden:** Verification requires coordination among MHA, FRROs, state governments, and local police.
* **Federal concerns:** States like West Bengal and Kerala have opposed CAA implementation, raising Centre–State friction.
* **Human rights considerations:** Risk of exclusion if genuine applicants fail documentation requirements.

#### **Impact on Society & Polity**

* **Political Sensitivity:** CAA remains a politically polarising issue, influencing electoral politics.
* **Social Cohesion:** Differential pathways to citizenship for specific groups may create perceptions of discrimination.
* **Governance & Bureaucracy:** Places heavy demands on administrative machinery for verification and roll revision.

#### **Ethical & Governance Concerns**

* Balancing **sovereign control over citizenship** with **humanitarian obligations**.
* Ensuring that **non-arbitrary**, transparent, and fair procedures are followed during verification.
* Preventing **misinformation** among vulnerable groups.

---

### **5. Way Forward**

1. **Clear Communication to Applicants**

   * Government should issue **public advisories** explaining that SIR does not affect CAA protections unless fraud is proven.

2. **Strengthening Verification Mechanisms**

   * Develop **uniform guidelines** for evaluating “religious persecution claims.”
   * Use technology (digitised applications, Aadhaar linkage post-citizenship) to minimise errors.

3. **Coordination Between Centre and States**

   * Establish dedicated **citizenship facilitation cells** in states like West Bengal, Assam, Gujarat, Delhi.

4. **Protection from Statelessness**

   * Ensure **temporary documentation** for applicants under process so they do not lose access to welfare services.

5. **Transparent Electoral Roll Practices**

   * EC must ensure **fair SIR procedures** without intimidation of migrant communities.
   * Periodic audits to reduce wrongful deletions.

6. **Humanitarian Framework**

   * Emphasise India’s tradition of offering refuge while maintaining legal safeguards.

# Trump mulls tariffs on rice from India
## **U.S. Hinting at Tariffs on Indian Rice – Trade, Tariffs & Implications**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

**Tariffs:**

* Tariffs are taxes imposed on imported goods to protect domestic industries or respond to perceived unfair trade practices.
* Higher tariffs make imports costlier, reducing their competitiveness.

**Dumping:**

* “Dumping” occurs when a country exports goods at prices lower than domestic market value to capture foreign markets.
* Countries can respond by imposing **anti-dumping duties**.

**India–U.S. Trade in Rice:**

* India is the world’s largest rice exporter.
* The U.S. is a small market for India (only **~3%** of India’s rice exports), but **India is a major supplier to the U.S.**, accounting for **over 25%** of U.S. rice imports.

**Context of Current Tariffs:**

* The U.S. already imposes **50% total tariffs** on several imports from India after past trade disputes (e.g., GSP withdrawal in 2019).

---

### **2. The News**

* Ahead of a scheduled meeting between Indian officials and a U.S. trade delegation led by **Deputy USTR Rick Switzer** (Dec 10–12 in New Delhi), **President Donald Trump** signaled a possible new tariff action—this time targeting **Indian rice**.
* Trump accused India of “dumping rice” into the U.S. market.
* Trade data analysis shows:

  * Only **3%** of India’s rice exports are directed to the U.S.—so India’s export revenue impact would be minimal.
  * But India contributes **more than one-fourth** of all rice imported by the U.S.—making it a critical supplier for American consumers.
* Therefore, raising tariffs on Indian rice may **hurt the U.S. more** than India by increasing consumer prices and shrinking supply.
* This threat comes when both countries are preparing to negotiate solutions to ongoing tariff disputes.

---

### **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

**India:**

* **Trade negotiations through the Ministry of Commerce and MEA** to protect export interests.
* **Diversification of export markets**, especially for rice (Middle East, Africa, Europe).
* **Minimum Support Price (MSP)** and buffer stock policies to stabilise domestic markets.
* **APEDA initiatives** to expand basmati and non-basmati exports globally.

**U.S.:**

* Use of **Section 301** and other trade laws for retaliatory tariffs.
* **Farm Bill subsidies** support U.S. rice farmers, making their industry sensitive to global competition.
* Tariff policy as a political tool ahead of elections.

**Bilateral mechanisms:**

* **India–U.S. Trade Policy Forum (TPF)** for dialogue on tariffs, market access, agriculture, and WTO disputes.
* **WTO frameworks** on anti-dumping and dispute settlement.

---

### **4. Mains Relevance**

#### **Issues & Challenges**

* **Trade protectionism:** Increasing U.S. tariffs reflect rising economic nationalism.
* **Market dependence:** U.S. consumers’ reliance on Indian rice exposes their supply vulnerability.
* **Disruption of global value chains:** Tariff uncertainties affect farmers, exporters, logistics, and importers.
* **Diplomatic strain:** Tariff threats undermine strategic ties (Quad, Indo-Pacific cooperation).
* **WTO compatibility:** New tariffs may violate multilateral trade rules.

#### **Economic & Strategic Impacts**

**On India:**

* Limited direct impact due to small U.S. share in rice exports.
* Indirect benefits: India may redirect exports to other markets without major losses.
* Could strengthen India’s image as a **reliable global food supplier**.

**On the U.S.:**

* Domestic rice prices may increase due to higher import costs.
* American exporters may face retaliatory tariffs from India.
* Political pressure from U.S. rice importers and retailers may rise.

**On Bilateral Relations:**

* Tariff tensions could spill over into broader trade issues like:

  * Medical devices price caps
  * Digital trade
  * E-commerce rules
  * Market access in agriculture

#### **Ethical/Governance Angle**

* Using tariffs for political messaging raises questions about **fair trade practices**.
* Protectionism vs. consumer welfare: tariffs may hurt poor consumers the most.

---

### **5. Way Forward**

1. **Engage Proactively Through Dialogue**

   * Use the upcoming talks in New Delhi to correct data misconceptions about “dumping.”
   * Highlight mutual economic interdependence.

2. **Leverage WTO Mechanisms**

   * If unilateral tariffs are imposed, India could seek consultations under WTO’s **Dispute Settlement Mechanism**.

3. **Strengthen Export Diversification**

   * Reduce exposure to tariff risks by expanding markets in **Africa, Southeast Asia, and Europe**.

4. **Stabilise Domestic Rice Sector**

   * Support farmers through MSP, extension services, and export facilitation.
   * Enhance quality certification to maintain global competitiveness.

5. **Calibrated Retaliation (If Needed)**

   * India may impose proportionate counter-tariffs while keeping channels of negotiation open.

6. **Build Long-Term Resilient Trade Relations**

   * Promote frameworks like **Indo-U.S. CECA (Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement)** in the long run.
   * Encourage private sector consultations to anticipate trade friction.

# Care as disability justice, dignity in mental health
## **Reimagining Mental Health Care in India: From Deficit Models to Dignity, Justice, and Contextual Healing**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

#### **Psychosocial Disability**

* Refers to difficulties in social participation, functioning, or quality of life arising from mental health conditions **and** the social barriers around them.
* Unlike purely medical models focusing on symptoms, psychosocial disability recognises:

  * Social stigma
  * Economic precarity
  * Trauma
  * Exclusion
  * Lack of relational support

#### **Deficit Lens vs. Disability Justice**

* **Deficit lens:** Views individuals as “lacking” or “maladaptive,” and pushes them toward “normalisation.”
* **Disability justice paradigm:** Centres dignity, equity, inclusion, and acknowledges structural injustices (poverty, exclusion, discrimination, trauma).

#### **Narratives vs. Numbers**

* Quantitative data (prevalence, suicide rates) cannot fully capture lived suffering, which is embedded in personal histories and social contexts.
* The article argues that authentic narratives are crucial for designing meaningful care systems.

---

### **2. The News**

* The article highlights real-life accounts of individuals who experienced:

  * Childhood neglect and deprivation
  * Abuse and trauma
  * Psychiatric institutional mistreatment

* These stories underline how mental health struggles are **deeply contextual**, shaped by family structures, social inequalities, and care-system failures.

* Despite advancements such as third-generation medications and evidence-based therapies, the **mental health treatment gap remains 70%–90% globally**.

* The piece critiques current mental health practices that:

  * Over-emphasise biological/clinical models
  * Push integration into an “unchanged” society
  * Ignore structural deprivation and relational ruptures

* The authors argue for **radically reimagining mental health care** as a pursuit of dignity, contextual justice, and long-term relational support rather than symptom management alone.

---

### **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

While the article critiques broad systemic issues, relevant Indian frameworks include:

#### **Legal & Policy Framework**

* **Mental Healthcare Act, 2017 (MHCA):**

  * Guarantees rights-based mental healthcare.
  * Prohibits inhumane treatment, chaining, and arbitrary institutionalisation.
  * Stresses community-based care.

* **National Mental Health Programme (NMHP):**

  * Strengthens District Mental Health Services.
  * Promotes decentralised care and integration with primary health systems.

* **Tele-MANAS (2022):**

  * 24/7 tele-mental health helpline to enhance access.

* **NCRB suicide data system:**

  * Though limited, provides basic categorisation of causes.

#### **Gaps**

* Chronic understaffing
* Insufficient community-based rehabilitation
* Weak social welfare linkages
* Poor implementation of MHCA’s rights-based provisions

The article argues that these existing interventions **do not adequately centre context, dignity, or lived experience**.

---

### **4. Mains Relevance**

#### **Issues & Challenges**

1. **Reductionist Models**

   * Over-focus on biology ignores poverty, trauma, gender-based violence, caste oppression, and intergenerational pain.

2. **Inadequate Language and Expression**

   * Experiences of shame, alienation, abandonment are rarely given space in care settings.

3. **Structural and Material Deprivation**

   * Housing insecurity, food scarcity, unemployment shape mental distress but remain under-addressed.

4. **Professional Dominance**

   * Lived experience practitioners are undervalued despite being crucial for culturally grounded care.

5. **Fragmented and Non-Longitudinal Care**

   * Loss of engagement with services leads to relapse, homelessness, and crisis.

6. **Stigma and Power Imbalances**

   * Institutional abuse (like chaining) persists in some systems due to lack of accountability.

---

#### **Impacts & Analytical Insights**

##### **Social Impact**

* Mental health cannot be separated from family conflict, relational ruptures, discrimination, and community alienation.
* One-third of suicides in India are linked to “family problems” — signalling the relational dimension of distress.

##### **Economic Impact**

* Material deprivation both causes and worsens mental ill-health.
* Poverty, unemployment, and housing instability amplify psychological suffering.

##### **Governance & Justice Perspective**

* Care must move from symptom reduction to **relational justice** — addressing the harms society imposes.
* Sandel’s conception of justice (“what we owe each other”) becomes central to mental health ethics.

##### **Cultural & Intersectional Lens**

* Distress intersects with caste, class, gender, sexuality, and colonial histories.
* Approaches must be plural — biological, psychological, social, cultural, political, historical — not hierarchical.

---

### **5. Way Forward**

1. **Shift from Deficit Models to Contextual Care**

   * Understand distress as meaning-making within social worlds, not merely “maladaptive patterns.”

2. **Integrate Dignity and Disability Justice**

   * Ensure systems uphold rights, safety, and relational wholeness.
   * Move from “integration into normalcy” to **participation in chosen lives**.

3. **Strengthen Community-Based and Relational Work**

   * Develop long-term therapeutic alliances.
   * Invest in peer supporters and lived-experience practitioners.

4. **Address Structural Determinants**

   * Link mental health care with welfare systems: housing, food, employment, social protection.

5. **Personalised Care at Scale**

   * Combine essential protocols with narrative and contextual customisation.
   * Use implementation science to understand **what works for whom and how**.

6. **Reform Mental Health Education**

   * Train providers to handle ambiguity, listen deeply, and work with existential questions.
   * Promote transdisciplinary approaches (social sciences + medical sciences).

7. **Reorient Research Priorities**

   * Move beyond large-scale surveys to *granular*, real-world investigations.
   * Capture lived realities, relational dynamics, and context-specific variations.

8. **Institutional Accountability & Ethical Practice**

   * Strict monitoring to prevent coercion, abuse, and neglect.
   * Ensure MHCA rights are implemented uniformly.

9. **Recognition & Compensation for Lived Experience Workers**

   * Formally include community voices in care teams.
   * Pay and train them as professionals.

  * Essential drug lists,
  * Attempts to strengthen quality control.

#### **Workforce Measures**

* Post-COVID emphasis on:

  * Contracts, insurance, incentives for frontline workers,
  * But persistent issues: low wages, precarious jobs, lack of social security.

#### **Equity & Inclusion**

* Policies exist under NHM and SC/ST Sub-Plans, but implementation gaps remain in addressing:

  * Caste-based discrimination,
  * Gender inequities,
  * Rural–urban divide,
  * Barriers for LGBTQ+ persons and persons with disabilities.

# A deep cleaning of India’s electoral rolls
## **Special Intensive Revision (SIR) 2025: Why It Was Needed, How It Works, and the Constitutional Debate**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

#### **Electoral Roll Revision**

India updates its electoral rolls through two primary mechanisms:

1. **Intensive Revision**

   * Fresh, door-to-door enumeration.
   * Rebuilds the electoral roll from scratch.
   * Last major exercise: **2002–03**.

2. **Summary Revision**

   * Incremental corrections/updates.
   * Draft roll is published → public can file claims/objections.
   * Used routinely for the last two decades.

#### **Why the Rolls Need Updating**

* **Rapid migration**, urbanisation, and high mobility make the rolls outdated quickly.
* Leads to:

  * Duplicate entries
  * Dead voters still on lists
  * Missing eligible voters
  * Incorrect addresses

Without an overhaul, the integrity of elections is at stake.

Thus, **SIR 2025** became necessary to rebuild accuracy at scale.

---

### **2. The News**

* **SIR 2025**, implemented first in **Bihar (June 2025)**, triggered petitions before the Supreme Court claiming:

  * It violated universal adult franchise.
  * It forced existing voters to re-prove citizenship → potential mass deletions.
* Petitioners argued the revision was unconstitutional and targeted voters.

#### **Supreme Court Context**

* Article **324**: ECI has complete **superintendence, direction, and control** over electoral rolls.
* Article **326**: Ensures **universal adult franchise**, but only for **eligible citizens**.

Therefore, ECI is **constitutionally empowered** (and obligated) to verify eligibility independently.

The article argues the criticisms ignore the complex reality:
India lacks a *civil registry* like Germany or Canada, so ECI must do verification manually.

---

### **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

#### **ECI Steps Under SIR 2025**

* **Door-to-door verification** of all electors.
* Expanded list of acceptable documents:

  * From **4 documents in 2003** → **11 documents in 2025**.
* Allowed **Aadhaar as ID proof** (following Supreme Court suggestion).
* **BLAs of political parties** trained to increase transparency.
* **Digitisation**:

  * All documents scanned and stored electronically.
  * Forms available online.
  * Claims & objections allowed through digital platforms.
* Participation:

  * In Bihar alone: **1.6 lakh BLAs** + State Legal Services Authority volunteers assisted public.

These show a shift toward **technological accessibility**, inclusion, and procedural fairness.

---

### **4. Mains Relevance**

#### **Issues & Challenges**

1. **Constitutionality Debate**

   * Critics: SIR forces re-enumeration, risks disenfranchisement, burdens voters.
   * Supporters: ECI is duty-bound to ensure accuracy; errors harm universal adult franchise.

2. **Administrative Difficulties**

   * Screening citizenship is complex in a country with no central residency/citizenship registry.
   * High mobility (urban slums, migrant labourers) complicates address verification.

3. **Political Sensitivity**

   * Allegations of voter targeting can erode trust, even when exercises are neutral.

4. **Technological Barriers**

   * Digital processes may exclude digitally illiterate populations unless assisted.

---

#### **Impact Analysis**

##### **Strengthening Electoral Integrity**

* SIR enhances accuracy → prevents impersonation and illegal voting.
* Reaffirms ECI’s autonomy and credibility.

##### **Participation & Transparency Gains**

* BLAs and legal volunteers improve voter outreach.
* Digitisation increases accountability.

##### **Concerns About Exclusions**

* Even if legally valid, mass deletions raise fears of wrongful disenfranchisement.
* Low number of claims (36,500 vs 65 lakh deletions) could reflect:

  * Genuine accuracy of deletions, **or**
  * Lack of awareness or barriers in filing objections.

##### **International Comparison**

* Unlike many democracies with automatic voter databases, India relies on **active manual enumeration**, making SIR an essential periodic exercise.

---

### **5. Way Forward**

1. **Strengthen Public Awareness**

   * Massive communication campaigns to ensure voters understand rights and procedures.

2. **Improve Accessibility**

   * Offline + online claim filing options.
   * Use mobile vans, panchayat-level help desks.

3. **Independent Audits**

   * Third-party review of deletion lists to ensure fairness.

4. **Integrate Databases (Long-term Reform)**

   * Explore creation of a civil registry (while safeguarding privacy).
   * Inter-agency data sharing with safeguards.

5. **Continuous Roll Updating**

   * Institutionalise rolling enrolment and real-time corrections.

6. **Political Party Collaboration**

   * Continue BLA training and mandate cross-party oversight for transparency.

7. **Protect Vulnerable Groups**

   * Migrants, elderly, homeless persons, women, and marginalised communities need targeted verification support.

# Does Google’s Quantum Echoes bring Q-day closer?
## **Google’s “Quantum Echoes” Experiment & Q-Day: Understanding the Science, Risks, and Reality**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

#### **Quantum Computing Basics**

* **Qubit:** Quantum version of a classical bit, can be both 0 and 1 simultaneously (superposition).
* **Entanglement:** Qubits become linked; actions on one affect the other instantly.
* **Quantum Interference:** Allows constructive or destructive combinations of probability amplitudes to extract patterns.

These features enable quantum computers to evaluate **many possibilities at once**, unlike classical systems which check them sequentially.

#### **Why Are Quantum Echoes Important?**

* Classical physics describes how energy or particles move.
* Quantum systems are far more complex — information spreads in ways that resemble **ripples that can reverse direction**.
* This behaviour is observed by measuring **Out-of-Time-Order Correlators (OTOCs)** — used to quantify scrambling of information inside quantum matter.

---

### **2. The News: The Quantum Echoes Experiment**

* Using a **65-qubit Willow superconducting processor**, Google scientists examined how quantum information **spreads, scrambles, and then refocuses**.

#### **What Was Done?**

* Researchers **perturbed** the quantum system (like poking it microscopically).
* Allowed it to evolve.
* **Reversed the evolution**.
* Looked for an **echo** — a small signal that shows whether the disturbance has refocused.

The technique reveals:

* Speed of information spreading
* Stability of entanglement
* Internal structure of quantum matter such as superconductors, exotic phases of matter

#### **How Is This Different from the 2019 Quantum Supremacy Experiment?**

| Sycamore (2019)                                                      | Quantum Echoes (2025)                              |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Speed test: Solve a random computation faster than any supercomputer | Physics experiment: measure information scrambling |
| Claimed "quantum supremacy"                                          | Aims for **scientific reproducibility**            |
| Not easily verifiable                                                | Results **verifiable** by repeated measurements    |
| Cryptographically relevant                                           | **No cryptographic threat**                        |

The Willow experiment is **not** about breaking encryption or approaching Q-day.

---

### **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

#### **Global Actions**

* **NIST (U.S.)** has already standardised **post-quantum cryptography (PQC)**:

  * **CRYSTALS-Kyber** for encryption
  * **CRYSTALS-Dilithium** for digital signatures
* Expected to become global standards.

#### **India’s Response**

* **RBI advisory:** Urging banks and fintech companies to transition to quantum-safe systems before the end of the decade.
* National strategies under MeitY and QKD (Quantum Key Distribution) initiatives.
* Integration of PQC in digital public infrastructure is underway.

---

### **4. Mains Relevance**

#### **Issues & Challenges**

1. **Misunderstanding of Quantum Experiments**

   * Public often conflates advances like Quantum Echoes with cryptographic threats.
   * But this study is about physics, not computation.

2. **Q-Day Anxiety**

   * Q-day: the moment a quantum computer can break RSA-2048 encryption.
   * But current hardware is **nowhere close** to required qubit counts.

3. **Technological Gaps**

   * Present processors (Google Willow, IBM Condor): few hundred noisy qubits.
   * Needed for RSA-2048: **millions of logical qubits**, plus error correction.

4. **Security Risks Outside Q-Day**

   * **Harvest now, decrypt later** attacks:

     * Adversaries store encrypted data today.
     * Decrypt it once powerful quantum machines exist.
   * Requires early adoption of PQC.

5. **Scientific vs. Cryptographic Progress**

   * Shor’s algorithm advances computational factoring.
   * Quantum Echoes advances understanding of **quantum dynamics**.
   * Both use quantum hardware, but with **entirely different goals**.

---

### **5. Way Forward**

1. **Accelerate Adoption of PQC**

   * Update digital systems (banking, health, governance, defence) to NIST-approved quantum-safe algorithms.
   * Mandate phased migration in critical infrastructure.

2. **Strengthen India’s Quantum Ecosystem**

   * Expand the National Quantum Mission.
   * Invest in superconducting qubits, photonic qubits, ion traps.
   * Build indigenous PQC implementation expertise.

3. **Public Awareness & Risk Communication**

   * Clarify that physics experiments like Quantum Echoes **do not** threaten cybersecurity.
   * Promote understanding of Q-day as a **long-term** possibility.

4. **Support Industry Transition**

   * Provide guidelines and auditing frameworks for quantum-resilient encryption.
   * Encourage hybrid cryptography systems (classical + PQC).

5. **Global Collaboration**

   * Work with NIST, ETSI, ISO, and other bodies on PQC standards.
   * Share research outputs on quantum dynamics and materials science.

6. **Continue Long-Horizon Research**

   * Experiments on quantum information flow (like OTOC measurements) deepen scientific knowledge needed for:

     * Fault tolerance
     * Better qubit designs
     * Quantum error correction

---

### **Conclusion**

Google’s **Quantum Echoes** experiment is a major scientific achievement in understanding **how quantum information behaves**, not a step toward breaking encryption. Q-day remains a **5–8 year theoretical horizon**, requiring millions of logical qubits — far beyond current technology.
Meanwhile, the world — including India — must proactively shift to **quantum-safe cryptography** to future-proof critical data and infrastructure.

# Value of water: evaluating the pricelessness of clean, potable water
## **Valuing Clean Water in Low-Income Settings: Insights from an Odisha RCT on WTP–WTA**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

#### **Why Water Access Matters**

* Water has **no substitute** and is essential for life, health, productivity, and dignity.
* Globally, only **30%** in low-income countries and **14%** of rural residents have reliable access to potable water.
* India faces similar gaps, especially in States with poor piped-water coverage.

#### **Traditional Ways of Studying Water Access**

Earlier research measured water valuation **indirectly** through:

* Adoption of chlorine/filters
* Time spent collecting water
* Take-up of piped water
* Hedonic pricing of water-access amenities

However, these methods **bundle non-monetary costs** (collection time, labour, taste, unreliability) with valuation, **underestimating** how much households truly value clean water.

#### **New Approach**

The Odisha study directly delivered **clean, home-delivered water** to households to isolate:

* Pure valuation of clean water
* Actual willingness to pay (WTP)
* Willingness to accept compensation (WTA)

This allows a more accurate measure of how low-income households value water quality **without burdens attached**.

---

### **2. The News**

* Conducted in **160 villages** in Odisha; successful implementation in **99 villages** served by private water-treatment facilities.

* The study was a **randomised controlled trial (RCT)** with three experimental arms:

  1. **Price Arm** – households could buy clean water at subsidised prices → revealed WTP and price sensitivity.
  2. **Free-Water Arm** – no financial constraints → revealed unconstrained demand.
  3. **Exchangeable Entitlement Arm** – households could choose **water or equivalent cash** → revealed WTA and preference stability.

* Randomisation ensured differences arose from treatment design, not geography or access.

---

### **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

#### **National Schemes**

* **Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM):** aims for universal household tap-water supply; Odisha remains behind national averages.
* **Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM):** addresses sanitation–water linkages.
* **National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP):** funds village-level systems.
* **State-specific schemes** often supplement national programmes.

#### **Challenges**

* Uneven infrastructure
* Treatment burden shifted to households
* Seasonal shortages
* Urban–rural disparities
* Poor water quality monitoring

This study provides evidence useful for **designing targeted subsidies, decentralised systems, entitlement frameworks, and state-level reforms**.

---

### **4. Mains Relevance**

#### **Issues & Challenges Highlighted**

1. **Underestimation of True Water Value**

   * Prior studies misinterpreted low adoption of chlorine/filters as low valuation of water quality.
   * Actually, households dislike **taste issues, inconvenience, labour, irregular supply**, not cleanliness itself.

2. **WTP–WTA Gap**

   * WTP was higher than expected.
   * WTA was extremely high — people were unwilling to give up clean water even for cash → indicates psychological value and risk aversion.

3. **Equity Concerns**

   * Collection burdens disproportionately affect women and girls.
   * Reliance on unsafe sources perpetuates health inequities.

4. **Behavioural Shifts**

   * Clean water delivery reduced dependence on unreliable sources.
   * Collection time dropped significantly.
   * Self-reported health improved (though objective data would strengthen findings).

5. **Policy Implications**

   * People value water quality much more when **access constraints** are removed.
   * Clean water is a **necessity good** — demand does not fall sharply with price.

---

### **5. Way Forward**

1. **Decentralised Home Delivery in No-Pipe Zones**

   * Interim supply models using tankers, community RO units, or private–public delivery partnerships.

2. **Subsidy Design Based on True WTP**

   * Data-driven pricing to balance affordability and financial sustainability.
   * Tiered subsidy systems for vulnerable groups.

3. **Entitlement-Based Models**

   * Households can redeem water or equivalent benefits, ensuring choices for the poorest.
   * Useful in tribal/remote areas where infrastructure is slow to expand.

4. **Reduce Non-Monetary Burdens**

   * Improve reliability, taste, convenience, and predictability of supply.
   * Minimise labour and time costs for women.

5. **Behavioural Messaging**

   * Highlight health benefits of clean water → reinforces WTA–WTP insights.

6. **Integrate With Long-Term Infrastructure Goals**

   * Continue expanding piped-water supply under JJM.
   * Use decentralised systems as transition mechanisms.

7. **Monitor Outcomes**

   * Combine self-reported health with objective measures (water testing, clinic records).

8. **Strengthen Local Governance**

   * Train panchayats for water-quality management.
   * Adopt community-led monitoring models.

---

### **Conclusion**

The Odisha experiment fundamentally reframes how we understand demand for clean water. It shows that **households care deeply about water quality**, but earlier estimates were distorted by the burdens of acquisition and treatment. By isolating water quality from inconvenience, the study demonstrates high willingness to pay, even higher willingness to accept, and strong behavioural shifts — valuable evidence for **equitable, efficient, and people-centred drinking water policy** in India and other low-income settings.
