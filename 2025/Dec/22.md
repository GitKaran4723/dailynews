# Watching crisis in Bangladesh closely: India
## India–Bangladesh Diplomatic Tensions over Minority Safety (December 2025)

---

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

**India–Bangladesh relations**

* India and **Bangladesh** share close historical, cultural, economic, and strategic ties.
* Cooperation spans **trade, connectivity, counter-terrorism, water sharing, and people-to-people exchanges**.
* However, **minority safety**, especially of **Hindus in Bangladesh**, has been a **recurring sensitive issue**.

**Minority protection in international relations**

* Protection of minorities is **primarily a sovereign responsibility** of the concerned State.
* But **neighbouring countries often raise concerns diplomatically** when there is:

  * Risk of spillover tensions
  * Human rights implications
  * Impact on bilateral relations

**Diplomatic law**

* Under the **Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations**, host countries must **ensure safety of foreign missions and diplomats**, regardless of protests or political tensions.

---

### 2. **The News**

* India strongly condemned the **lynching of Dipu Chandra Das**, a 25-year-old Hindu youth in **Mymensingh, Bangladesh**.
* India termed it a **“horrendous and barbaric act”** and raised **concerns about the safety of minorities**.
* **Randhir Jaiswal**, spokesperson of India’s **Ministry of External Affairs**, said:

  * India is closely monitoring the situation
  * Bangladesh authorities have been urged to **bring perpetrators to justice**
* Bangladesh responded through **Touhid Hossein**, stating:

  * The incident should not be communalised
  * Arrests have already been made
  * Such crimes occur in all South Asian countries
* Tensions also arose after:

  * Protests outside the **Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi**
  * Closure of Indian Visa Application Centres (IVACs) in Bangladesh due to security concerns

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Diplomatic Actions**

**India**

* Raised the issue **through diplomatic channels**

# President grants assent to rural jobs Bill; Centre lists its four focus areas
## Viksit Bharat – Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Act, 2025

*(Replacing MGNREGA)*

---

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

**What was MGNREGA?**

* The **Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act** (2005) is a **rights-based law**.
* It legally guaranteed:

  * **100 days of wage employment** per rural household
  * **Unemployment allowance** if work was not provided
* Objective:

  * Income security
  * Creation of durable rural assets
  * Social inclusion (women, SC/ST participation)

**Nature of MGNREGA**

* Demand-driven
* Decentralised (Gram Panchayat as implementing authority)
* Transparency tools: social audit, muster rolls, DBT

---

### 2. **The News**

* **Droupadi Murmu** has given **assent** to the **Viksit Bharat – Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Act**.
* This Act **replaces MGNREGA**.
* Key highlights announced by the government:

  * Guaranteed workdays increased from **100 → 125 days**
  * Total budget allocation: **₹1,51,282 crore**
  * Focus shifts from *“creating works”* to *“creating outcomes”*
* Union Minister **Shivraj Singh Chouhan** defended the law amid criticism, stating:

  * Unemployment allowance provisions are strengthened
  * Penalties introduced for delayed wage payments

---

### 3. **Structural Changes under VB-G Ram G**

**Key Shifts**

* **Rights-based → Outcome-based orientation**
* Greater emphasis on **measurable rural transformation**

**Four Focus Areas**

1. **Water security**

   * Watershed development
   * Water harvesting structures
2. **Core rural infrastructure**

   * Roads, common assets, connectivity
3. **Livelihood-related infrastructure**

   * Support to agriculture, allied activities
4. **Extreme weather mitigation**

   * Climate-resilient rural assets

**Funding Pattern**

* Centre–State sharing remains **60:40**
* Centre continues as **principal funding partner**

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance (GS-II & GS-III)**

#### Positives / Government’s Argument

* Increase in guaranteed employment days → better income support
* Stronger penalty & unemployment allowance provisions
* Focus on:

  * Climate resilience
  * Durable and productive assets
* Alignment with **Viksit Bharat** vision and rural transformation

#### Concerns / Criticism

* Dilution of **rights-based character** of MGNREGA
* Greater centralisation → reduced role of Panchayats
* Ambiguity on:

  * Demand-driven nature
  * Legal enforceability of employment guarantee
* Risk of shifting from **social security** to **project-based implementation**

#### Analytical Angle (UPSC-ready)

* MGNREGA was not just an employment scheme but a **rural safety net**.
* VB-G Ram G represents a **philosophical shift**:

  * From *welfare entitlement* → *developmental instrument*
* Core question:

  > Can outcome orientation coexist with legal employment guarantee?

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

* Retain **legal enforceability** of employment guarantee
* Ensure **Gram Panchayat autonomy** in planning & execution
* Strong **social audit mechanisms** must continue
* Transparent outcome metrics without undermining inclusivity
* Balance:

  * **Efficiency + equity**
  * **Development + social justice**

# Centre rejects mining push charge behind Aravalli definition
## Aravalli Hills Definition Controversy & Mining Concerns

---

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

**What are the Aravallis?**

* The **Aravalli Range** is one of the **oldest fold mountain systems in the world**.
* Extends from **Gujarat → Rajasthan → Haryana → Delhi**.
* Ecological importance:

  * Acts as a **barrier against desertification** from the Thar Desert
  * Supports **groundwater recharge**
  * Regulates **local climate**
  * Hosts forests, wildlife corridors, and biodiversity

**Why are Aravallis sensitive?**

* Excessive mining leads to:

  * Loss of forest cover
  * Groundwater depletion
  * Increased air pollution
  * Expansion of desert conditions
* Hence, mining in Aravallis has been a **long-standing legal and environmental issue**.

---

### 2. **The News**

* The Union Government rejected claims that the **new definition of Aravalli Hills** will allow **large-scale mining**.
* The Centre asserted that:

  * **Over 90% of the Aravalli region will remain protected**
  * Only **0.19% of the total 1.44 lakh sq km area** may be eligible for mining, subject to safeguards
* **Bhupender Yadav** said:

  * No dilution of protection norms
  * Allegations of destruction are **misinformation**
* The **Supreme Court of India**, on **20 November 2025**, accepted:

  * A **MoEFCC committee’s recommendations**
  * A **court-approved framework** for defining Aravalli Hills and Ranges
* Importantly:

  * There is a **freeze on new mining leases** until a **Comprehensive Management Plan** is finalised

---

### 3. **New Definition of Aravalli (Court-Approved)**

**Aravalli Hill**

* Any landform:

  * Located in **designated Aravalli districts**
  * With **elevation ≥ 100 metres above local relief**

**Aravalli Range**

* A group of:

  * **Two or more Aravalli hills**
  * Located within **500 metres of each other**

**Government Clarification**

* Landforms **below 100 metres are NOT automatically open for mining**
* Protection depends on:

  * Forest laws
  * Environmental clearance rules
  * Supreme Court restrictions

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance (GS-III: Environment & Ecology)**

#### Core Issues

* **Environmental protection vs developmental pressures**
* Judicial intervention in ecological governance
* Scientific definitions influencing policy outcomes

#### Government’s Argument

* Scientific, objective definition brings **clarity**
* Strengthens protection by:

  * Clearly identifying vulnerable landforms
  * Freezing new mining activities
* Enables preparation of a **region-wide management plan**

#### Concerns Raised

* Narrow definition may:

  * Exclude ecologically important low-lying areas
  * Enable future policy dilution
* Trust deficit due to:

  * Past instances of illegal mining
  * Weak enforcement at state levels

#### Analytical Balance (UPSC-friendly)

* Definitions matter, but **implementation matters more**
* Aravallis require:

  * Landscape-level protection, not piecemeal regulation
* Judiciary remains a **key environmental sentinel** in India

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

* Finalise and implement the **Comprehensive Aravalli Management Plan**
* Integrate:

  * Forest conservation
  * Groundwater protection
  * Climate resilience strategies
* Strengthen:

  * Satellite monitoring of mining
  * Independent environmental audits
* Cooperative federalism:

  * Centre–State coordination (Rajasthan, Haryana, Delhi)
* Community participation in conservation

* Risks:

  * Economic slowdown
  * Protectionism
  * Geopolitical unpredictability

**Africa as diversification strategy**

* Growing demand
* Under-penetrated by Indian MSMEs
* Less saturated compared to Western markets

**China comparison (Reality check)**

* China–Africa trade: **>$200 billion**
* China accounts for:

  * ~21% of Africa’s imports
* Around **33%** of Chinese exports fall under:

  * HSN 84 & 85 (machinery, electronics, semiconductors)
    → Reflects **China’s industrial depth**, which India must catch up to.

---

### 4. **Five-Pillar Strategy for India–Africa Trade Expansion**

* Negotiate:

  * Preferential Trade Agreements (PTAs)
  * Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreements (CEPAs)
* Engage regional blocs:

  * **African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA)**

#### **Pillar 2: Move Up the Value Chain**

* Shift from:

  * Low-value commodity exports → value-added manufacturing
* Promote:

  * Joint ventures
  * Cross-border manufacturing
* Advantage:

  * Manufacturing in Africa gives:

    * Preferential access to US/EU markets

#### **Pillar 3: MSMEs & Trade Finance**

* Africa = high-potential market for **Indian MSMEs**
* Needed reforms:

  * Scale up Lines of Credit
  * Easier trade finance access
  * Local currency trade
  * Joint insurance pools for political & commercial risk
* This reduces perceived risk for:

  * MSMEs
  * Banks

#### **Pillar 4: Logistics & Connectivity**

* Reduce freight costs by:

  * Port modernisation
  * Hinterland connectivity
  * India–Africa maritime corridors
* Connectivity is key to competitiveness.

#### **Pillar 5: Services, Digital & People-to-People Links**

* Leverage India’s strengths:

  * IT & digital services

# Lessons from China on tackling pollution
## Why Beijing Breathes Easier While Delhi Chokes

*(Comparative Governance of Air Pollution: China vs India)*

---

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

**What is PM2.5?**

* Fine particulate matter **≤ 2.5 microns** in diameter.
* Penetrates deep into lungs and bloodstream.
* Causes:

  * Respiratory diseases
  * Cardiovascular problems
  * Premature deaths
* WHO guideline: **≤ 5 µg/m³ (annual mean)**.

**Why compare Beijing and Delhi?**

* Both are:

  * Mega cities
  * High population density
  * Surrounded by industrial & agricultural regions
* Yet outcomes diverged sharply:

  * **Beijing** → dramatic improvement
  * **Delhi** → persistent severe pollution

---

### 2. **The News / Core Issue**

* **Beijing** reduced PM2.5 levels:

  * **102 µg/m³ (2013)** → **31 µg/m³ (2024)**
* **Delhi** continues to rank among the **most polluted cities globally**.
* Key question:

  > *What explains Beijing’s clean-air turnaround, and why has Delhi struggled?*

---

### 3. **Beijing’s Clean-Air Transformation**

**Key Policy Drives**

* **Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan**
* **Blue Sky Protection Campaign**

**Core Features of Beijing’s Strategy**

#### (a) Coherent, Top-down Governance

* Central government set **clear targets**
* Local governments held **directly accountable**

#### (b) Strict Enforcement

* Shutdown/relocation of **hundreds of polluting industries**
* Replacement of **coal-fired boilers** with natural gas
* Heavy penalties for non-compliance

#### (c) Transport & Energy Transition

* Rapid expansion of **electric mobility**
* Adoption of **China VI emission standards**
* Massive investments in **clean energy**

#### (d) Real-time Monitoring

#### (e) Regional Coordination (Airshed Model)

* Unified strategy across:

  * Beijing
  * Tianjin
  * Hebei
* Tackled **transboundary pollution**

➡️ **Result:** Sustained, long-term reduction in pollution — not seasonal firefighting.

---

### 4. **India’s Approach: Laws Without Outcomes**

**Strong Legal Framework Exists**

* **Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act**
* **Environment Protection Act**
* Supporting laws:

  * Factories Act, 1948
  * Motor Vehicles Act, 1988
* Institutions:

  * Courts, tribunals, pollution control boards
  * **Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM)**

**Major Initiatives Taken**

* National Clean Air Programme (NCAP)
* Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP)
* Odd-even scheme
* Construction bans
* Crop-residue management
* Delhi Air Pollution Mitigation Plan 2025

**Key Problem**

* **Fragmentation & reactivity**
* Measures activate **only during pollution peaks**
* Agencies function in **silos**

---

### 5. **Core Difference: Governance & Capacity**

| Aspect                 | Beijing               | Delhi               |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------- |
| Governance             | Centralised, vertical | Fragmented          |
| Enforcement            | Strict, swift         | Weak, delayed       |
| Accountability         | Clear hierarchy       | Diffused            |
| Regional approach      | Strong airshed        | Limited authority   |
| Institutional capacity | Well-funded           | Understaffed boards |

**China’s Environmental Vertical Reform**

* Created a **clear command chain**
* Ensured uniform implementation

**Delhi’s Reality**

* Multiple actors:

  * Union Government
  * Delhi Government
  * CPCB, DPCC
  * Municipal bodies
* Result:

  * Slow decisions
  * Weak enforcement
  * Blurred responsibility

---

### 6. **Structural Challenges in Delhi**

* Inter-State coordination on stubble burning

---

### 8. **Mains Relevance (GS-III: Environment & Governance)**

**Key Themes**

* Environmental governance
* Federal coordination
* Urban sustainability
* Public health policy

**UPSC-ready line**

> “India’s air pollution crisis is not a failure of law, but a failure of governance, enforcement, and regional coordination.”
