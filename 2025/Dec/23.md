## **India–Russia Relations amid Global Flux (Putin’s India Visit)**

---

### **1. Basic Understanding**

**India–Russia relationship: core nature**

* India and Russia share a **Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership**.
* The relationship is built on:

  * **Mutual trust**
  * **Respect for core national interests**
  * **Long-term strategic autonomy**
* It is often described metaphorically as **“The Elephant and the Bear”** — two civilisational powers acting independently of Western pressure.

**Why India–Russia ties matter for UPSC**

* Defence preparedness
* Energy security
* Strategic autonomy
* Multipolar world order
* Balance between West–Russia–China equations

---

### **2. The News**

* **Vladimir Putin visited India on December 4–5 for the 23rd India–Russia Annual Summit.**
* This was his **first visit after the West imposed diplomatic embargoes** following the **Russia-Ukraine War**.
* The visit attracted global attention because:

  * India refused to isolate Russia.
  * The West wanted to see whether India would dilute ties.
* Outcome:

  * India maintained a **carefully balanced posture**.
  * Strategic autonomy was preserved without openly antagonising the West.

---

### **3. Historical Depth of India–Russia Ties**

#### **1971 Turning Point**

* **India-Soviet Treaty of Peace, Friendship and Cooperation**
* Leaders involved:

  * **Indira Gandhi**
  * **Leonid Brezhnev**
* Impact:

  * Altered South Asian geopolitics.
  * Enabled India to defeat Pakistan.
  * Led to the creation of **Bangladesh**.

#### **Post-Cold War Continuity**

* Relationship strengthened after the Gorbachev era.
* Under **Putin’s long presidency**, ties became more institutionalised.
* Example:

  * 2009: Russia waived penalties to help India acquire its **second aircraft carrier** during **Manmohan Singh’s** tenure.

---

### **4. India’s Stand on Ukraine War**

* India followed:

  * **Neutrality**
  * **Dialogue and diplomacy**
  * **National interest-based foreign policy**
* India refused to:

  * Join Western sanctions.
  * Publicly condemn Russia.
* This caused:

  * Friction with the U.S. and EU.
  * Pressure on India’s strategic choices.

---

### **5. The Joint Statement: Key Signals**

* Reaffirmed:

  * 25 years of Strategic Partnership.
  * Longstanding trust and mutual respect.
* Focus areas highlighted:

  * Connectivity
  * Technology and industrial cooperation
  * Transport corridors:

    * Northern Sea Route (Arctic)
    * Chennai–Vladivostok Eastern Maritime Corridor
* **Notable absence**:

  * Explicit mention of **defence cooperation**.

---

### **6. Defence Dimension – The Silent Shift?**

**Why defence matters**

* Defence cooperation has been the **bedrock** of India–Russia ties.

**Major Russian contributions to India’s defence**

* **S-400 missile defence system**
* **BrahMos missile**
* **Sukhoi Su-30MKI**
* **T-90 tanks**
* Transport helicopters and joint manufacturing projects.

**Recent concern**

* Defence was **absent from the Joint Statement**, raising questions:

  * Tactical silence to avoid Western backlash?
  * Gradual diversification away from Russia?
* India has diversified procurement to:

  * France
  * Israel
  * Others
    → but Russia remains **most reliable historically**.

---

### **7. Western Reliability: A Counterpoint**

* The U.S. recently approved:

  * **$686 million package** to modernise Pakistan’s F-16 fleet.
  * Additional $400 million upgrade earlier.
* This comes despite claims that:

  * U.S.–India ties define the 21st century.
* This reinforces India’s belief that:

  * The West is **interest-driven and inconsistent**.
  * Russia has been **steadfast in crises**.

---

### **8. Mains Relevance (GS Paper II & III)**

#### **Strategic Autonomy**

* India demonstrates:

  * Issue-based alignment.
  * Freedom from bloc politics.

#### **Multipolar World**

* India–Russia ties contribute to:

  * Erosion of unipolar dominance.
  * Strategic balance in Eurasia.

#### **Defence & Security**

* Over-dependence on the West may:

  * Increase vulnerability.
  * Restrict technology access.
* Russia offers:

  * Fewer political conditions.
  * Joint development opportunities.

---

### **9. Way Forward**

* Maintain **balanced diversification**, not abrupt shifts.
* Preserve defence cooperation while expanding new partnerships.
* Use silence strategically, not as abandonment.
* Strengthen indigenous defence under *Atmanirbhar Bharat* using:

  * Russian collaboration.
  * Western technology selectively.
* Continue principled neutrality in global conflicts.

# Step up
## **Supreme Court on CSR & Environmental Responsibility (Great Indian Bustard Case)**

---

### **1. Basic Understanding**

**What is Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)?**

* CSR is mandated under the **Companies Act, 2013** (Section 135).
* Companies meeting certain financial thresholds must spend **at least 2% of average net profits** on specified social activities.
* Traditionally viewed as:

  * A **compliance-based obligation**
  * Often treated like **corporate charity**, not a constitutional duty.

**What is the Great Indian Bustard (GIB)?**

* One of the **heaviest flying birds in the world**.
* Critically endangered species.
* Habitat: arid and semi-arid grasslands of western India.
* Major threat:

  * **Overhead power transmission lines** causing frequent collisions.

---

### **2. The News**

* On **December 19**, a Supreme Court Bench delivered a landmark judgment.
* The case relates to the protection of the **Great Indian Bustard**.
* The Court held that:

  * **Environmental responsibility is inherent within CSR**.
  * Corporations, as legal persons, have a **constitutional duty** to protect the environment.
* This reframes CSR from:

  * A discretionary or charitable activity
    👉 to an **enforceable legal and constitutional obligation**.

---

### **3. Constitutional & Legal Basis Used by the Court**

#### **Article 51A(g) – Fundamental Duty**

* Imposes a duty on **every citizen**:

  * To protect and improve the natural environment.
* The Court ruled that:

  * **Corporations are legal persons**.
  * Therefore, they too share this duty.

👉 **Key innovation**:
CSR spending on environmental protection = **discharge of constitutional duty**, not charity.

#### **Companies Act, 2013**

* The Court interpreted CSR provisions purposively.
* It read **wildlife and environmental protection into CSR objectives**.

---

### **4. Background: Supreme Court’s Bustard Protection Efforts**

#### **2021 Interim Order**

* Restricted overhead transmission lines across **~99,000 sq. km** of bustard habitat.
* Ordered:

  * Undergrounding of power lines where feasible.
  * Formation of a technical committee.

#### **2024 Development**

* Court constituted an **expert committee** to:

  * Balance:

    * Bustard conservation
    * Renewable energy expansion
    * Climate commitments

#### **2025 Judgment (Current)**

* Operationalised the committee-based approach.
* Shifted from:

  * Large blanket zones
    👉 to **priority habitat areas** with detailed planning.

---

### **5. Significance of the Judgment**

#### **For Environmental Jurisprudence**

* Treats CSR as:

  * **Enforceable obligation**
  * Linked directly to constitutional values.
* Strengthens the principle of:

  * **Polluter Pays**
  * **Corporate accountability**

#### **For Wildlife Conservation**

* Provides a stronger legal basis to:

  * Demand corporate financing for:

    * Breeding and release of bustard chicks
    * Grassland restoration
    * Long-term habitat maintenance
* Especially relevant where:

  * Corporate infrastructure causes ecological harm.

#### **For Renewable Energy Policy**

* Reduces direct conflict by:

  * Narrowing priority zones.
  * Avoiding blanket bans.
* Encourages **technological solutions** (undergrounding, rerouting).

---

### **6. Limitations & Concerns**

* The judgment is **interpretative**, not operational:

  * Does not specify:

    * Which company pays
    * How much
    * Timelines
    * Audit mechanisms
* Enforcement still depends on:

  * Existing CSR penalty provisions.
* Ecological challenges remain:

  * Bustards are **mobile species**.
  * Risk areas may lie outside mapped zones.
* Success depends on:

  * Administrative capacity of governments.
  * Speed of infrastructure modification.
  * Translation of CSR funds into real outcomes.

---

### **7. Mains Relevance (GS Paper II & III)**

#### **GS II – Polity & Governance**

* Expands meaning of:

  * Fundamental Duties.
* Judicial interpretation of economic law with constitutional values.
* Role of judiciary in environmental governance.

#### **GS III – Environment & Economy**

* Wildlife conservation vs infrastructure development.
* CSR as a tool for sustainable development.
* Aligning climate action with biodiversity protection.

---

### **8. Way Forward**

* Develop **clear CSR guidelines** for environmental harm-based spending.
* Create:

  * Transparent audit and monitoring mechanisms.
* Integrate:

  * CSR funds with national conservation programmes.
* Improve:

  * Scientific habitat mapping and dynamic risk assessment.
* Strengthen coordination between:

  * Courts, governments, utilities, and corporates.

# Right to Disconnect: Drawing the line after work
## **Right to Disconnect Bill – Labour Law in the Digital Age**

---

### **1. Basic Understanding**

**What is the Right to Disconnect?**

* It is the **right of employees to not engage with work-related communications** (calls, emails, messages) **outside prescribed working hours**.
* Emerged due to:

  * Smartphones, emails, remote work
  * Blurring of **work time and personal time**
* Objective:

  * Protect **mental health, dignity, and autonomy** of workers.

**Context in India**

* India recently consolidated labour laws into **four labour codes**, focusing on:

  * Working hours
  * Overtime
  * Employer control
* These laws are largely designed for **physical workplaces**, not digital labour.

👉 The Right to Disconnect Bill is introduced as a **Private Member’s Bill** (rarely enacted), but **symbolically important**.

---

### **2. The News**

* The **Right to Disconnect Bill** has been introduced in Parliament.
* It provides employees:

  * A right **not to respond** to work-related digital communication beyond working hours.
* The Bill comes at a time when:

  * Work increasingly extends beyond offices.
  * Labour law still regulates work mainly through **time-based constructs**.
* It marks a **pivotal moment** by acknowledging digital overreach into personal life.

---

### **3. Core Legal Ambiguity: What is ‘Work’?**

#### **The Missing Definition**

* Indian labour law **does not clearly define “work” in a digital economy**.
* The Bill regulates **communication**, but:

  * Does not clarify whether after-hours emails/calls = “work”.

#### **Interaction with Existing Labour Codes**

* The **Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020** governs:

  * Working hours
  * Overtime
* But:

  * The Bill does not clarify whether digital engagement after hours counts as:

    * Working time
    * Overtime
* Result:

  * A **conceptual gap**:

    * Communication is regulated
    * But not integrated into working-time law

👉 Hence, the right functions more like a **behavioural norm**, not a **binding labour standard**.

---

### **4. Comparative Perspective (Learning, Not Replication)**

#### **European Union**

* Focus is on **employer control**, not physical activity.
* Judicial precedents expanded “working time” to include:

  * On-call duty
  * Standby periods
  * Availability under employer control
* Core principle:

  * **If the employer controls the employee’s time, it is work**.

#### **France**

* Does not redefine “work”.
* Clearly demarcates:

  * Working time
  * Rest time
* Periods of availability under employer control = working time.
* Right to disconnect implemented via:

  * Collective bargaining
  * Integration into working-time law.

#### **Germany**

* Strict enforcement of:

  * Maximum working hours
  * Mandatory rest periods
* Digital communication is governed within this framework.

**Key Comparative Question:**
👉 *When does an employee’s time belong to the employer?*

---

### **5. Mandatory Right or Contractual Right?**

* Indian labour law contains:

  * **Mandatory rules** (statutory limits on hours)
  * **Contractual terms** (employer policies, agreements)
* The Bill does **not clarify**:

  * Whether the right to disconnect is:

    * A **non-negotiable labour standard**
    * Or a **right that can be diluted by contract**
* This ambiguity can:

  * Weaken enforcement
  * Lead to unequal bargaining outcomes.

---

### **6. Constitutional Dimension**

#### **Link with Article 21**

* The right to disconnect is closely linked to:

  * Personal liberty
  * Privacy
  * Dignity
  * Mental health
* All are part of **Article 21 (Right to Life and Personal Liberty)**.

#### **What the Bill Fails to Do**

* It does not:

  * Trace its constitutional basis
  * Clarify whether the right is:

    * Purely statutory
    * Or an extension of constitutional autonomy
* Leaves open:

  * Judicial interpretation
  * Fragmented jurisprudence

---

### **7. Mains Relevance**

#### **GS Paper II – Polity & Governance**

* Interface between:

  * Fundamental Rights (Article 21)
  * Labour legislation
* Role of legislature vs judiciary in recognising new rights.

#### **GS Paper III – Economy & Labour**

* Digital economy and labour regulation
* Changing nature of work
* Occupational health and productivity.

#### **Ethics (GS IV)**

* Work-life balance
* Employer responsibility
* Human dignity in workplaces.

---

### **8. Way Forward**

* Clearly define **digital work** in labour law.
* Integrate:

  * After-hours digital engagement
  * Into working time and overtime provisions.
* Clarify:

  * Whether the right is mandatory or negotiable.
* Explicitly recognise:

  * The constitutional basis under Article 21.
* Encourage:

  * Collective bargaining
  * Sector-specific guidelines.
* Shift labour law from:

  * Physical workplace model
    👉 to **control-and-time-based digital model**.

---

### **9. Conclusion (UPSC-ready)**

The Right to Disconnect Bill rightly acknowledges that digital technologies have dissolved the boundary between work and personal life. However, by failing to define “work”, integrate digital labour into existing working-time laws, and clarify its constitutional character, the Bill remains an incomplete response. It should be seen not as a final solution, but as the **starting point of a broader transformation in Indian labour law jurisprudence**, which must eventually reconcile digital work with dignity, autonomy, and constitutional values.

## **Viksit Bharat – Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Act, 2025**

---

### **1. Basic Understanding**

**Right to Life and Livelihood**

* **Article 21** guarantees the Right to Life.
* In **Olga Tellis v. Bombay Municipal Corporation**, the Supreme Court held:

  * **Right to livelihood is an integral part of the Right to Life**.
* This jurisprudence laid the moral–constitutional foundation for **right-based employment laws**.

**MGNREGA’s Philosophy**

* **Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act**:

  * Recognised **right to work** as a condition for dignified life.
  * Converted welfare into **justiciable rights**, enforceable by law.
* Rooted in:

  * **Gandhian decentralisation** (Gram Swaraj)
  * **Ambedkarite rights-based empowerment**

---

### **2. The News**

* The **Viksit Bharat – Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Act, 2025 (VB-G RAM G Act)**:

  * Replaces MGNREGA.
  * Has received **Presidential assent**.
* It marks a **structural shift**:

  * From **demand-driven, rights-based employment**
  * To a **centrally determined, allocation-based framework**.

---

### **3. What Made MGNREGA Unique? (Why It Mattered)**

#### **Rights-Based Design**

MGNREGA guaranteed:

* Work on demand.
* Unemployment allowance if work not provided in 15 days.
* Wages within 15 days + delay compensation.
* Minimum wages & gender parity.
* Legal accountability of the State.

#### **Five Major Outcomes**

1. **Universal (not targeted)** – reduced exclusion.
2. **Higher rural incomes** – fall in poverty levels.
3. **Gender & caste equity**:

   * ~58% women participation (last 5 years).
   * 45% women were previously unpaid or underemployed.
4. **Quality assets**:

   * Water conservation, land development, drought proofing.
5. **Community empowerment**:

   * Strengthened **73rd Constitutional Amendment** institutions (PRIs).

**Evidence of Impact**

* Decline in moneylender dependence by **21%** (India Human Development Survey).
* Improved school enrolment.
* Praised by the **World Bank** as a “stellar example” (2014).
* Acted as a **shock absorber during COVID-19**.

---

### **4. Chronic Problems Before Repeal**

* Persistent **underfunding** → wage delays.
* Work rationing due to budget ceilings.
* Exclusion from:

  * Tech-heavy systems (attendance apps, complex payments).
* Weak implementation of **social audits**.
* Staff shortages → corruption opportunities.

👉 These problems weakened implementation **without questioning the core rights-based design**.

---

### **5. What Does the New VB-G RAM G Act Change?**

#### **(a) From Demand-Driven to Command-Driven**

* **Section 5(1)**:

  * Union government decides **where, what, and how** works will happen.
* **Section 4(5)**:

  * “State-wise normative allocations” based on “objective parameters”.
* Impact:

  * States lose autonomy.
  * Panchayats marginalised.
  * Employment no longer guaranteed on demand.

#### **(b) Fiscal Federalism Concerns**

* Funding pattern shifted:

  * From **90:10 (Centre:State)**
  * To **60:40** for most States.
* States must bear:

  * Any expenditure beyond their allocation.
* Risks:

  * Political favouritism.
  * Fiscal stress on poorer States.
  * Suppression of work demand → distress migration.

---

### **6. Legal & Constitutional Regression**

* In **Swaraj Abhiyan v. Union of India**, the Court:

  * Held Centre liable for wage delays.
* New Act:

  * Removes explicit obligation on Centre for payment delays.
* Result:

  * **Erosion of justiciability**.
  * Rights diluted into discretionary entitlements.

---

### **7. Social Justice Concerns**

#### **Seasonal Employment Restriction**

* **Section 6(2)**:

  * No employment for 60 days during agricultural season.
* Consequences:

  * Harms landless labourers.
  * Disadvantages women.
  * Reinforces caste and land inequalities.

#### **125 Days Claim – A Mirage**

* While the Act promises 125 days:

  * Current average employment ≈ **50 days/year**.
* Without assured funding:

  * The promise lacks credibility.

#### **No New Anti-Corruption Measures**

* No strengthening of:

  * Social audits
  * Transparency mechanisms

---

### **8. Mains Relevance**

#### **GS Paper II – Polity & Governance**

* Right to livelihood under Article 21.
* Centre–State relations.
* Decentralisation vs centralisation.

#### **GS Paper III – Economy & Social Justice**

* Rural employment.
* Poverty alleviation.
* Distress migration.

#### **GS Paper IV – Ethics**

* State obligation to protect dignity.
* Rights vs discretion in welfare.
* Justice to the most vulnerable.

---

### **9. Way Forward**

* Restore **demand-driven employment** as a legal right.
* Ensure:

  * Timely wage payments with enforceable compensation.
* Protect:

  * Panchayat autonomy.
  * Cooperative federalism.
* Strengthen:

  * Social audits.
  * Staffing and transparency.
* Treat employment not as expenditure, but as **investment in human dignity and resilience**.

---

### **10. Conclusion (UPSC-ready)**

MGNREGA was not merely a welfare scheme but a constitutional expression of the right to life with dignity. By replacing a rights-based, decentralised, demand-driven law with a centrally controlled, fiscally constrained framework, the VB-G RAM G Act formalises the dilution of rural workers’ rights. In doing so, it weakens both **Gandhi’s vision of local self-governance** and **Ambedkar’s insistence on enforceable rights**, reducing a constitutional guarantee into an administrative discretion.

## **Air Pollution, Right to Life & Environmental Constitutionalism in India**

---

### **1. Basic Understanding**

**The Delhi–NCR Air Pollution Problem**

* Every winter, **Delhi and NCR** face **severe smog** and hazardous Air Quality Index (AQI).
* Measures like:

  * Work from Home
  * Hybrid school classes
    provide **limited relief**, as pollution exposure continues in daily life.

**Major Sources of Air Pollution**

* Burning of fossil fuels
* Vehicular emissions
* Industrial processes
* Construction & demolition
* Waste burning
* Agricultural activities (stubble burning)

👉 Among all pollutants, **Particulate Matter (PM)** is the **most lethal**.

---

### **2. Severity of Particulate Matter (PM)**

**What is Particulate Matter?**

* **PM10**:

  * Particles ≤ 10 microns
  * Enter respiratory tract
* **PM2.5**:

  * Particles ≤ 2.5 microns
  * Penetrate deep into lungs and bloodstream
* **Diesel Particulate Matter (DPM)**:

  * Mostly < 1 micron
  * Extremely harmful, especially for **children and elderly**

**Health Impacts**

* Stroke
* Heart diseases
* Lung cancer
* Chronic respiratory disorders
* Premature deaths (millions globally)

---

### **3. Policy Response: GRAP & CAQM**

* **Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM)** amended the **Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP)**.
* Key changes:

  * **Mandatory closure of schools** in Delhi–NCR under **GRAP Phases III & IV**
  * Earlier: discretionary for States
  * Now: **compulsory**
  * **Staggering office timings** for public offices and municipal bodies under Phase III

👉 Indicates a shift from **advisory governance** to **enforceable environmental regulation**.

---

### **4. Constitutional Evolution of Environmental Rights**

#### **Article 21 – Right to Life**

* Original Constitution did not explicitly mention environment.
* Judicial interpretation expanded its scope.

📌 **Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India**

* Clean and healthy environment included within “life”.

---

#### **42nd Constitutional Amendment (1976)**

* Inserted:

  * **Article 48A**
    → State’s duty to protect environment
  * **Article 51A(g)**
    → Citizen’s duty to protect nature

📌 **Subhash Kumar v. State of Bihar**

* Articles 48A & 51A(g) read with Article 21.
* Right to **pollution-free air and water** recognised.

---

### **5. Judiciary as Environmental Guardian**

Due to:

* Privatisation
* Liberalisation
* Weak executive enforcement

👉 Judiciary stepped in via **Public Interest Litigations (PILs)** under:

* **Article 32**
* **Article 226**

---

### **6. Key Environmental Jurisprudence**

#### **(a) Right to Healthy Environment**

* 📌 **Rural Litigation and Entitlement Kendra v. State of Uttar Pradesh**

  * First explicit recognition of environmental protection under Article 21.
* 📌 **M.C. Mehta v. Union of India**

  * Pollution-free environment = Fundamental Right.

---

#### **(b) Disaster & Liability Principles**

📌 **Oleum Gas Leak Case**

* Introduced **Absolute Liability**:

  * No exceptions

### **11. Conclusion (UPSC-ready)**

Indian constitutional jurisprudence has progressively elevated environmental protection from a policy goal to a fundamental right under Article 21. Through doctrines such as absolute liability, precautionary principle, polluter pays, and public trust, the judiciary has acted as the guardian of environmental justice. However, in the face of worsening air pollution and climate change, judicial creativity alone is insufficient. An explicit constitutional recognition of the right to a clean and healthy environment is the need of the hour to ensure accountability of both the State and citizens in safeguarding ecological balance.
