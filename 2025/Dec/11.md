# AI must pay
## **1. Basic Understanding**

### **Why AI training needs massive data**

Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 or Gemini improve through:

1. **Advances in machine learning techniques**, and
2. **Access to enormous volumes of text, images, audio and video** from the internet.

Modern AI learns patterns, reasoning structures and knowledge not by memorising content but by **statistical inference** across vast datasets.

### **The Core Problem**

AI companies argue:

* Internet content should be **freely usable for training**, even if the same content cannot be reproduced by humans without a licence.

Content creators argue:

* AI firms profit from their work
* They deserve **licensing fees**
* Data scraping without consent violates copyright, commercial rights and sometimes privacy

This has led to global conflicts: lawsuits by *The New York Times*, *ANI*, book authors, entertainment firms, etc.

---

## **2. The News – DPIIT Working Paper on AI & Copyright**

The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) released a **working paper proposing a mandatory licensing regime** for AI training.

### **Key elements of the proposal**

* AI companies can **scrape public internet data without restriction**.
* But once they **commercialise** their models, they must pay royalties.
* A new non-profit copyright society-like body will collect and distribute these royalties:
  **Copyright Royalties Collective for AI Training (CRCAT)**.

### **Why this model was chosen**

* **Opt-out models are difficult to enforce** → small publishers cannot monitor or stop AI scraping.
* Many websites do not have the technical capacity to prevent AI crawlers.
* AI models don’t “copy” content but produce **new, synthetic outputs**, reducing direct infringement concerns.
* Mandatory licensing provides a **middle path**:

  * India supports AI growth,
  * Indian creators get paid.

### **Why urgency is needed**

* Court cases worldwide have not produced uniform principles.
* Waiting for judicial clarity may take years.
* Meanwhile, AI companies continue to benefit from unregulated training data.

---

## **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

### **The Proposed CRCAT Model**

* Acts like a copyright collecting society (similar to IPRS in music).
* Collects royalties based on the **revenue earned by AI developers** using Indian content.
* Distributes funds to content creators proportionally.

### **Upcoming DPIIT Working Paper (Next Phase)**

Will address:

1. **Are AI-generated works copyrightable?**
2. **Who is the author?** Human? AI developer? Model trainer?

### **Future Copyright Act Amendments**

The government intends to amend the **Copyright Act, 1957** within 3 years to:

* Institutionalise mandatory licensing
* Define AI authorship rules
* Regulations for data scraping and model training
* Create safeguards against misuse of scraped content

---

## **4. Mains Relevance – Analytical Perspective**

### **A. Benefits of India’s mandatory licensing proposal**

#### **1. Balances innovation and creators’ rights**

* Allows AI ecosystems to flourish (scraping allowed)
* Ensures content creators (publishers, writers, journalists) get compensation

#### **2. Practical and enforceable**

Opt-out regimes fail because:

* AI crawlers ignore “robots.txt”
* Small content producers lack technical tools
  Mandatory licensing is simpler and fairer.

#### **3. Avoids a litigation-heavy future**

* Courts have not settled whether AI training constitutes copyright infringement.
* Lawsuits are expensive and slow.
* A statutory regime provides predictability.

#### **4. Aligns India with global trends**

* EU, UK, US are debating similar frameworks.
* India’s model could become a **Global South template**.

---

### **B. Key Concerns & Limitations**

#### **1. Royalty distribution fairness**

* How will CRCAT decide payments?
* Should big media houses receive the same per-article rate as small publishers?
* Risk of **power imbalance** if larger players capture most royalties.

#### **2. Burden of proof concerns**

Tech firms fear:

* They may be forced to prove they *did not* use content → technically impossible.
* AI training is probabilistic, not traceable.

#### **3. Possible cost escalation**

If royalties become too expensive,

* Indian startups may lose competitiveness
* Only hyperscalers (Big Tech) can afford training costs

#### **4. Lack of global harmonisation**

AI models trained abroad may circumvent India’s rules.
Enforcement across borders remains uncertain.

---

### **C. Ethical and Socio-Economic Dimensions**

* Media, journalism and creative industries are already under stress.
* AI output may reduce traffic to original content sources.
* Fair compensation prevents erosion of content-producing ecosystems.
* Without regulation, AI monopolies could deepen digital inequality.

---

## **5. Way Forward**

### **1. Transparency Framework**

* AI systems must disclose *data categories*, not specific sources
* Regular reporting of usage patterns
* Audits of training datasets

### **2. Graduated Royalty System**

* Higher payments for unique, long-form, high-investment content
* Lower rates for generic content
* Bonus payments for smaller publishers

### **3. Clear definitions in law**

* Define “training,” “fine-tuning,” “scraping,” and “model commercialisation”
* Bring clarity to what counts as infringing output

### **4. Safeguards for small AI startups**

* Lower royalty slabs
* Government-supported compute credits
* Shared public datasets for training

### **5. Promote collaborative ecosystem**

* Encourage joint ventures between media houses and AI firms
* Build national datasets curated ethically

### **6. Strengthen copyright institutions**

* CRCAT must be transparent, audited, democratic, and representative of all sectors

# ​Truce in tatters
## **1. Basic Understanding**

### **Background of the Dispute**

The Thailand–Cambodia border conflict centres on the **Preah Vihear temple**, an 11th-century Khmer Hindu temple located along the **Dângrêk mountain ranges**.

* Colonial-era treaties — **Franco–Siam treaties of 1904 and 1907** — attempted to define borders between **Siam (Thailand)** and **French Indochina (Cambodia)**.
* However, the borders remained **poorly demarcated** on the ground, leaving room for longstanding disputes.

### **1962 ICJ Verdict**

* The **International Court of Justice (ICJ)** awarded **sovereignty of the Preah Vihear temple to Cambodia**.
* But ambiguity persisted over the **adjacent territory** — the land around the temple — which Thailand continued to claim.

Since then, intermittent military clashes have occurred, especially after the temple was declared a **UNESCO World Heritage Site (2008)**, which reignited nationalist sentiments on both sides.

### **Why the Area is Sensitive**

* Strategic hilltop location
* Symbolic and cultural importance
* Economic implications (tourism areas, trade routes)
* Nationalist politics in both countries

---

## **2. The News – Timeline of Escalation in 2025**

### **May 2025 – Skirmish**

* 1 Cambodian soldier killed near Preah Vihear.
* Cambodia retaliated by **banning Thai goods** and **closing border crossings**.

### **July 2025 – Landmine Blast**

* 5 Thai soldiers injured.
* Thailand accused Cambodia of laying mines, **downgraded diplomatic relations**.
* Result: 48 killed, 3,00,000 civilians displaced within five days of cross-border fighting.

### **Late July 2025 – Ceasefire**

* Brokered by **Malaysia’s PM Anwar Ibrahim**, backed by **U.S. President Donald Trump**.
* Ceasefire fragile; mistrust persisted.

### **November 2025 – Ceasefire Suspension**

* Thailand suspended the ceasefire after another landmine explosion injured soldiers.

### **December 7, 2025 – Renewed Fighting**

* Cambodia accused Thailand of launching **air strikes**.
* Marks a dangerous collapse of the fragile truce.

The crisis now threatens **regional stability**, investor confidence, tourism, and ASEAN unity.

---

## **3. Government Interventions & Diplomatic Frameworks**

### **ASEAN Mechanisms**

* **ASEAN Charter** emphasises peaceful settlement of disputes.
* **ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF)** can facilitate dialogue.
* Past mediation attempts: Indonesia (2011), ASEAN-led monitoring teams.

### **International Legal Mechanisms**

* ICJ judgment (1962) → awarded temple to Cambodia.
* 2013 ICJ clarification reaffirmed Cambodia’s sovereignty but did not fully demarcate the surrounding land.

### **Role of External Actors**

* **Malaysia**: Diplomatic mediation
* **Indonesia**: Regional stabiliser within ASEAN
* **United States**: Provided political backing for July ceasefire
* **UNESCO**: Maintains heritage site listings but does not enforce border settlements

Despite these frameworks, neither side has conclusively resolved border demarcation.

---

## **4. Mains Relevance – Analytical Perspective**

### **A. Root Causes**

1. **Colonial-era ambiguities** in Franco–Siam maps
2. **Incomplete ground demarcation**
3. **Nationalist politics** in Thailand and Cambodia
4. **Strategic & cultural value** of the Preah Vihear region
5. **Mutual distrust** and militarisation

### **B. Consequences for ASEAN & Regional Stability**

* Undermines ASEAN’s image as a **stable economic bloc**
* Investors withdraw amid uncertainty
* Tourism declines — major blow to both economies
* Diverts resources towards militarisation
* Further weakens ASEAN already struggling with the **Myanmar crisis**

### **C. Why ASEAN’s Credibility Is at Stake**

ASEAN is built on:

* non-interference
* consensus
* diplomatic conflict resolution

A failure to contain the conflict signals:

* reduced diplomatic capacity
* fragmentation within ASEAN
* increased opening for external powers to shape regional dynamics

### **D. Humanitarian Concerns**

* 3,00,000 displaced in 5 days → massive relief needs
* Risk of landmines and unexploded ordnance
* Food, water, and medical shortages
* Border communities vulnerable to economic collapse

---

## **5. Way Forward**

### **1. Immediate Ceasefire and Disengagement**

* ASEAN-led monitoring mission
* Third-party verification (Indonesia/Malaysia)
* Hotline mechanism between militaries

### **2. Confidence-Building Measures**

* Reopening border crossings
* Withdrawal of heavy artillery
* Joint de-mining operations
* Cross-border trade revival initiatives
* Cultural exchanges and joint temple management efforts

### **3. Long-term Border Resolution**

* A **joint border demarcation commission** using:

  * satellite imagery
  * modern surveying
  * ICJ interpretations
* Accepting neutral arbitration if bilateral talks fail.

### **4. Strengthening ASEAN Peace Architecture**

* Revise ASEAN conflict-resolution protocols
* Empower ASEAN Secretariat for proactive intervention
* Develop an ASEAN Border Crisis Response Mechanism

### **5. Engage External Actors Carefully**

* U.S., China, and EU may help diplomatically, but ASEAN must **retain centrality**.
* Avoid great-power competition influencing the conflict.

### **6. Protect Civilians**

* Humanitarian corridors
* Refugee safety arrangements
* UNHCR involvement

A sustainable peace must combine **legal settlement**, **political dialogue**, and **civic reconciliation**.

# A verdict that is an abdication of judicial function
## **1. Basic Understanding**

### **What was the 16th Presidential Reference about?**

The President referred questions to the Supreme Court under **Article 143** after repeated conflicts between State governments and Governors, especially concerning:

* **Delays in granting assent to Bills under Article 200**,
* Whether constitutional authorities such as Governors, Speakers, and Presidents can delay decisions indefinitely.

### **Supreme Court’s Key Position**

The Court held that **it cannot prescribe timelines** for high constitutional authorities (Governor, President, Speaker), because:

* The **Constitution does not specify timelines**,
* The judiciary should not “judicially legislate.”

The Court’s reasoning reflects **judicial restraint** and deference to the text of the Constitution.

### **Why the Judgment is Controversial**

Critics argue the Court has:

* **Abdicated its role** in evolving constitutional doctrine,
* Failed to interpret constitutional silences in a manner that protects democratic functioning,
* Allowed Governors or Speakers to misuse their discretion, undermining State governments and democratic mandates.

---

## **2. The News / Core Issue**

### **Constitutional Silence → Administrative Abuse**

The Constitution is silent about time limits for:

* Governor’s assent to Bills (Article 200),
* Speaker’s decision on anti-defection cases (Tenth Schedule),
* President’s assent under Article 111.

This silence is being misused:

* **Speakers delay disqualification** of MLAs, helping governments survive,
* **Governors delay Bills** to stall elected governments’ legislative agendas,
* Constitutional functionaries exercise power in ways that **subvert democracy**.

### **How the Court Interpreted the Issue**

The Court declined to fill this constitutional gap, arguing that:

* Timelines are a matter for **Parliament** or **constitutional amendment**,
* Courts cannot re-write the Constitution.

This is seen as a conservative interpretation of judicial role.

---

## **3. Government Interventions / Constitutional Framework**

### **Relevant Articles**

* **Article 200** – Governor’s assent to Bills
* **Article 111** – President’s assent
* **Tenth Schedule** – Anti-defection adjudication by Speakers
* **Article 143** – Presidential reference to the Supreme Court

### **Judicial Principles**

* **Judicial creativity is permitted**, but only within constitutional boundaries
* Past cases (e.g., *S.R. Bommai*, *Nabam Rebia*, *Keisham Meghachandra Singh*) have expanded judicial power to protect State governments from misuse of office
* Courts have previously intervened where constitutional silence allowed political abuse

### **Ambedkar’s Idea of Constitutional Morality**

* Constitutional morality is essential to prevent **perversion of constitutional forms**,
* It requires institutions to act in **good faith**,
* It empowers courts to interpret constitutional silences to uphold democratic values.

---

## **4. Mains Relevance – Critical Analysis**

### **A. What is the “constitutional anomaly”?**

* Assembly tenure = **5 years**
* Speaker delays anti-defection rulings = **MLAs escape consequences**
* Governor delays Bill assent = **elected government’s will is blocked**

This **defeats democratic accountability** and allows manipulation of constitutional positions.

---

### **B. Why the Court’s judgement is criticised**

#### **1. Failure to safeguard democratic accountability**

By refusing to set timelines, the Court has:

* Enabled Governors to **sit indefinitely** on Bills,
* Allowed Speakers to delay anti-defection decisions,
* Permitted constitutional authorities to stall elected legislatures.

#### **2. Judicial restraint mistaken as neutrality**

While the Court claims fidelity to constitutional text, the effect is:

* Empowering unelected authorities (Governors),
* Weakening federalism and State autonomy,
* Encouraging political partisanship.

#### **3. Ignoring constitutional morality**

Earlier landmark judgments (*Sabarimala*, *Navtej Johar*) used constitutional morality to interpret silences in a progressive manner.
Here, the Court seems unwilling to extend such reasoning to strengthen democratic governance.

#### **4. Undermining the basic structure:**

* Democracy
* Rule of Law
* Federalism
* Separation of Powers

are all affected when Governors/Speakers can delay indefinitely.

---

### **C. Why the Judgment is Defended by Some**

* Courts must avoid **overreach**
* Timelines = policy choices → Parliament, not judiciary
* Ensures separation of powers
* Prevents judiciary from being seen as a political actor

---

## **5. Way Forward**

### **1. Parliament must amend Articles 111 and 200**

* Mandate **reasonable timelines** (e.g., 30 or 45 days) for Governor/President assent
* Follow models like South Africa where constitutional timelines exist

### **2. Reform the Tenth Schedule**

* Impose strict deadlines (e.g., 3 months) for Speakers to decide on defections
* Transfer adjudication to an **independent tribunal** (as suggested by experts and former CECs)

### **3. Codify conventions**

* India lacks clear conventions; codifying them can reduce misuse
* Prevent Governors from acting as political agents

### **4. Strengthen Constitutional Morality Training**

* Mandatory orientation for Governors, Speakers, MLAs, Ministers
* Accountability for constitutional misconduct

### **5. Judiciary must remain alert**

While the Court may not fix rigid timelines, it can:

* Intervene when delay becomes **malafide**,
* Issue **structured guidelines** without prescribing exact days.

# India gives tepid response to Russian push for Su-57, long-range drones and submarines
## **1. Basic Understanding**

### **What is happening?**

Russia has offered India several high-end defence platforms, including:

* **Su-57** fifth-generation stealth fighter jet
* **Long-range drones** (Geran series / Shahed-136 variants)
* **Submarines**
* **S-500 air defence system**

But India has shown **limited interest**.

### **Why is India hesitant?**

Because India’s strategic focus has shifted towards:

* **Indigenisation under Atmanirbhar Bharat**,
* Reducing overdependence on foreign suppliers,
* Building long-term domestic R&D and manufacturing capacity.

Thus, even though Russia remains a traditional strategic and defence partner, India is no longer inclined to sign major import-heavy deals.

---

## **2. The News – Key Developments**

### **A. Russia’s Offer**

Ahead of President Vladimir Putin’s recent visit, Moscow made repeated proposals for:

* Su-57 fighters
* Geran-series kamikaze drones
* Submarines
* Air defence systems

Russia hoped for breakthroughs during the visit.

### **B. India’s Response**

* India expressed **little enthusiasm** for the platforms.
* No major defence contracts were announced.
* 19 agreements focused mainly on **trade**, not defence hardware.

### **C. Official Position**

Indian officials confirmed:

> “We are very much focusing on development of indigenous products.”

### **D. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh’s Statement**

At Leh, he highlighted the **sharp rise in domestic capability**:

* Defence production increased from **₹46,000 crore (2014)** → **₹1.51 lakh crore (2024–25)**
* Defence exports surged from **< ₹1,000 crore** → **~₹24,000 crore**

This signals a **paradigm shift in India’s defence strategy**.

### **E. India–Russia Defence Talks Continue**

At the 23rd Working Group Meeting (Moscow, Oct 29):

* Discussions were held on tri-service cooperation and R&D.
* A Protocol was signed outlining areas for future collaboration.
* But **big-ticket deals remain elusive**.

---

## **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

### **A. Atmanirbhar Bharat in Defence**

Key policies shaping India’s current stance:

* **Positive Indigenisation Lists** (banning import of several defence platforms)
* **iDEX**, DRDO–Industry collaborations
* **Make in India categories** (Make-I, Make-II, SP model)
* **FDI allowing 74% automatic route** in defence
* **Corporatisation of OFB**

### **B. Long-Term Vision**

* Develop indigenous fighters (Tejas MK-2, AMCA)
* Build domestic UAV and drone systems
* Expand submarine production (Project-75I)
* Strengthen air defence through indigenous systems
* Reduce vulnerability arising from single-vendor dependence

Russia’s offers must be seen against this backdrop.

---

## **4. Mains Relevance – Analytical Perspective**

### **A. Why is India Cooling on Russian Defence Offers?**

#### **1. Strategic Autonomy & Diversification**

* Russia’s Ukraine war has stressed its industrial capacity.
* Delivery delays (e.g., S-400 supplies) weaken reliability.
* India wants multi-source partnerships (U.S., France, Israel).

#### **2. Fear of Technology Obsolescence**

* Questions about the maturity of Su-57 technology.
* Geran drones are effective but low-cost, low-tech, and **India can develop better indigenous UAVs**.
* S-500 is new and untested in export environments.

#### **3. Supply Chain Concerns**

* Sanctions against Russia complicate payments, logistics and spares.
* India seeks systems free from geopolitical vulnerabilities.

#### **4. Rise of Indian Defence Ecosystem**

* India wants to:

  * Export drones, not import them
  * Build fighter jets under AMCA
  * Manufacture submarines domestically
* High dependence on imports contradicts manufacturing targets.

---

### **B. Why Russia is Pushing Hard?**

1. Russia faces declining defence exports due to Western sanctions.
2. India has historically been Russia’s biggest defence client.
3. Moscow wants to preserve this strategic market.
4. Offers of advanced systems aim to keep India engaged.

---

### **C. Implications for India–Russia Relations**

#### **Positive**

* Defence R&D cooperation continues.
* Political relationship remains strong.
* Energy cooperation deepening.

#### **Concerns**

* If India cuts imports drastically, Russia may:

  * Lose influence in India
  * Pivot more strongly towards China

#### **Balance India Must Maintain**

* Pursue indigenisation
* But preserve Russia as a strategic partner
* Without compromising autonomy vis-à-vis China and the West

This requires **smart diplomacy**.

---

## **5. Way Forward**

### **1. Deepen Joint R&D Instead of Importing**

* Co-develop next-generation aircraft technologies
* Focus on engines, EW systems, hypersonics
* Expand BrahMos-like partnerships

### **2. Build Indigenous Ecosystem**

* Accelerate AMCA, Tejas Mk-2, CHEETAH drones, Tapas UAV
* Encourage startups under iDEX
* Strengthen DRDO–private partnerships

### **3. Rationalise Defence Procurement**

* Buy foreign only when technology is critical and unavailable domestically
* Prefer:

  * Transfer of Technology
  * Co-production
  * Joint ventures

### **4. Manage Russia Relations Carefully**

* Avoid sudden disengagement
* Maintain long-term cooperation in:

  * Spares
  * Reactor technology
  * Nuclear submarines
  * Missile systems

### **5. Encourage High-Level Defence Dialogue**

* Evaluate where Russia can complement, not replace, Indian manufacturing
* Ensure no gaps in critical capability areas

# Is India’s 8.2% growth rate sustainable?
## **1. Basic Understanding**

### **India’s GDP Performance (Latest Quarter)**

India reported **₹48.63 lakh crore output in a single quarter** and **8.2% real GDP growth**, indicating:

* A **genuine, broad-based momentum**, not a post-pandemic rebound
* Manufacturing up **9.1%**
* Services up **9.2%** (now **60% of total GDP**)
* Financial services at **10.2%** → robust credit and urban consumption
* Real GVA up from ₹82.88 lakh crore → ₹89.41 lakh crore
* Nominal GDP rose **only 8.8%** → shows **inflation contained**

### **Why these numbers matter**

* PFCE grew **7.9%** → consumer confidence rising
* Agriculture grew **3.5%** → reservoirs full, better horticulture output
* Bank credit strong; NPAs low; capital buffers high
* Fiscal consolidation continues (supported by GST + direct taxes)
* External stability maintained (services exports + diversified forex reserves)

**Superficially, the Indian economy looks strong, resilient, and outperforming the world.**

---

## **2. The News – IMF’s Surprising “Grade C” for India**

Despite high growth, the IMF assigned **‘Grade C’** to India in its national income accounting assessment.

### **Why Grade C? (IMF’s Six Key Concerns)**

1. **Outdated base year (2011–12)** → makes GDP less reflective of current structure
2. **Reliance on WPI instead of Producer Price Index (PPI)** for deflators
3. **Excessive use of single deflation** → may distort real GVA
4. **Large discrepancies between production and expenditure GDP**

   * Weak expenditure-side data
   * Poor coverage of informal sector
5. **No seasonally adjusted GDP data**, and outdated techniques
6. **Lack of consolidated State + local body accounts after 2019**

### **What the IMF is *really* saying**

India’s **economic performance is strong**, but its **statistical architecture is weak**.
Growth = muscle
Institutions + data systems = bone
India has strong muscle but insufficient bone strength.

---

## **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

### **Efforts Already Underway**

* MoSPI’s proposal for a new GDP base year
* Work to expand MCA-21 corporate data
* Better GST-linked activity indicators
* Efforts to improve formalisation via UPI, Aadhaar, PAN, Jan Dhan
* RBI’s governance reforms for NBFCs, banks, and data systems

### **Fiscal & External Policy Strengths**

* Fiscal consolidation track maintained
* Strong digital compliance supports GST
* External sector stable due to IT/ITES, remittances, diversified reserves

Yet, structural constraints limit the quality of macro data.

---

## **4. Mains Relevance – Analytical Perspective**

### **A. Growth vs Structural Vulnerability**

#### **1. Uneven Sectoral Recovery**

* Electricity & utilities grew only **4.4%**
* Mining grew a negligible **0.04%**
* Weather anomalies disrupted output
* Backbone sectors remain weak

#### **2. Output–Employment Mismatch**

GDP Contribution (Q2):

* Primary: **14%**
* Secondary: **26%**
* Tertiary: **60%**

But employment:

* ~45% in agriculture
* ~25% in low-wage services

→ India’s labour force is concentrated where productivity is low.
→ GDP growth does not equal broad-based prosperity.

---

### **B. Structural Challenges Highlighted by RBI**

#### **1. Export vulnerability**

* Goods exports lag behind
* Services & remittances cannot fully substitute
* Global protectionism rising
* Supply chain disruptions intensifying

#### **2. Rupee stability is managed, not natural**

* Strong USD exerting downward pressure
* Dependence on volatile FPI flows persists
* RBI intervention necessary to smooth volatility

#### **3. Institutional capacity remains uneven**

* Weak State-level governance
* Incomplete data systems
* Slow statistical modernization
* Limited productivity growth

These undermine long-term reliability of high growth.

---

### **C. Why IMF’s Grade Matters**

Because it reflects **credibility**, not **performance**.
GDP measures activity, but IMF measures **systems** that support that activity.

A country can grow at **8%** and still:

* Have inconsistent data
* Have outdated deflators
* Lack granular labour market statistics
* Miss seasonally adjusted data
* Under-represent its informal sector
* Have limited institutional depth

Thus, **IMF’s “Grade C” is not a comment on growth, but on the architecture behind that growth.**

---

## **5. Way Forward**

### **1. Update India’s Statistical Framework**

* Adopt a new GDP base year (post-digital economy)
* Expand Producer Price Index (PPI) coverage
* Use double-deflation methods
* Improve survey frequency (household, labour, consumption)
* Publish seasonally adjusted time series data

### **2. Strengthen State-level institutional capacity**

* Revamp State statistical bureaus
* Standardise accounting for State + local bodies
* Improve data collaboration with GSTN, EPFO, MCA-21

### **3. Align Growth with Employment**

* Accelerate manufacturing push (PLI, logistics reforms)
* Promote labour-intensive exports (textiles, leather, electronics assembly)
* Skilling and mobility reforms

### **4. Deepen Economic Diversification**

* Reduce dependence on weather-sensitive primary sectors
* Expand renewable energy to reduce seasonal volatility
* Promote high-tech, value-added exports

### **5. Build Credibility Through Transparency**

* Publish methodological notes
* Strengthen independence of MoSPI
* Improve real-time data availability

India’s GDP growth is impressive; the **quality of the framework** behind that number needs upgrading.
