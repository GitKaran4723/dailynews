# 97 lakh electors deleted in T.N., 74 lakh in Gujarat
## Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of Electoral Rolls – Tamil Nadu & Gujarat
---

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

**Electoral Rolls**

* Electoral rolls are official lists of eligible voters prepared and maintained by the **Election Commission of India (ECI)** under **Article 324** of the Constitution.
* Only those whose names appear in the rolls can vote → hence, accuracy is crucial for **free and fair elections**.

**Special Intensive Revision (SIR)**

* A **door-to-door, ground-level verification** exercise.
* Objective:

  * Remove **ineligible entries** (deceased, shifted, duplicates)
  * Add **eligible but missing voters**
* Unlike annual summary revision, **SIR is exhaustive and intrusive**, hence politically sensitive.

---

### 2. **The News**

* The ECI published **integrated draft electoral rolls** for **Tamil Nadu** and **Gujarat** after the SIR enumeration.
* **Large-scale deletions observed**:

**Tamil Nadu**

* Before SIR (Oct 27 freeze): **6.41 crore electors**
* After draft rolls: **5.43 crore electors**
* **Deleted**: **97.3 lakh (≈15%)**

  * Deceased: 26.9 lakh
  * Shifted/Absent: **66.4 lakh**
  * Duplicates: 3.98 lakh

**Gujarat**

* **73.7 lakh electors removed** (≈14.5%)

**Chennai District**

* Deletions: **14.2 lakh**
* Percentage deleted: **35.6%**
* Electors reduced from **40 lakh → 25.7 lakh**

**Process safeguard**

* Draft rolls released **in presence of recognised political parties**.
* **Claims & objections window**: Dec 19 – Jan 18, 2026.

---

### 3. **Political & Institutional Responses**

* **Yogendra Yadav**, founder of **Swaraj Abhiyan**:

  * Called it an **“unprecedented and shocking” scale of deletions**.
  * Flagged risk of **mass disenfranchisement**.
  * Expected pruning of ~41 lakh, not nearly 1 crore.

* **P. Chidambaram**:

  * Drew attention to **66.4 lakh marked as shifted/absent**.
  * Urged political parties to **closely scrutinize this category**.

---

### 4. **Why This Matters (UPSC Mains Relevance)**

#### A. **Democracy & Electoral Integrity**

* Voting is a **statutory right**, but elections are part of the **basic structure**.
* Excessive deletions → undermine **representative democracy**.

#### B. **Risk of Disenfranchisement**

* Urban areas (like **Chennai**) have:

  * Migrant population
  * Informal housing
  * Frequent mobility
* “Shifted/Absent” category is **highly subjective** → risk of exclusion of:

  * Migrant workers
  * Urban poor
  * Tenants, students

#### C. **Trust Deficit in Institutions**

* Even if process is legal, **perception of bias** can erode trust in ECI.
* Electoral legitimacy depends on **both procedure and public confidence**.

#### D. **Federal & Political Implications**

* Large deletions in opposition-ruled States may trigger:

  * Allegations of political misuse
  * Centre–State friction
* Adds to debates around **NPR, Census, NRC-type exercises**.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

**Administrative Measures**

* Robust **re-verification mechanism** before final rolls.
* Mandatory **SMS/notice + public display** before deletion.
* Special camps in:

  * Urban slums
  * Migrant clusters
  * Colleges and workplaces

**Institutional Safeguards**

* Independent **social audit** of SIR data.
* Greater transparency in criteria for “shifted/absent”.

**Citizen-Centric Approach**

* Simplify online & offline **claims/objections** process.
* Awareness campaigns in local languages.

**Democratic Principle**

* Balance between:

  * **Roll purity (accuracy)**
  * **Universal inclusion**
* In democracy, **wrong inclusion is less dangerous than wrong exclusion**.

# Do not rush it
## Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of Electoral Rolls – Constitutional & Democratic Concerns

---

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

**What is SIR?**

* **Special Intensive Revision (SIR)** is a **comprehensive verification** of electoral rolls conducted by the **Election Commission of India (ECI)**.
* It involves:

  * Collection of **enumeration forms** from voters
  * **Door-to-door verification** by **Booth Level Officers (BLOs)**
  * Digitisation and preparation of **draft electoral rolls**

**Legal-constitutional basis**

* Conducted under:

  * **Article 324** – superintendence of elections
  * **Representation of the People Act, 1950**
* While voting is a **statutory right**, elections form part of the **basic structure of the Constitution**.

---

### 2. **The News**

* ECI released **draft electoral rolls** for **7 States and UTs** after the **first phase of SIR**.
* **Large-scale deletions observed**:

**Tamil Nadu**

* Deleted voters: **>97 lakh**
* Percentage: **~15%** of pre-SIR rolls

**West Bengal**

* Deleted voters: **>58 lakh**
* Percentage: **~7.5%**
* Deletions highest in **urban areas**, especially **Kolkata**
* Many enumeration forms:

  * Unmapped to **2002 electoral roll**
  * Carrying **doubtful linkages**

**Bihar**

* **Supreme Court of India** allowed **Aadhaar** as a valid identity document.
* Outcome:

  * **68 lakh deletions**
  * **24 lakh additions/corrections**
  * Female gender ratio dropped from **907 → 892**

**Key procedural issue**

* **Compressed 53-day hearing window**
* EROs allegedly insisting on:

  * Citizenship proof
  * Parents’ birth details (for post-1987 born voters)

---

### 3. **Judicial Intervention**

* Supreme Court directed ECI to take a **“sympathetic view”** and consider **“ground realities”**.
* Suggested **extension of enumeration phase**.
* However:

  * Court has **not yet decided** on the **constitutionality of SIR itself**.

---

### 4. **Key Issues & Challenges (Mains Analysis)**

#### A. **Risk of Disenfranchisement**

* Vulnerable groups most affected:

  * Short-term migrants
  * Illiterate voters
  * Married women (name/address change)
* Urban bias evident → higher deletions in cities.

#### B. **Burden of Proof on Voters**

* Current model assumes:

  * **Voter must prove existence**
* This reverses democratic logic:

  * State should ensure inclusion, not citizens proving eligibility repeatedly.

#### C. **Data & Process Gaps**

* ECI relies on:

  * Booth Level Agents’ tabulation
* Does **not systematically cross-map** with:

  * Death registration databases
  * Other government datasets
* Leads to **avoidable exclusions**.

#### D. **Gender Implications**

* Bihar’s declining female sex ratio post-SIR suggests:

  * Women disproportionately excluded
  * Documentation gaps and mobility issues

#### E. **Administrative & Logistical Stress**

* Tight deadlines for BLOs
* States like **Kerala** faced overlap with **local body elections**
* Quality of verification suffers under pressure.

#### F. **Constitutional Uncertainty**

* Absence of a clear ruling on:

  * Whether SIR, as designed, violates:

    * Equality (Article 14)
    * Democratic participation
* Creates uncertainty for voters and ECI alike.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

**Short-term**

* Extend SIR timelines as suggested by the Supreme Court.
* Liberal acceptance of documents (Aadhaar, local proofs).
* Special facilitation camps for:

  * Migrants
  * Women
  * Urban poor

**Institutional Reforms**

* Mandatory **cross-verification with civil registration systems**.
* Clear, uniform guidelines for “shifted/absent” classification.
* Public disclosure of **booth-wise deletion reasons**.

**Democratic Principle**

* Shift from **exclusion-first** to **inclusion-first** approach.
* In elections:

  * **False negatives (wrong deletion)** are more harmful than **false positives**.

**Judicial Clarity**

* Early adjudication by the Supreme Court on:

  * Constitutionality of SIR
* Will bring certainty and trust.

* Constitutional backing:

  * **Article 21** – Right to life & dignity
  * **Article 23** – Prohibition of trafficking
  * **Article 39(e) & (f)** – Protection of children

---

### 2. **The News (Judgment Highlights)**

---

### 3. **Key Legal Observations by the Court**

#### A. **Nature of Child Trafficking**

* Trafficking networks function through:

  * Recruitment
  * Transportation
  * Harbouring
  * Exploitation
* These operate as **apparently independent verticals**, masking their connections through deception.

#### B. **Evidentiary Principles Laid Down**

* **Victim’s sole testimony is sufficient** if it is:

  * Credible
  * Convincing
* Courts **must not reject testimony** due to:

  * Minor inconsistencies
  * Inability to narrate events with precision

#### C. **Victim Is Not an Accomplice**

* A trafficked child:

  * **Must never be treated as an accomplice**
  * Her testimony should be treated like that of an **“injured witness”**

#### D. **Delayed Protest Is Natural**

* Courts must not view absence of immediate protest as:

  * “Against ordinary human conduct”
* Fear, deception, trauma and power imbalance explain silence.

#### E. **Recognising Vulnerability**

* Judicial scrutiny must consider:

  * Socio-economic vulnerability
  * Cultural and social marginalisation
* Sensitivity and realism are essential in appreciation of evidence.

---

### 4. **Constitutional & Ethical Significance (Mains Analysis)**

#### A. **Violation of Human Dignity**

* Court held trafficking strikes at:

  * **Bodily integrity**
  * **Human dignity**
* Direct assault on Article 21.

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

**Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)**

* CSR refers to the obligation of companies to contribute to **social, environmental and ethical development**, beyond profit-making.
* In India, CSR is statutorily recognised under the Companies Act, 2013.
* Traditionally, CSR was viewed as:

  * Education
  * Health
  * Poverty alleviation
    → **Environment often treated as optional or charitable**

**Constitutional Angle**

* **Supreme Court of India** has repeatedly expanded environmental jurisprudence using:

  * Article 21 – Right to life (includes clean environment)
  * Article 48A – State’s duty to protect environment
  * **Article 51A(g)** – Fundamental duty of citizens to protect nature

---

### 2. **The News (Judgment Highlights)**

* Bench:

  * Justice **P. S. Narasimha**
  * Justice **Atul S. Chandurkar**

* The Supreme Court held:

  * **CSR inherently includes environmental responsibility**
  * A corporation, as a **legal person**, has a **fundamental duty** to protect the environment.

> “The corporate duty must evolve from merely protecting shareholders to protecting the ecosystem that we all inhabit.”

---

### 3. **Case Background – Great Indian Bustard (GIB)**

* The case arose from petitions highlighting the threat to the **Great Indian Bustard**:

  * One of the **heaviest flying birds**
  * Flagship species of **arid and semi-arid grasslands**
  * Found mainly in:

    * **Rajasthan**
    * **Gujarat**
    * Around the **Thar Desert**

* Threats:

  * Power transmission lines
  * Mining
  * Renewable & non-renewable energy infrastructure
  * Habitat fragmentation

---

### 4. **Key Legal Principles Laid Down**

#### A. **CSR = Environmental Responsibility**

* CSR funds used for environmental protection are:

  * **Not charity**
  * **A constitutional obligation**
* Companies cannot claim to be “socially responsible” while harming ecosystems.

#### B. **Extension of Article 51A(g) to Corporations**

* Court brought **companies within the ambit of Fundamental Duties**.
* Though Article 51A applies to citizens, the Court reasoned:

  * Corporations are **key organs of society**
  * They must act as responsible environmental stakeholders.

#### C. **Polluter Pays Principle**

* Where corporate activity threatens endangered species:

  * Company must bear **cost of species recovery**
* CSR funds should be used for:

  * **In-situ conservation** (protecting natural habitat)
  * **Ex-situ conservation** (breeding, rehabilitation)

#### D. **Shared Environment Doctrine**

* Corporations must behave like **“guests in the abode of nature”**.
* Especially applicable to:

  * Power generators
  * Infrastructure projects near sensitive habitats

---

### 5. **Specific Directions by the Court**

* Upheld expert committee recommendations:

  * Priority conservation area revised to:

    * **14,013 sq. km** in Rajasthan
    * **740 sq. km** in Gujarat
* Directed energy companies to operate with heightened environmental sensitivity in GIB habitats.

---

### 6. **Mains Relevance (GS II + GS III + Ethics)**

#### A. **Environmental Governance**

* Strengthens India’s eco-centric jurisprudence.
* Moves from:

  * Anthropocentric → Ecocentric approach.

#### B. **Corporate Accountability**

* Redefines corporate duty beyond profit and shareholders.
* Aligns business with:

  * Sustainable development
  * Inter-generational equity

#### C. **Biodiversity Conservation**

* Reinforces protection of:

  * Grasslands (often neglected ecosystems)
  * Flagship species as ecological indicators

#### D. **Ethics & Values**

* Introduces compassion for non-human life into corporate ethics.
* Corporate conduct linked with **constitutional morality**.

---

### 7. **Way Forward**

**For Corporates**

* Integrate environment into core CSR strategy.
* Conduct biodiversity impact assessments proactively.
* Align with ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) norms.

**For the State**

* Clear CSR-environment guidelines.
* Stronger monitoring of CSR utilisation.
* Incentivise conservation-linked CSR projects.

**For Judiciary & Policy**

* Use this precedent to:

  * Protect other endangered species
  * Regulate infrastructure expansion in fragile zones
