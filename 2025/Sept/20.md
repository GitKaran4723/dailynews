# SC cites Preamble to reject plea against Banu Mushtaq opening Dasara in Mysuru
## Supreme Court on Secularism & Dasara Inauguration

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Preamble of the Constitution**: It sets out guiding principles such as *sovereignty, socialism, secularism, democracy, liberty, equality, and fraternity*. Secularism means the State does not favor any religion and ensures equal treatment for all.
* **Article 25**: Guarantees *freedom of conscience and the right to freely profess, practice, and propagate religion*, subject to public order, morality, health, and other provisions.
* **Dasara (Mysuru)**: A historic 10-day festival in Karnataka, with religious rituals at the Chamundeshwari temple and grand cultural events, often inaugurated by a public figure.
* **Issue in Case**: Whether inviting Booker Prize-winning Muslim author Banu Mushtaq to inaugurate the event violates the ‚Äúessential religious practice‚Äù of Hindus, since inauguration also involves a temple ritual.

### 2. **The News**

* On **September 20, 2025**, the **Supreme Court dismissed** a petition challenging the Karnataka government‚Äôs decision to invite Banu Mushtaq to inaugurate Mysuru Dasara.
* The petitioner argued that the inaugural pooja was an *essential Hindu religious practice* and must be performed only by a Hindu dignitary.
* The **SC Bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta** reminded the petitioner of the **Preamble‚Äôs ideals of secularism, liberty of thought, and equality**, underscoring India‚Äôs secular democratic framework.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Constitutional Safeguards**:

  * *Preamble*: Secularism, equality, liberty, fraternity.
  * *Article 25‚Äì28*: Freedom of religion and secular character of the State.
  * *Judicial precedents*: The SC has consistently upheld the secular character of the State (e.g., *S.R. Bommai v. Union of India*, 1994).
* **Karnataka Government**: Traditionally invites writers, artists, or cultural figures (irrespective of religion) to inaugurate Dasara, highlighting cultural unity.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

* **Issues & Challenges**:

  * Balancing *secular State functions* with *religious traditions*.
  * Preventing *politicization of religious ceremonies*.
  * Addressing *identity politics* around festivals.
* **Impact on Society & Polity**:

  * Reinforces secularism as part of constitutional morality.
  * Promotes inclusivity and national unity through shared cultural spaces.
  * Highlights friction between *cultural pluralism* and *religious exclusivity*.
* **Ethical/Governance Concerns**:

  * State neutrality in religious matters.
  * Avoiding misuse of ‚Äúessential religious practices‚Äù doctrine to push exclusionary agendas.

### 5. **Way Forward**

* **Judicial Clarity**: Continue to uphold *secular credentials* of the State while respecting genuine religious freedoms.
* **Cultural Inclusivity**: Governments should consciously involve diverse communities in cultural events to strengthen unity.
* **Public Awareness**: Promote constitutional literacy, especially about secularism and the Preamble, to counter narrow interpretations.
* **Depoliticizing Religion**: Ensure that State-sponsored cultural events remain spaces of *pluralism* rather than *religious exclusivity*.

* **Reservation Policies**: Several states have introduced *horizontal reservations* (20‚Äì35%) in police recruitment for women.
* **National Scenario**: Despite policy efforts, women remain underrepresented in the police force compared to global averages (where women often make up **20‚Äì30%**).

### 2. **The News**

* A study by **NLSIU, Bengaluru** shows:

  * **Karnataka** has only **8.91% women in its police force**, *despite 25% reservation*.
  * **National average**: **12.73%**.
  * **Bihar** has the highest share (**23.66%**).
  * Karnataka lags behind many states in implementation of women‚Äôs reservation.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **At National Level**:

  * *Advisory (2009)* by Ministry of Home Affairs: At least **33% reservation for women in police**.
  * *Bureau of Police Research & Development (BPR\&D)*: Collects data, issues model guidelines.
  * *Women Help Desks in Police Stations* under **Nirbhaya Fund**.
  * *All-women police stations* in several states.

  * **25% reservation** for women in police recruitment.
  * Special focus on recruiting women for *beat policing, cybercrime cells, and women & child protection units*.
  * Initiatives like *Vanitha Sahayavani* (helpline & support system).

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

* **Issues & Challenges**:

  * Cultural & social barriers (family restrictions, night duties, stigma).
  * Poor working conditions (lack of housing, toilets, childcare facilities).
  * *Tokenism*: Reservation not translating into actual representation.
  * Limited career advancement opportunities.
* **Impact on Society & Polity**:

  * Low trust of women in law enforcement.
  * Affects investigation of crimes like sexual harassment, trafficking, domestic violence.
  * Gender imbalance undermines inclusivity in governance.
* **Ethical/Governance Concerns**:

  * Equality vs token reservation.
  * Institutional bias in promotions and postings.

### 5. **Way Forward**

# Quit stalling
## Electoral Roll Manipulation Allegations ‚Äì Aland Case

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Electoral Rolls**: The official list of eligible voters maintained by the Election Commission of India (ECI). Errors, duplication, or deletion can disenfranchise voters and affect election fairness.
* **Form-7**: Used for *deletion of names* from electoral rolls (for reasons like death or shifting of residence). Misuse of Form-7 can lead to fraudulent voter removal.
* **Election Commission of India (ECI)**: A constitutional body (Article 324) responsible for conducting free and fair elections.
* **Cyber Forensics in Elections**: Fraudulent online submissions of voter forms leave digital footprints (IP addresses, port data) that help identify perpetrators.

### 2. **The News**

* **Rahul Gandhi**, Leader of Opposition, alleged that the **ECI stalled a probe** into electoral roll fraud in **Aland constituency (Karnataka, 2023 Assembly polls)**.
* Nearly **6,000 legitimate voters** were targeted for deletion through *fraudulent Form-7 submissions*.
* ECI **prevented actual deletions**, but Karnataka CID‚Äôs probe was hindered because the ECI **did not share crucial technical data** (IP addresses, device details) required to trace the fraudsters.
* Earlier allegations in Mahadevapura (another Karnataka constituency) were inconclusive, but Aland is being seen as a ‚Äúsmoking gun‚Äù case.
* Critics argue the **ECI‚Äôs credibility is eroding**, especially after concerns with the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of rolls in Bihar.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Constitutional Provisions**:

  * *Article 324*: Vests superintendence, direction, and control of elections in the ECI.
  * *Representation of the People Act, 1950 & 1951*: Legal framework for preparation of rolls and conduct of elections.
* **ECI‚Äôs Measures**:

  * Use of **IT-enabled electoral roll management**.
  * **Voter Helpline App** and online portals for transparency.
  * Guidelines against misuse of **Forms 6‚Äì8** (additions, deletions, corrections).
* **Judicial Oversight**: SC and High Courts have intervened in past cases of electoral roll manipulation to safeguard voting rights.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

* **Issues & Challenges**:

  * *Misuse of Form-7*: Risk of disenfranchising large numbers of voters.
  * *ECI‚Äôs credibility crisis*: Non-responsiveness to investigation requests undermines public trust.
  * *Cyber vulnerabilities*: Online roll management can be manipulated by miscreants with access to digital tools.
  * *Political mistrust*: Allegations of bias against the ECI erode democratic legitimacy.
* **Impacts**:

  * *Democracy*: Even attempted fraud undermines fairness and inclusiveness.
  * *Governance*: Weakens institutional credibility and public confidence.
  * *Society*: Disproportionately affects marginalized communities, who may lack the capacity to reassert voting rights.
* **Ethical/Governance Concerns**:

  * Transparency vs secrecy in sharing sensitive technical data.
  * Responsibility of constitutional bodies to be accountable to citizens.

### 5. **Way Forward**

* **For ECI**:

  * Proactively share technical data with investigating agencies (with safeguards).
  * Tighten verification mechanisms to prevent misuse of Form-7.
  * Regular public audits of electoral rolls.
  * Use AI tools to detect suspicious mass applications (same IP, device clusters).
* **For Government & Legislators**:

  * Amend electoral laws to penalize malicious voter deletion attempts.
  * Ensure independent oversight of ECI functioning to restore credibility.
* **For Civil Society & Political Parties**:

  * Raise awareness on voter rights and processes.
  * Train volunteers to monitor roll revisions at constituency level.
* **For Judiciary**:

  * Expedite cases involving electoral fraud to ensure timely redressal before elections.

# The Saudi-Pakistan pact is a dodgy insurance policy
## Saudi Arabia‚ÄìPakistan Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement (SMDA)

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **SMDA (Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement)**: A pact signed between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan on **17 September 2025** in Riyadh, pledging that an attack on one would be treated as an attack on both.
* **Historical context**:

  * Defence ties since **1951**, peaked during **1979‚Äì89** when \~20,000 Pakistani troops were stationed in Saudi Arabia.
  * Past tensions: Pakistani resentment at being treated as mercenaries, Saudi rejection of Shia soldiers, and Pakistan‚Äôs refusal to deploy troops in Gulf crises (1990 Kuwait war, 2015 Yemen war).
* **Geopolitical backdrop**:

  * U.S. role in nudging Riyadh‚ÄìIslamabad defence ties.
  * Regional tensions: Israel‚ÄìIran air war, Hamas‚ÄìIsrael conflict, and Israeli strike on Qatar (Sept 2025).
* **Strategic calculations**:

  * Saudi: Security buffer against Iran, Yemen, and Israel; hedging amid declining U.S. reliability.
  * Pakistan: Economic aid, military hardware, energy supplies, and diplomatic leverage against India.

### 2. **The News**

* On **Sept 17, 2025**, Crown Prince **Mohammed bin Salman** and PM **Shahbaz Sharif** signed the **SMDA**, witnessed by Pakistan Army Chief **Field Marshal Asim Munir**.
* The pact revives defence cooperation but is likely to be more limited than the past.
* The U.S. reportedly encouraged this alignment as part of regional balancing.
* India was informally kept in the loop, with Saudi officials stressing that ties with India remain robust and separate from this arrangement.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Saudi Arabia**:

  * Arms purchases worth **\$100 billion** from the U.S. to strengthen self-reliance.
  * Avoids Arab/Turkish troops at home; now falls back on Pakistan for limited roles.
* **Pakistan**:

  * Uses defence pacts to extract financial aid and training opportunities.
  * Past involvement in **nuclear proliferation (A.Q. Khan network)** makes Saudi ‚Äúnuclear umbrella‚Äù discussions sensitive.
* **India‚Äôs Diplomacy**:

  * Built strong energy, investment, and diaspora-based ties with Riyadh since 2014.
  * Defence and intelligence-sharing mechanisms institutionalised.
  * Secured reassurances from Riyadh that SMDA is not aimed against India.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

* **Issues & Challenges**:

  * Potential **nuclear dimension** if Saudi seeks covert assistance from Pakistan.
  * Risk of **India‚ÄìPakistan tensions spilling into West Asia**.
  * U.S. credibility crisis in Gulf security after failing to shield Qatar from Israeli strike.
  * Pakistan‚Äôs fragile economy may push it to monetise SMDA commitments disproportionately.
* **Impacts**:

  * **Regional security**: Could deepen Gulf rivalries with Iran.
  * **India‚Äôs interests**: Energy security, diaspora safety, and West Asian stability directly linked.
  * **Strategic balance**: India‚ÄìSaudi relations are strong, but SMDA adds complexity.
* **Ethical/Governance Concerns**:

  * Arms proliferation risks (especially nuclear).
  * Use of defence agreements as bargaining chips rather than genuine security commitments.

### 5. **Way Forward**

* **For India**:

  * Continue **strategic engagement with Saudi Arabia**, highlighting India‚Äôs role as a stable energy partner and responsible nuclear power.
  * Enhance **naval presence and cooperation** across the Arabian Sea for rapid crisis response.
  * Deepen **trilateral security dialogues** with Saudi Arabia and GCC states to prevent Pakistani overreach.
  * Invest in **diaspora diplomacy** to safeguard 2+ million Indians in the Kingdom.
* **For the Region**:

  * Strengthen **multilateral GCC security frameworks** to reduce reliance on bilateral deals.
  * Promote dialogue platforms including **India, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and U.S.**, balancing Pakistan‚Äôs role.
* **For Global Powers**:

  * U.S. needs to rebuild trust with GCC states by clear, consistent commitments.
