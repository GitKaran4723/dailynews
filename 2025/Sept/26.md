# Mistrust in Ladakh
## Ladakh Unrest and Demands for Autonomy

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Ladakh**: Became a **Union Territory (UT) without legislature** after the abrogation of Article 370 in August 2019. Earlier, it was part of Jammu & Kashmir.
* **Key Demands**:

  1. **Full Statehood** for Ladakh.
  2. **Inclusion under the Sixth Schedule** of the Constitution → provides autonomy to tribal areas (legislative & financial powers through Autonomous Councils).
  3. **Reservation in jobs for locals** with strict domicile rules.
  4. **Greater political representation** → more powers for Hill Development Councils (LAHDCs) in Leh and Kargil.
* **Civil society groups**:

  * **Leh Apex Body (LAB)** – Buddhist-majority Leh.
  * **Kargil Democratic Alliance (KDA)** – Muslim-majority Kargil.
  * Though often divided, both are united on the **four-point agenda** above.
* **Security sensitivity**: Ladakh borders China (LAC) and Pakistan → high national security stakes.

### 2. **The News**

* On **September 24, 2025**, protests in Leh turned **violent**, leaving **four dead** and many injured.
* Violence included **arson and vandalism**: BJP office and LAHDC headquarters attacked.
* Trigger: Hospitalisation of elderly hunger strikers, including those protesting with **climate activist Sonam Wangchuk**.
* **Centre’s stance**:

  * Had already announced concessions in **May 2025**:

    * 95% job reservation for locals.
    * 33% women’s quota in Hill Council.
    * Strict domicile rules.
    * Recognition of Ladakhi languages (Bhoti, Purgi, Balti, Shina).
  * Believes protest leaders acted in **bad faith** despite ongoing talks.
  * Alleges **instigation by Wangchuk** and hints at **foreign hand**.
* **Protest leaders’ stance**: Violence was by uncontrollable fringe elements; movement remains peaceful and constitutional.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Post-2019 measures**: UT status granted; LAHDCs retained limited local governance powers.
* **May 2025 agreement**: As above, offered **job reservations, women’s representation, cultural recognition**.
* **Security apparatus**: Heavy paramilitary deployment to maintain law and order.
* **Sixth Schedule debate**: So far, Centre reluctant to extend Sixth Schedule to Ladakh, citing **strategic/security concerns** and **small population size**.
* **Constitutional framework**:

  * Sixth Schedule currently applies to certain tribal areas of **Northeast India**.
  * Fifth Schedule applies to tribal areas in rest of India (but not Ladakh).

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

* **Federalism & Autonomy**:

  * Debate over **UT vs. Statehood** highlights tensions in Centre–State relations.
  * Balancing **tribal autonomy with national security** is a governance challenge.
* **Security & Geopolitics**:

  * Ladakh’s location near LAC (China) and LoC (Pakistan) makes unrest a national security concern.
  * External interference allegations → sovereignty issues.
* **Socio-political dynamics**:

  * Interplay between **Buddhist-majority Leh** and **Muslim-majority Kargil** requires sensitive handling to prevent communal divides.
* **Governance concerns**:

  * Protesters allege lack of trust and consultation.
  * Centre fears instability could weaken India’s negotiating position vis-à-vis China in Ladakh.
* **Ethics**:

  * Balancing **people’s aspirations vs. security imperatives**.
  * Use of force vs. dialogue in dealing with democratic protests.

### 5. **Way Forward**

* **Dialogue & Trust-building**:

  * Reopen structured talks with **LAB & KDA** under neutral facilitation.
  * Involve **civil society and youth leaders** to reduce alienation.
* **Institutional reforms**:

  * Strengthen **LAHDC powers** (financial & legislative).
  * Consider **modified Sixth Schedule provisions** tailored for Ladakh.
* **Economic & Social measures**:

  * Invest in **green infrastructure, tourism, and job creation** to address youth concerns.
  * Link **climate resilience policies** (important for Himalayan ecology) with local participation.
* **Security balance**:

  * Maintain law and order without excessive militarisation.
  * Separate genuine agitators from violent elements.
* **Long-term vision**:

  * A **special Ladakh package** that integrates **tribal autonomy, ecological sensitivity, and strategic security**.
  * Ensure Ladakhis feel ownership in decision-making while India retains sovereignty and security control.

# Eight States with international borders, 0.13% of exports
## U.S. Tariffs and India’s Export Imbalances: Spotlight on the Northeast

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Tariffs**: A tax imposed on imports; U.S. tariffs on Indian goods make them costlier in American markets, reducing India’s export competitiveness.
* **India’s export geography**: Highly **concentrated** in four States — Gujarat, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka (>70% of exports). Gujarat alone contributes ~33%.
* **Northeast India**: Despite **5,400 km of international borders**, contributes just **0.13% of national exports** due to lack of corridors, logistics, and supportive policies.
* **Strategic context**: Northeast borders Myanmar, a key to India’s **Act East Policy** and ASEAN trade, but trade links have decayed, replaced by security-centric infrastructure.

### 2. **The News**

* In **August 2025**, U.S. President **Donald Trump** imposed an **additional 25% tariff on Indian imports**, citing trade deficits, Russian crude purchases, and retaliatory precedent.
* India responded with **measured diplomacy**, avoiding open retaliation.
* But analysis shows these tariffs highlight **India’s internal imbalance**: export reliance on western/southern States, with **U.P., Bihar, M.P., and the Northeast almost absent**.
* **Northeast’s crisis points**:

  * **Tea economy** (Assam, Dooars): hit by stagnant prices + new tariffs, threatening jobs.
  * **Numaligarh refinery**: expanding, reliant on Russian crude → vulnerable to U.S. sanctions.
  * **Myanmar border trade**: collapsed post-2021 coup; closure of Free Movement Regime (2024) worsened situation.
* **Policy neglect**: National export strategies & incentive schemes (PLI, RoDTEP) exclude Northeast corridors.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Act East Policy**: Aimed at connecting India’s Northeast with ASEAN; key project → **India–Myanmar–Thailand Trilateral Highway**, but progress stalled.
* **Infrastructure efforts**: Sporadic investments in border roads, ICPs (Integrated Check Posts), but **cold chains, warehouses, logistics missing**.
* **Trade support schemes**:

  * **RoDTEP** (tax remission) & **PLI** (production-linked incentives) – skewed toward industrial belts in Gujarat–Tamil Nadu arc.
  * **Sagarmala & Bharatmala**: focus on ports & highways, not Northeast corridors.
* **Finance Commissions & Planning**: Limited recognition of Northeast’s export potential → representation missing in **Board of Trade, PM’s Economic Advisory Council**.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

* **Economic Geography**:

  * Overdependence on 4–5 States → vulnerability to shocks (natural disasters, strikes, global tariffs).
  * Neglect of Northeast undermines balanced regional development.
* **Federalism & Equity**:

  * Large States (U.P., Bihar, M.P.) & Northeast excluded from export-driven growth.
  * Imbalance risks **regional resentment** and **political alienation**.
* **Strategic & Security**:

  * U.S. tariffs linked to India’s Russian crude imports → Northeast (Numaligarh refinery) disproportionately exposed.
  * Myanmar border’s securitisation over commerce undermines India’s Act East & Indo-Pacific strategy, especially as China expands influence.
* **Socio-economic impact**:

  * Assam tea estates face job losses & wage stagnation.
  * Border towns (Moreh, Zokhawthar) slipping into economic irrelevance.
* **Governance & Policy**:

  * Export policies ignore spatial equity → resilience compromised.
  * Trade resilience ≠ product diversification alone; requires geographic diversification.

### 5. **Way Forward**

* **Diversify export geography**:

  * Develop **Northeast corridors** with ASEAN (via Myanmar, Bangladesh).
  * Expand **border trade infrastructure**: ICPs, warehouses, cold chains.
* **Policy reforms**:

  * Integrate Northeast-specific sections in national export strategies.
  * Extend **PLI & RoDTEP benefits** to Northeastern products (tea, agro-processing, handicrafts).
* **Economic diplomacy**:

  * Use FTAs (e.g., India–UK, India–EU) to push demand for Northeast products (tea, organic produce).
* **Strategic measures**:

  * Accelerate **India–Myanmar–Thailand Highway**; explore rail/river corridors.
  * Revive **cross-border kinship trade models** with safeguards (modified Free Movement Regime).
* **Local empowerment**:

  * Build **branding & packaging hubs** in Assam for tea exports.
  * Encourage MSMEs in bamboo, handicrafts, horticulture.
* **Resilience building**:

  * Treat **regional dispersion** as key to trade security.
  * Reduce overdependence on Gujarat–Tamil Nadu arc → create **redundant corridors** to absorb global shocks.

# Hot air
## Trump’s UNGA Speech on Climate Change

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Climate change**: Long-term shifts in global temperature and weather patterns, driven mainly by human activities such as burning fossil fuels, leading to rising greenhouse gas emissions.
* **Global warming vs. climate change**:

  * *Global warming*: Increase in Earth’s average surface temperature.
  * *Climate change*: Broader concept, including warming and disruptions in weather patterns, ocean currents, and precipitation.
* **Scientific consensus**: Since the 1990s, the **Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)** has consolidated findings from thousands of scientists showing overwhelming evidence of human-induced warming.
* **Natural variations**: Mid-20th century cooling (1945–1970) was due to sulphur emissions from coal → created temporary masking of warming, later offset by greenhouse gases.

### 2. **The News**

* **Event**: U.S. President **Donald Trump** addressed the **United Nations General Assembly (UNGA)**.
* **His claims**:

  * Called climate change the “**greatest con job**”.
  * Said “dishonest scientists” keep shifting narratives from cooling → warming → climate change.
  * Blamed Europe’s decarbonisation for “job losses and shuttered factories”.
  * Criticised renewable energy adoption (solar, wind) as a path to “destruction”.
* **Reality check**:

  * Global cooling theory was a minor, time-bound observation, not scientific consensus.
  * IPCC reports since the 1990s provide robust evidence separating natural and human-made climate influences.
  * Renewables are expanding globally, not as destruction but as pathways to resilience and energy security.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Global frameworks**:

  * *Kyoto Protocol (1997)* and *Paris Agreement (2015)*: key international treaties on emission reduction.
  * *UNFCCC COP meetings*: Ongoing negotiations on climate targets.
* **U.S. trajectory**:

  * Historically a leader in climate science (NASA, NOAA).
  * Trump’s earlier withdrawal from the **Paris Agreement (2017–2020)** weakened global cooperation.
  * Subsequent administrations (e.g., Biden) tried to reverse course with the **Inflation Reduction Act (2022)** and climate investments.
* **India’s stance**:

  * Advocates **climate justice** and **Common but Differentiated Responsibilities (CBDR)**.
  * Pushed for renewables (International Solar Alliance, National Hydrogen Mission).

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

* **International Relations**:

  * U.S. climate scepticism affects multilateral negotiations, weakening trust in global climate governance.
  * May embolden other reluctant economies.
* **Economy**:

  * Fossil fuel vs. green economy debate reflects transition tensions.
  * Trump’s rhetoric caters to coal, oil, and gas lobbies fearing loss of market share.
* **Science & Technology**:

  * Undermining climate science erodes public trust in scientific processes.
  * Threatens evidence-based policymaking.
* **Ethics & Equity**:

  * Developed nations’ responsibility vs. developing nations’ vulnerabilities.
  * Trump’s framing ignores equity, portraying climate action as economic suicide.
* **Environment & Security**:

  * Climate impacts include erratic monsoons, rising sea levels, droughts, and floods → directly linked to food security and migration pressures.

### 5. **Way Forward**

* **Strengthen multilateralism**:

  * Ensure **IPCC findings** remain central to climate negotiations.
  * Guard global climate policy from being hostage to short-term domestic politics.
* **Balance economic transition**:

  * Frame green energy as job creation, not destruction → highlight sectors like EVs, green hydrogen, solar manufacturing.
* **Communicate science better**:

  * Counter misinformation with **accessible explanations** of climate mechanics.
  * Involve local communities in evidence-sharing.
* **Equity in climate action**:

  * Keep focus on **climate finance, technology transfer, and adaptation funds** for developing nations.
* **India’s approach**:

  * Continue leading renewable initiatives (ISA, LiFE movement).
  * Use diplomatic space to build coalitions of Global South for fair burden-sharing.

# The Saudi-Pakistan deal upends India’s strategic thought
## Saudi–Pakistan Strategic Defence Pact and India’s Concerns

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Strategic Defence Pact**: A formal military/security agreement where two nations pledge to cooperate and defend each other in case of aggression.
* **Clause of concern**: “Any aggression against either country shall be considered an aggression against both” → resembles NATO-style collective defence.
* **Context**:

  * Pakistan = only Islamic nation with nuclear weapons, military with combat experience (largely vis-à-vis India).
  * Saudi Arabia = a major Gulf power, historically reliant on U.S. for security, now exploring new partnerships amid regional turbulence.
* **India’s position in West Asia**: Strong economic ties (energy, trade, diaspora) and improving defence/security ties with Gulf states in recent years, especially with Saudi Arabia and UAE.

### 2. **The News**

* In **September 2025**, **Saudi Arabia and Pakistan** signed a **Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement**.
* Pact includes **mutual defence clause** → aggression against one = aggression against both.
* Comes after:

  * **April 2025 Pahalgam terror attack** → largest India–Pakistan military exchange since 1971.
  * **Operation Sindoor** (India’s strikes on terror camps inside Pakistan).
  * Diplomatic churn: Saudi FM visited New Delhi during escalation; India tried isolating Pakistan internationally, but deal boosts Islamabad’s standing.
* **Geopolitical backdrop**:

  * Since **Hamas attack on Israel (2023)** and **Israel–Iran clashes (2024)**, West Asia is in flux.
  * Riyadh seeking **strategic autonomy** and **alternative military partnerships** beyond U.S.
  * Pakistan revives role as key Sunni ally; military cooperation has deep roots despite past strains (e.g., 2015 refusal to join Saudi war in Yemen).

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **India–Saudi ties**:

  * Strategic Partnership Council (2019), defence cooperation agreements, regular joint exercises.
  * Energy partnership: Saudi is a top crude supplier; investment in India’s refining & petrochemicals.
* **India’s regional policy**:

  * *Link West* policy – balancing ties with Saudi, Iran, Israel, UAE.
  * Engagement in multipolar West Asia (BRICS+, I2U2 grouping).
* **Pakistan–Saudi history**:

  * Decades of military cooperation; Pakistani troops stationed in Saudi Arabia in past.
  * Riyadh has often funded Pakistan during economic crises.
  * Fears of Saudi nuclear ambitions have long been tied to Pakistan’s nuclear capacity.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

* **Security implications**:

  * Raises the spectre of **Saudi legitimisation of Pakistan’s military posture** vis-à-vis India.
  * Could indirectly provide political cover to Pakistan’s use of terrorism and military provocations.
* **Geopolitical challenges**:

  * India’s belief that growing outreach to Gulf states would reduce Pakistan’s influence seems overstated.
  * Religious-ideological factors (Sunni solidarity) still underpin Riyadh–Islamabad ties.
* **Energy & economic stakes**:

  * India imports >18% of crude oil from Saudi; any political strain risks energy security.
* **Strategic autonomy**:

  * Riyadh’s multipolar approach (less dependence on U.S., hedging with Pakistan, China, Russia) parallels India’s but may clash with Indian security interests.
* **Diplomatic test**:

  * India’s cautious, “pacifist” stance risks limiting manoeuvrability in volatile geopolitics.
  * Growing risk that fence-sitting could reduce India’s leverage in shaping West Asian order.

### 5. **Way Forward**

* **Recalibrate West Asia policy**:

  * Deepen **institutional economic and security ties** with Saudi Arabia to prevent Pakistan from monopolising Riyadh’s military partnerships.
  * Expand role in **energy transition projects** (green hydrogen, renewables) to lock Saudi investments.
* **Enhance strategic signalling**:

  * Balance pacifism with clear red lines on **terrorism sponsorship**.
  * Project credible deterrence through **defence modernisation and partnerships** (e.g., with Israel, France, U.S.).
* **Engage multilaterally**:

  * Leverage **BRICS+, SCO, I2U2** to keep India central to Gulf’s multipolar calculus.
  * Strengthen outreach to **Iran and UAE** to counterbalance Riyadh–Islamabad tilt.
* **Domestic resilience**:

  * Secure energy supply diversification (Africa, Latin America).
  * Reduce vulnerability of Indian diaspora in Gulf (~8 million workers).
* **Strategic risk-taking**:

  * Move beyond reactive diplomacy to **proactive regional shaping**, including **naval presence in Arabian Sea** and **economic corridors** (India–Middle East–Europe corridor).

* Defence Ministry emphasised India’s advantage in **MRO (Maintenance, Repair, Overhaul)** of Russian-origin systems, widely used in Africa.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Policy measures**:

  * *Defence Production & Export Promotion Policy (DPEPP) 2020* → aims for ₹35,000 crore defence exports by 2025.
  * *Atmanirbhar Bharat* and *Innovation for Defence Excellence (iDEX)* → boost indigenous platforms.
  * 100% FDI permitted in defence manufacturing (74% automatic route).
* **Defence diplomacy**:

  * Regular **India–Africa Defence Dialogue** at DefExpo.
  * *India–Africa Field Training Exercises (AFINDEX)*.
  * Lines of Credit extended for defence procurement in Africa.
* **Past milestones**:

  * Defence attachés deployed in African capitals.
  * Focus on exporting small arms, naval patrol vessels, UAVs, and protective equipment.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

* **Strategic significance**:

  * Enhances India’s footprint in Africa → balances China’s deep engagement and Turkey’s growing influence.
  * Provides alternative to Russian dominance in African arms market.
* **Economic impacts**:

  * Boosts defence exports → aligns with India’s target of becoming a **net exporter** of defence equipment.
  * Opportunity to expand into ancillary markets (spare parts, servicing).
* **Geopolitical dimension**:

  * Morocco positions India within **North Africa–Europe trade corridors**.
  * Supports India’s aspiration to be seen as a **neutral, reliable partner** outside U.S.–China or Russia–West blocs.
* **Security cooperation**:

  * Potential for **joint training, maritime security** in the Atlantic approaches.
  * Creates goodwill through job creation in Morocco and technology partnerships.
* **Challenges**:

  * African defence budgets are limited; affordability crucial.
  * Competition from China (cheaper exports, tied financing).

# Cooling rights in a sweltering South
## India’s Cooling Policy and Climate Justice

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Cooling & ACs**:

  * Cooling is not just a comfort; it’s a **public health safeguard** and an **adaptation measure** to climate change.
  * Air conditioning demand is rising due to **heatwaves, urbanisation, and economic growth**.
* **BEE’s 2025 proposal**:

  * All new ACs must work between **20–28°C**; default at **24°C**.
  * Aim: save **20 billion units of electricity**, worth **₹10,000 crore**, and cut **16 million tonnes of CO₂ emissions annually**.
* **Equity issue**:

  * In India, **AC access is limited**: ~5% households own ACs (13% urban, 1% rural in 2021).
  * Ownership is concentrated in the **urban rich** → richest 10% own 72% of all ACs.
* **Global divide**:

  * U.S./Japan: ~90% households have ACs.
  * Central & South America: ~22%.
  * Sub-Saharan Africa: ~6%.
  * Per capita cooling energy use: U.S. = **28x India**.

### 2. **The News**

* **June 2025**: Govt. of India proposed new AC rules (temperature range 20–28°C, 24°C default).
* BEE highlighted **massive energy & emissions savings**.
* Critics argue: Policy frames cooling mainly as **energy-efficiency/mitigation issue**, while ignoring **universal access** for vulnerable groups.
* Broader context:

  * **Heat-related deaths** (2000–2019): ~489,000 globally; >20,000 in India.
  * WHO warns: Lack of cooling infrastructure undermines **healthcare, labour productivity, and livelihoods**.
  * Europe is rapidly expanding AC ownership post-heatwaves, while the Global South is pressured to restrict its cooling demand.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **India Cooling Action Plan (ICAP, 2019)**:

  * First such plan in the world.
  * Targets: reduce cooling demand by 25–40% by 2037–38; training & R&D for sustainable cooling.
* **Energy Efficiency Measures**:

  * BEE star-labelling for appliances.
  * Energy Conservation Act amendments.
* **Heat Action Plans (HAPs)**: Implemented in Gujarat, Odisha, and other States → early warning systems, heat shelters, awareness drives.
* **Global frameworks**:

  * Kigali Amendment (2016) → phase-down HFCs (potent greenhouse gases).
  * India committed to phasedown schedule but with equity considerations.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

* **Economic dimension**:

  * Energy savings from efficiency vs. inequities in AC ownership.
  * Productivity loss among outdoor workers → agriculture, construction, informal sector (~80% of Indian workforce).
* **Public health**:

  * Extreme heat increases cardiovascular, renal, respiratory illnesses.
  * Hospitals in low/middle-income countries lack reliable power → neonatal care, vaccine storage at risk.
* **Equity & climate justice**:

  * Developed nations justify AC expansion as adaptation, but pressure the South to treat it as a climate liability.
  * Raises North–South tensions in climate negotiations.
* **Governance**:

  * HAPs face funding & institutional gaps.
  * Lack of **universal cooling infrastructure** → vulnerable groups remain exposed.
* **Ethical aspect**:

  * Cooling as a **development right**, not a privilege of elites.

### 5. **Way Forward**

* **For India**:

  * Expand **affordable, efficient cooling access** for poor & rural households.
  * Strengthen **Heat Action Plans** with legal backing, financing, and labour protections.
  * Build **public cooling centres** (like shelters, hospitals, schools).
  * Promote **passive cooling** (green buildings, insulation, urban greening).
  * Incentivise **low-GWP refrigerants** and domestic innovation.
* **For Global South**:

  * Frame cooling as **adaptation necessity** in climate negotiations.
  * Push for **climate finance** and **technology transfer** from developed countries.
* **For Global North**:

  * Provide **funding & concessional finance** for cooling infrastructure in vulnerable countries.
  * Avoid double standards (expanding AC use at home while restricting others).
* **Long-term**:

  * Treat cooling as part of **UN Sustainable Development Goals** (health, equity, climate action).
  * Integrate **cooling access** into public health and labour welfare systems.

# Why India’s urban definition is failing its growing towns
## Census 2027 and the Definition of Urban India

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Census definition (2011)**:

  * **Statutory town**: Declared urban by State govt. → governed by municipal corporation, council, nagar panchayat.
  * **Census town**: Meets 3 criteria but remains under rural administration:

    1. Population ≥ 5,000.
    2. ≥ 75% male main workers in non-agriculture.
    3. Population density ≥ 400 persons/sq. km.
* **Issue**: India uses a **binary rural–urban classification**, ignoring the fluid, transitional settlements in between.
* **Reality**: Rapid urbanisation has created **peri-urban, semi-urban, and clustered settlements** that function like towns but remain “rural” on paper.

### 2. **The News**

* **August 14, 2025**: Registrar General of India (RGI) informed States that the **2027 Census will retain the 2011 urban definition**.
* **Reason given**: Ensure comparability of data over time.
* **Problem**: Risks misclassifying millions as “rural,” underestimating India’s actual level of urbanisation.
* **Evidence**:

  * West Bengal: 251 census towns (2001) remained under rural governance in 2011, despite fulfilling urban criteria.
  * 2011: India’s urban population recorded as 31%; but alternative methods suggest 35–57%.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **73rd & 74th Constitutional Amendments (1992)**:

  * Created **Panchayati Raj institutions** (rural) and **Urban Local Bodies (ULBs)**.
  * Gave ULBs more autonomy & financial powers.
* **Smart Cities Mission & AMRUT**: Urban development schemes, but only for statutory towns.
* **Census & NSS data**: Used for urban planning, resource allocation, delimitation of constituencies.
* **Gap**: No strong policy framework for **census towns/peri-urban areas** → left out of urban governance reforms.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

* **Governance challenges**:

  * Settlements with urban traits lack ULBs → poor infrastructure, services, and planning.
  * Panchayats in such areas lack powers to plan for urban needs.
* **Equity & development**:

  * Misclassification denies access to schemes meant for urban areas (housing, sanitation, water, transport).
  * Excludes women’s work and informal/gig economy jobs from formal recognition.
* **Data reliability**:

  * Skewed urbanisation data → flawed policies, underpreparedness for migration and urban sprawl.
* **Federal implications**:

  * States reluctant to municipalise census towns (ULBs imply local elections, more accountability).
* **Climate & resilience**:

  * Peri-urban areas face highest exposure to **heat stress, floods, pollution**, but lack urban-level adaptation planning.

### 5. **Way Forward**

* **Redefine “urban”**:

  * Include criteria beyond population size, density, and male non-farm work.
  * Consider **commuting patterns, women’s work, service-sector jobs, gig economy presence, housing quality, infrastructure access**.
* **Tiered classification**:

  * Move from binary rural–urban → multi-tier (rural, semi-urban, peri-urban, urban).
  * Adopt a **continuum approach**, as seen in UN-Habitat frameworks.
* **Municipalisation push**:

  * Incentivise States to convert census towns into statutory towns.
  * Strengthen ULB finances via **Finance Commission grants, property tax reforms**.
* **Data innovation**:

  * Use **remote sensing, satellite imagery, mobility data** to identify urban clusters.
  * Combine Census with **Economic Census & NSS surveys** for real-time settlement mapping.
* **Inclusive planning**:

  * Recognise peri-urban areas in urban schemes (Smart Cities, AMRUT).
  * Ensure **heat action plans, climate resilience projects, and transport services** extend to transitional settlements.
