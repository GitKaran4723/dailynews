# President urges restraint as crisis persists in Nepal
## Nepal’s Gen Z Movement and the Political Crisis

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Nepal’s Political Context**: Nepal is a parliamentary democracy with a multi-party system. Its politics have often been unstable, with frequent changes of government.
* **Gen Z Movement**: A youth-led movement primarily organized online, representing frustration against corruption, misgovernance, and restrictions on freedoms. The movement gained momentum after the **Oli government banned social media platforms**, which Gen Z perceived as an attack on free expression.
* **Interim Government**: When a government collapses due to resignation or vote of no-confidence, an interim (temporary) administration is usually set up to stabilize governance until fresh elections or a permanent arrangement is made.
* **Constitutional Angle**: The President is a ceremonial head of state but plays a key role in government formation. The Army is generally apolitical, but its appointment as negotiator raises constitutional concerns.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

* **Issues & Challenges**:

  * Acute shortage of trained professionals.
  * Inconsistent service quality in helplines.
  * Stigma discouraging people from seeking help.
  * Social determinants — poverty, gender inequity, unemployment, exam stress.
* **Impacts**:

  * **Positive**: More awareness, growing willingness to seek psychiatric help, early interventions via helplines.
  * **Limitations**: Without systemic reforms, helplines alone cannot reduce suicide rates sustainably.
* **Ethical Concerns**: Need for privacy, dignity, and respect in handling calls. Risk of harm if a helpline fails to respond during crisis.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Human Resources**: Train more clinical psychologists, psychiatric nurses, and counsellors; incentivise specialists to serve in rural areas.
2. **Integration**: Embed helplines within a **continuum of care** — from immediate counselling to referral for therapy, medication, and community follow-up.
3. **School & College Programmes**: Establish strong, stigma-free mental health support systems for students.
4. **Community Participation**: Expand gatekeeper models where trained community members can spot early warning signs.

# Can vultures help prevent pandemics?
## Vultures, Biodiversity, and Pandemic Preparedness

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Role of Vultures**:

  * Nature’s waste managers, cleaning carcasses before pathogens spread.
  * Prevent zoonotic spillovers like **anthrax, botulism, and rabies**.
  * Keystone species in ecosystems.
* **Population Decline**:

  * From \~40 million in 1980s to <5% of that today.
  * Key driver: **Diclofenac** (a veterinary painkiller) which proved toxic to vultures.
* **Central Asian Flyway (CAF)**:

  * A migration route used by vultures and other raptors across 30+ countries.
  * Links ecosystems — but also spreads disease risks if carcass dumps and landfills are unmanaged.
* **One Health Concept**:

  * Integrates **human, animal, and environmental health**.
  * Vulture conservation is a “One Health” measure, preventing outbreaks at the interface of wildlife and human settlements.

---

### 2. **The News**

* As India’s **National Action Plan for Vulture Conservation (2016–25)** nears completion, experts highlight vultures’ role in **pandemic preparedness**.
* Proposal for a **post-2025 strategy**:

  * Vultures not just as conservation targets but as **public health allies**.
  * Focus on surveillance, data integration, community partnerships, and transboundary coordination.
* India’s CAF vultures (Himalayan griffon, cinereous vulture, Eurasian griffon) give the country a central role in regional conservation.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **National Action Plan for Vulture Conservation (2016–2025)**:

  * Phased ban on veterinary diclofenac.
  * Establishment of **Vulture Safe Zones** and captive breeding centres.
* **International Cooperation**:

  * Commitments under the **Convention on Migratory Species (CMS)** for CAF protection.
* **One Health Approach**:

  * NCDC (National Centre for Disease Control) leading integrated disease surveillance.
  * Still limited formal recognition of vultures in health security planning.
* **Infrastructure Mitigation**: Some states testing bird-safe pylons and carcass management initiatives.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

* **Issues & Challenges**:

  * Lack of funding for vulture conservation.
  * Fragmented efforts, weak coordination between wildlife and health agencies.
  * Persistent risks from power line electrocution, poisoning, and unsafe veterinary drugs.
* **Impacts**:

  * **Ecological**: Decline disrupts carcass disposal, leading to feral dog population explosions.
  * **Public Health**: Increased disease spillover risk from rotting carcasses.
  * **Regional Security**: CAF spans 30+ countries, making this a transboundary health issue.
* **Ethical & Governance Concerns**:

  * Recognition of biodiversity as a public health asset.
  * Need for participatory models where communities benefit from conservation.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Next-Gen Vulture Strategy (post-2025)**:

   * Satellite telemetry to map carcass hotspots.
   * **Decision Support System (DSS)** integrating wildlife-livestock-human health data.
   * Inclusion of vultures in **pandemic preparedness plans**.
2. **Infrastructure & Veterinary Reforms**:

   * Bird-safe powerlines and pylons.
   * Ban on toxic NSAIDs beyond diclofenac (like ketoprofen, aceclofenac).
3. **One Health Framework**:

   * Strengthen coordination across **environment, veterinary, and health ministries**.
   * Position vulture conservation as a **low-cost pandemic prevention tool**.
4. **Transboundary Cooperation**:

   * Joint CAF-level initiatives with Central Asia and South Asia.

# Why are European nations now moving to recognise Palestine?
## European Recognition of Palestine

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **State Recognition**: A formal act where a country acknowledges another political entity as a sovereign state under international law.
* **Two-State Solution**: Long-standing international consensus for peace — an independent Palestine alongside Israel.
* **European Context**: EU requires unanimity in foreign policy, making collective recognition impossible; individual states act independently.
* **Symbolism**: Recognition does not immediately alter ground realities but shifts **diplomatic legitimacy** and signals pressure on Israel.

---

### 2. **The News**

* **Spain, Ireland, and Norway** have formally recognised **Palestine as a state**.
* This recognition wave has pushed **France** to declare readiness for recognition “at a useful moment.”
* Triggers:

  * The **Gaza war after October 7, 2023**.
  * Israel’s rejection of the **two-state solution**.
  * **ICJ proceedings** accusing Israel of genocide.
* **Domestic and regional effects**:

  * Massive public protests across Europe.
  * Calls for moral consistency after Europe’s stand on Ukraine.
  * EU-level divisions mean recognition proceeds country by country.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Individual States**:

  * Spain, Ireland, and Norway coordinated their announcement for greater impact.
  * Earlier recognitions: Sweden (2014); Eastern European states like Poland, Hungary recognised Palestine during the Cold War.
* **European Union**:

  * No collective recognition due to lack of unanimity.
  * EU continues to officially support a negotiated two-state solution.
* **Global Frameworks**:

  * **UN General Assembly** (2012): Palestine granted *non-member observer state* status.
  * **ICJ hearings**: Influence European decision-making by highlighting legal dimensions.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

* **Issues & Challenges**:

  * Lack of unity within the EU weakens collective leverage.
  * Holocaust legacy constrains Germany and Austria from pushing recognition.
  * U.S. influence continues to shape many European states’ caution.
* **Impacts**:

  * **Diplomatic**: Legitimises Palestinian statehood internationally, isolates Israel further.
  * **Political**: Signals responsiveness to domestic activism, especially among youth.
  * **Geopolitical**: Exposes contradictions between Europe’s stance on Ukraine vs. Palestine.
  * **Ethical**: Recognition aligns Europe’s policies with international law and human rights discourse.
* **India Angle**: India recognised Palestine in 1988 and balances ties with both Israel and Palestine — Europe’s shift resonates with India’s long-standing two-state support.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Broader Coordination**: Encourage more European nations to join recognition, creating cumulative diplomatic weight.
2. **EU-Level Strategy**: Even if formal consensus is impossible, EU should frame a stronger **collective humanitarian and legal position**.
3. **Internationalisation**: Push for UN Security Council discussions, linking recognition with support for ceasefire and reconstruction in Gaza.
4. **Dialogue & Pressure**: Use recognition to pressure Israel back towards serious negotiations.
5. **Bridge-Building**: Europe can position itself as a mediator between Palestinian leadership and Israel, balancing moral credibility with diplomatic influence.
