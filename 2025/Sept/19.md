# Equalising primary food consumption in India
## Poverty Measurement and Food Deprivation in India

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Poverty measurement approaches**: Traditionally in India, poverty has been measured using a calorie-based method (minimum calorie intake needed for survival). Internationally, the World Bank uses an income/consumption threshold (currently \$2.15/day for extreme poverty).
* **Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES)**: Conducted by the National Sample Survey (NSS), it collects data on household spending. After a gap of over 10 years, the 2024 survey gave updated data for poverty measurement.
* **World Bank estimate (2025)**: Extreme poverty in India fell from **16.2% (2011-12) to 2.3% (2022-23)**, suggesting near elimination of extreme poverty.
* **Thali Index**: Instead of calories, some researchers use the affordability of a balanced Indian meal (thali) as a metric of real food consumption. A thali (rice, dal, vegetables, roti, curd, salad) is estimated to cost about **₹30 (Crisil)**.

### 2. **The News**

* The **World Bank (April 2025)** reported a drastic decline in poverty in India, citing extreme poverty at just 2.3%.
* A **study based on the 2024 HCES**, however, found that:

  * **50% of rural households** and **20% of urban households** could not afford two thalis per person per day.
  * Even after accounting for **Public Distribution System (PDS)** supplies, deprivation remained high (**40% rural, 10% urban**).
* This contradiction suggests that **income-based measures may underestimate food deprivation**.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Public Distribution System (PDS):** Provides subsidised rice, wheat, and coarse grains to \~80 crore people under the National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013.
* **Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY):** Free 5 kg of foodgrains per month for beneficiaries (extended in 2024).
* **Pulse Distribution Schemes:** Limited and state-specific, not universalised like cereals.
* **Other Nutrition Programs:** Mid-Day Meal Scheme, Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS), and Poshan Abhiyaan.
* **Reforms suggested in study:**

  * Reduce excessive cereal entitlements (since cereal consumption has plateaued).
  * Redirect subsidies to **pulses**, a protein-rich but costly food item.
  * Make subsidies **progressive** — targeted at the poorest, instead of near-universal.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

* **Issues & Challenges:**

  * Divergence between **income poverty reduction** and **actual food/nutrition deprivation**.
  * **Inefficient subsidy structure** — cereals oversupplied, pulses undersupplied.
  * **Leakages and inequity** — higher-income groups also benefit substantially from subsidies.
  * Fiscal burden of **large food subsidy bill** (\~₹2-3 lakh crore annually).
* **Impacts:**

  * **Social**: Persistent malnutrition, especially protein deficiency.
  * **Economic**: Misallocation of resources, reduced fiscal space for education/health.
  * **Polity**: Food subsidies remain politically sensitive — trimming them risks backlash.
  * **Ethics & Governance**: Subsidy misuse by non-poor raises equity concerns.
* **UPSC Angle:** Links with **GS II (Governance, Welfare Schemes, Poverty & Hunger)** and **GS III (Economy, Food Security, Agriculture, Subsidies, Inclusive Growth)**.

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Redesign Subsidy Framework**

   * Trim universal cereal entitlement; focus on the **bottom 40%** of the population.
   * Shift from calorie security to **nutrition security** (pulses, millets, edible oils).

2. **Strengthen Targeting Mechanisms**

   * Use updated HCES data, Aadhaar-linked databases, and SECC for identifying needy households.
   * Introduce **graded subsidy** (higher for poorest, none for top 20%).

3. **Expand Pulses in PDS**

   * Ensure at least **½ kg pulses per person per month**, given its role as primary protein source.
   * Encourage procurement from farmers under MSP to boost both demand and supply.

4. **Nutrition-Sensitive Interventions**

   * Integrate PDS reforms with **Poshan Abhiyaan** and school/ICDS meals.
   * Encourage **diet diversification** beyond cereals.

5. **Fiscal Sustainability**

   * Rationalise food subsidy bill to free resources for **health, education, and infrastructure**.
   * Reduce FCI stocking costs by curbing excess procurement of cereals.

# Holistic approach
## Stubble Burning and Air Pollution Management

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Stubble burning**: Farmers burn leftover paddy straw (stubble) after harvesting the kharif crop (mainly rice) to quickly clear fields for sowing the rabi crop (mainly wheat).
* **Why farmers burn stubble?**

  * Short sowing window between rice harvest (Oct) and wheat planting (Nov).
  * High cost of manual/mechanical removal.
  * Lack of alternative uses for stubble.
* **Impact on air quality**: Releases **PM2.5 and PM10 particles**, carbon monoxide, and greenhouse gases, worsening Delhi-NCR’s already poor winter air.
* **Institutional mechanism**:

  * **Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM)** (2020) covers Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, UP, Rajasthan for coordinated action.
  * **Supreme Court** often intervenes when state/central agencies fail.

### 2. **The News**

* The **Supreme Court** has suggested **prosecuting farmers** who engage in stubble burning, arguing no citizen is above the law.
* Context: Each October-November, Delhi-NCR faces a toxic smog crisis due to combined emissions from vehicles, industry, and especially stubble burning.
* The **CAQM**, though empowered to act, has failed to enforce decisions effectively and has been seen as politically constrained.
* Punjab allegedly under-reported stubble burning incidents, and CAQM did not act transparently.
* Earlier, CAQM’s order on banning petrol/diesel sale to old vehicles was also delayed due to political pushback.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **CAQM Act, 2020**: Central body for regional coordination.
* **Subsidy schemes**:

  * Financial support for **Happy Seeder, Super Straw Management System, balers** (to remove/reuse stubble).
  * Central Sector Scheme on **Crop Residue Management** (since 2018).
* **In-situ solutions**: PUSA bio-decomposer (IARI innovation to decompose stubble).
* **Ex-situ solutions**: Using stubble for biomass power plants, ethanol production, packing material.
* **National Clean Air Programme (NCAP)** (2019): Reduce particulate pollution by 40% by 2026.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

* **Issues & Challenges**:

  * **Economic distress**: Small and marginal farmers lack resources for alternatives.
  * **Weak enforcement**: State govts avoid strict action fearing farmer backlash.
  * **Institutional failure**: CAQM lacks independence and transparency.
  * **Data manipulation**: Punjab under-reporting fires undermines credibility.
* **Impacts**:

  * **Environmental**: Worsens PM2.5 levels; contributes to climate change.
  * **Health**: Respiratory diseases, reduced life expectancy in NCR.
  * **Economic**: Lost workdays, increased health expenditure.
  * **Political**: Centre–State blame game, lack of accountability.
* **Ethics & Governance**:

  * Balancing **farmers’ livelihood concerns** with **citizens’ right to clean air**.
  * Risk of criminalising farmers instead of addressing structural issues.

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Reform Incentives**

   * Link subsidies directly to adoption of **Happy Seeder/bio-decomposer**.
   * MSP reform: Encourage less water-intensive crops (millets, maize) to reduce paddy area.

2. **Targeted Enforcement**

   * Penalise **large landholding farmers** who burn stubble despite access to machinery.
   * Ensure **support mechanisms** for small/marginal farmers instead of blanket criminalisation.

3. **Transparency & Accountability**

   * Independent monitoring of stubble fires using **satellite data** with real-time public disclosure.
   * CAQM to publish **annual performance reviews** of state compliance.

4. **Alternative Uses for Stubble**

   * Scale up biomass energy plants, compressed biogas (CBG), ethanol blending projects.
   * Promote stubble-based industries (packaging, paper, mushroom cultivation).

5. **Collaborative Governance**

   * Strengthen CAQM as a **truly independent statutory authority**.
   * Involve **panchayats, farmer cooperatives, NGOs** in awareness and management.

* **Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) & LaQshya:** To reduce MMR by promoting institutional deliveries.
* **Digital health initiatives:** Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM), telemedicine platforms like e-Sanjeevani.
* **School Health Programme:** Under Ayushman Bharat, aims at health promotion in schools.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

* **Issues & Challenges:**

  * Unequal health access between urban-rural, rich-poor, tribal-mainstream.
  * High OOP expenditure pushing families into poverty.
  * Infrastructure gaps: shortage of doctors, specialists, and functioning PHCs.
  * Preventive care, mental health, and awareness remain weak.
  * Cultural barriers and stigma hinder utilisation of available services.
* **Impacts:**

  * **Social:** Persistent maternal/child mortality and malnutrition.
  * **Economic:** Productivity loss due to ill health; poverty from high OOP spending.
  * **Governance:** Weak policy coordination across states; inadequate health financing (\~1.8% of GDP).
  * **Ethics:** Balancing equity (universal access) with efficiency (resource constraints).

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Universal Health Coverage (UHC):**

   * Expand PM-JAY to cover more households and services.
   * Reduce OOP costs via public funding and insurance expansion.

# Why did India condemn Doha strike?
## India’s Condemnation of Israel’s Strike in Doha

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Context of West Asia conflict:** Israel’s ongoing war in Gaza has spilled into neighbouring countries through targeted strikes against Hamas and Hezbollah operatives.
* **Sovereignty principle:** Under international law (UN Charter), nations must respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other states. Cross-border strikes, unless in self-defence, are considered violations.
* **India’s traditional stance:** Balanced diplomacy — strong ties with **Israel** (defence, technology, agriculture) and **Arab Gulf states** (energy, diaspora, trade). Normally, India avoids strong criticism of Israel, instead calling for restraint and dialogue.

### 2. **The News**

* On **September 16, 2025**, India’s representative at the UNHRC condemned Israel’s **September 9 bombing in Doha, Qatar**, calling it a **“violation of sovereignty”**.
* This marked a shift from India’s usually **muted or cautious responses** to similar Israeli strikes in **Lebanon, Iran, Syria, Yemen, and Tunisia**.
* India’s reaction is linked to:

  * **Strong bilateral ties with Qatar** (major LNG supplier, host to 8 lakh Indians, close Modi–Emir ties).
  * Regional instability following the **Saudi–Pakistan mutual defence pact** signed days earlier.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Foreign Policy Moves:**

  * PM Modi spoke directly with Qatar’s Emir on September 10, expressing solidarity.
  * India voted **in favour of the UNGA resolution** supporting a two-state solution for Palestine (Sept 12, 2025).
  * At the same time, India has avoided strongly condemning Israel’s actions in Gaza, apart from mild concern on civilian/journalist deaths.
* **Energy Diplomacy:**

  * Qatar supplies \~40% of India’s LNG imports.
  * Strategic energy partnership agreements ensure India’s energy security.
* **Diaspora Factor:**

  * \~8–9 lakh Indians work in Qatar, sending significant remittances.
* **Multilateral Engagement:**

  * India balances its role in **OIC, SCO, BRICS**, and its **strategic partnership with the U.S. and Israel**.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

* **Issues & Challenges:**

  * **Balancing Act:** India’s Israel partnership (defence, technology) vs. dependence on Gulf states (energy, diaspora, remittances).
  * **Credibility:** Differing reactions to sovereignty violations (Qatar vs. Iran, Lebanon) raise questions about consistency in India’s foreign policy.
  * **Regional Security:** Israel’s attacks risk destabilising Gulf states hosting U.S. bases; this shifts Gulf perceptions of U.S. reliability.
  * **Geopolitics:** Saudi–Pakistan defence pact adds complexity to India’s regional strategy.
* **Impacts:**

  * **Diplomatic:** Condemning Israel could strain ties with Tel Aviv.
  * **Economic:** LNG and remittances from Qatar and other Gulf states make neutrality costly.
  * **Strategic:** India cannot afford alienation in a region central to its **energy, diaspora, and connectivity projects (like Chabahar, IMEC corridor)**.
* **Ethics & Governance:**

  * Dilemma of **principled foreign policy (sovereignty, human rights)** vs. **transactional diplomacy (energy, diaspora, strategic partnerships)**.

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Principled Consistency:** India should emphasise adherence to **international law and sovereignty** across all conflicts, to avoid charges of selective outrage.
2. **Strengthen Gulf Ties:** Deepen energy and security cooperation with Qatar, UAE, and Saudi Arabia while carefully watching Saudi–Pakistan military cooperation.
3. **Balanced Messaging on Gaza:** While maintaining strategic partnership with Israel, India must highlight humanitarian concerns and support the two-state solution.
4. **Regional Multilateral Role:** Use platforms like **BRICS, SCO, UN, and I2U2** (India–Israel–UAE–U.S.) to push for de-escalation.
5. **Strategic Autonomy:** Reinforce India’s stance as an **independent global actor**, not aligning fully with either U.S.–Israel or Arab–Iran blocs.

# Why are Maharashtra’s onion farmers protesting?
## Onion Farmers’ Protest in Maharashtra

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Why onions matter?** India is one of the world’s largest onion producers, with Maharashtra contributing over one-third of the output. Onions are both a staple food item and politically sensitive — sudden price rise or fall triggers public concern.
* **Seasonality of production:**

  * *Rabi onions* (harvested March–May) are the main crop, stored to ensure supply throughout the year.
  * If prices crash or stored onions deteriorate, farmers face heavy losses.
* **Government’s onion price stabilisation mechanism:** Uses the **Price Stabilisation Fund (PSF)**, managed via **NAFED and NCCF**, to procure onions, build a buffer stock, and release them in the market when prices rise.
* **Problem:** While this protects consumers, it can hurt farmers when buffer stock is released during a glut, pushing prices down further.

### 2. **The News**

* Since **September 12, 2025**, thousands of farmers in Maharashtra have launched a **phone protest** demanding:

  * Immediate aid of **₹1,500 per quintal**.
  * Stop NCCF/NAFED from selling government buffer stock in cities.
* Farmers currently earn **₹800–₹1,000 per quintal**, while **production cost is ₹2,200–₹2,500**.
* Rabi onions stored in anticipation of higher prices are deteriorating, forcing distress sales.
* Exports have collapsed from **25.25 lakh tonnes (2022–23)** to **11.47 lakh tonnes (2024–25)**, as Bangladesh and Sri Lanka turned to alternative suppliers due to India’s policy flip-flops.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Price Stabilisation Fund (2014):** Maintains buffer stock of perishable crops like onion and pulses to check volatility.
* **NAFED & NCCF role:** Procurement, storage, and market release of onions.
* **Export controls:** India frequently imposes bans, minimum export prices, or stock limits to control domestic inflation. This, however, makes India an unreliable supplier in global markets.
* **Andhra Pradesh model (2025):** Procurement at **₹1,200 per quintal** to provide farmers a floor price.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

* **Issues & Challenges:**

  * *Farmer distress*: Prices below cost of production = indebtedness and protests.
  * *Policy inconsistency*: Frequent export bans undermine India’s credibility, reducing long-term market share.
  * *Consumer–farmer trade-off*: Price stabilisation benefits consumers but penalises producers.
  * *Storage losses*: Inadequate cold storage leads to wastage and quality deterioration.
  * *Market inefficiency*: Lack of processing industries for onion-based products (dehydrated onion, powder).
* **Impacts:**

  * **Economic:** Income loss for farmers, foreign exchange loss from reduced exports.
  * **Social:** Worsening agrarian distress in Maharashtra, which has a history of farmer suicides.
  * **Political:** Onion price volatility has historically influenced elections (e.g., 1980, 1998).
* **Ethics & Governance:** Balancing the needs of **food consumers (affordability)** and **food producers (fair income)**.

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Stable Export Policy:**

   * End frequent bans; adopt a predictable export framework.
   * Negotiate **long-term contracts** with major buyers (Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Gulf countries).

2. **Farmer Support Mechanisms:**

   * Provide **direct procurement** at a remunerative base price (on lines of Andhra Pradesh).
   * Expand **price deficiency payment schemes** (similar to Madhya Pradesh’s Bhavantar).

3. **Strengthen Storage & Processing:**

   * Invest in **modern cold storage and dehydration plants**.
   * Promote onion-based **value-added industries** to absorb surpluses.

4. **Revamp Buffer Stock Policy:**

   * Release stocks strategically, without clashing with peak farmer selling periods.
   * Ensure procurement operations continue when prices dip below cost.

5. **Diversification & Risk Mitigation:**

   * Encourage crop diversification to reduce over-dependence on onions.
   * Expand crop insurance coverage for perishable crops.

# Attack on one of us is an attack on both, says Saudi-Pak. pact
## Saudi–Pakistan Mutual Defence Pact

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Mutual Defence Pact:** A formal agreement where two (or more) states pledge that an attack on one will be treated as an attack on all. (Example: NATO’s Article 5).
* **Saudi–Pakistan ties:**

  * Long-standing relations based on **religion (Islamic solidarity), economy (oil supply, remittances), and security (military cooperation)**.
  * Saudi Arabia reportedly provided **financial assistance to Pakistan’s nuclear programme** in the 1970s–80s.
  * Pakistan, in turn, has often deployed troops to defend the kingdom and trained Saudi forces.
* **Nuclear dimension:** Pakistan is the **only Muslim-majority country with nuclear weapons**. Over the years, there has been speculation that Riyadh could access Pakistan’s “nuclear umbrella” in case of regional threats, especially from Iran.

### 2. **The News**

* In **September 2025**, **Saudi Arabia and Pakistan signed a mutual defence pact**, pledging to treat an attack on either as an attack on both.
* Timing: Just days after **Israel bombed Doha (Qatar)**, escalating tensions in West Asia.
* The agreement is widely seen as:

  * A **warning to Israel**, West Asia’s only nuclear power.
  * A **reassertion of Gulf security cooperation**, amid fears that the U.S. is no longer a reliable security guarantor.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives (Contextual to India)**

* **India’s position:** Has close ties with both Saudi Arabia (energy, diaspora, investments) and Israel (defence, technology).
* **Strategic balancing:**

  * India condemned Israel’s Doha strike as a **“violation of sovereignty”**, signalling solidarity with Gulf partners.
  * India also voted in favour of the **UNGA two-state solution** resolution for Palestine (Sept 2025).
* **Regional frameworks:**

  * **GCC Joint Defence Mechanism** (revived after Doha strike).
  * **I2U2 grouping** (India, Israel, UAE, U.S.) — may face strain if Arab–Israel rift deepens.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

* **Issues & Challenges:**

  * Rising polarisation in West Asia: **Israel vs Arab–Iran axis**, now with Pakistan involved.
  * Risk of **nuclear overhang** — Saudi reliance on Pakistan’s deterrent could trigger an arms race.
  * Strains India’s **delicate balancing act**:

    * Reliance on Gulf states for **oil, LNG, and 8+ million diaspora jobs**.
    * Defence partnership with Israel.
    * Strategic ties with Iran (Chabahar port, INSTC).
* **Impacts:**

  * **Security:** Greater instability in West Asia could disrupt oil supplies, affect Indian expatriates.
  * **Diplomacy:** India may face pressure to choose sides in escalating conflicts.
  * **Geopolitics:** Undermines U.S. role as Gulf security guarantor, opens space for China/Russia.
* **Ethics & Governance:** Raises questions about nuclear responsibility and risks of proliferation when nuclear deterrence is extended informally across borders.

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **For India:**

   * Continue **principled stance on sovereignty and dialogue**, avoiding alignment with any bloc.
   * Strengthen **energy security diversification** (renewables, African/Gulf partnerships).
   * Deepen security cooperation with both Gulf and Israel while promoting de-escalation.

2. **For the Region:**

   * GCC should institutionalise **collective defence**, reducing reliance on external players.
   * Promote **Iran–Saudi dialogue** (revived in 2023 but under strain now).
   * Engage UN and major powers to prevent nuclear escalation.

3. **Global Governance:**

   * Strengthen **non-proliferation frameworks (NPT, IAEA safeguards)**.
   * Encourage confidence-building measures between Israel, Gulf states, and Iran to avoid a nuclear domino effect.
