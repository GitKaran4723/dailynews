# Karki is Nepal’s first woman PM
## Nepal’s First Woman Prime Minister: Sushila Karki Appointed Amid Political Crisis

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Political Turmoil in Nepal**: Nepal has a history of political instability since the abolition of monarchy (2008). Frequent government changes, constitutional disputes, and party power struggles often dominate politics.
* **Prime Minister Appointment & Parliament Dissolution**: In Nepal’s parliamentary democracy, the PM is usually elected by Parliament. Dissolution of Parliament is a major political step, generally tied to failure in government formation or instability.
* **Gen Z Protests**: Since early September 2025, Nepal’s youth—especially Gen Z activists—have been demanding systemic reforms, accountability, and an end to entrenched party dominance. They forced the resignation of former PM K.P. Sharma Oli.
* **Sushila Karki’s Background**: She was Nepal’s first woman **Chief Justice** (2016–2017). Known for integrity and independence, she has now become Nepal’s first **woman Prime Minister**.

### 2. **The News**

* On **Friday (Sept 12, 2025)**, Nepal’s President **Ram Chandra Poudel** appointed **former Chief Justice Sushila Karki** as the country’s new **Prime Minister**.
* At her recommendation, the President **dissolved Parliament** and announced **fresh elections for March 5, 2026**.
* This comes after days of uncertainty following the fall of **K.P. Sharma Oli’s government** on **Sept 9, 2025** due to mass **Gen Z-led protests**.
* Ms. Karki, 73, took oath at a brief ceremony and will form a **caretaker Cabinet** to oversee the elections.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Constitutional Provisions**: Nepal’s 2015 Constitution outlines government formation but is vague during crisis situations. Dissolution of Parliament has been controversial in the past.
* **Army’s Role**: The Nepal Army played a key stabilizing role during the protests, ensuring calm while facilitating consultations.
* **Past Precedents**: Nepal has seen dissolutions in 1994, 2002, and 2021—each triggering constitutional debates. The Supreme Court has at times intervened to reinstate Parliament.
* **Women in Politics**: Nepal has a history of promoting women’s political participation (33% reservation in Parliament), but this is the **first time a woman has reached the PM’s chair**.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

* **Issues & Challenges**

  * Constitutional ambiguity over Parliament dissolution and appointment of caretaker governments.
  * Youth disenchantment with mainstream political parties.
  * The balance of power between President, PM, Army, and judiciary during crises.
* **Impacts**

  * **Political**: Possible weakening of old party structures; legitimacy of youth-led movements.
  * **Society**: Symbolic empowerment of women in politics; intergenerational trust issues between old leaders and young activists.
  * **Economy**: Uncertainty may delay investment and growth, but stability could return if elections are credible.
  * **Governance**: Raises ethical issues of extra-constitutional solutions vs. people’s mandate.
* **Ethics & Governance Concerns**

  * Was dissolving Parliament democratic or opportunistic?
  * The Army’s “facilitating” role—does it risk politicization?
  * Is legitimacy derived more from legality or from public mandate during crises?

### 5. **Way Forward**

* **Strengthen Constitutional Clarity**: Amend provisions to define conditions for Parliament dissolution and caretaker governments.
* **Ensure Credible Elections**: Free, fair, and transparent elections in March 2026 are essential for stability.
* **Institutional Reforms**: Reduce over-centralization of power; enhance checks and balances between President, Parliament, and judiciary.
* **Youth Engagement**: Institutionalize channels for youth participation beyond protests (youth councils, political party reforms).
* **Gender Empowerment**: Build on Ms. Karki’s appointment by ensuring more women in leadership roles.
* **Army Neutrality**: Ensure military remains facilitator of peace, not a political actor.

Why This Fits the Glass Cliff Pattern

Tokenism vs. Real Power: Appointment may be partly symbolic to placate protesters and signal change, without addressing structural issues.

Systemic Risk Transfer: She has been handed leadership precisely when the situation is most unstable.

Potential Reinforcement of Bias: If things go wrong, it may fuel stereotypes like “women leaders can’t handle crises,” despite the fact that men in power created the mess.

So yes, Ms. Karki’s appointment can be interpreted as a clear example of the glass cliff phenomenon.

# Retail inflation quickens to 2.1%, ending 9-month drop
## Retail Inflation Rises to 2.1% in August 2025

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Retail Inflation / CPI (Consumer Price Index)**: It measures the change in prices of goods and services consumed by households. In India, it is the main inflation measure tracked by the RBI for monetary policy.
* **Comfort Band (2%–6%)**: As per the RBI Act, the **Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)** targets CPI inflation with a band of 2% (lower bound) to 6% (upper bound), aiming for 4% as the medium-term target.
* **Trends**: Since Nov 2024, retail inflation had been falling for nine consecutive months, reflecting easing food and commodity prices. August 2025 breaks this streak.

### 2. **The News**

* **What Happened**: Retail inflation rose to **2.1% in August 2025**, up from **1.55% in July 2025**.
* **Where It Stands**: This is just above the **2% lower bound** of RBI’s comfort zone.
* **Breakdown**:

  * **Food & Beverages**: 0.05% (almost flat; compared to 5.3% last year).
  * **Clothing & Footwear**: 2.67% (nearly unchanged from 2.62%).
  * **Housing**: 3.06% (marginal rise from 3.03%).
  * **Fuel & Light**: 2.9% (sharp rise from 1.4%).
* **Significance**: First uptick in inflation after nine months of decline.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Inflation Targeting**: India adopted formal inflation targeting in 2016 (RBI Act amendment) with 2%-6% band.
* **Data & Monitoring**: CPI is compiled by the **Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI)**.
* **Policy Tools**:

  * RBI uses **repo rate** and other monetary policy instruments to control inflation.
  * Government intervenes in food inflation via **buffer stocks, PDS, MSP policies, and supply-side measures**.
* **Recent Measures**: In past years, government curbs on export of rice, pulses, and edible oil stock management helped bring down food inflation.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

* **Issues & Challenges**

  * Inflation close to the lower bound may **signal weak demand** in the economy.
  * Rising fuel inflation can feed into **transportation costs**, raising overall inflation in coming months.
  * Persistent low food inflation may hurt **farmers’ incomes**, raising concerns of rural distress.
* **Impacts**

  * **Economy**: Low inflation is positive for consumers but may dampen nominal GDP growth.
  * **Polity**: Inflation management is politically sensitive — food price spikes have historically caused unrest.
  * **Social**: Urban vs. rural impact varies (food is larger share of rural consumption).
  * **Monetary Policy**: RBI may hold rates steady but will monitor if fuel-led inflation broadens.
* **Ethics & Governance**: Balancing **consumer welfare (low inflation)** with **farmer welfare (reasonable food prices)** is a key governance challenge.

### 5. **Way Forward**

* **Maintain Vigilance**: RBI should closely track whether inflationary pressures are broad-based or limited to fuel.
* **Balanced Approach**: Government must ensure farmers get remunerative prices while keeping essentials affordable.
* **Strengthen Supply Chains**: Reduce volatility in food prices through better logistics, cold storage, and digital market linkages (e-NAM).
* **Energy Diversification**: Reduce reliance on volatile fuel imports by pushing renewables and energy efficiency.
* **Demand Revival**: While inflation is low, government could use fiscal policy (infrastructure spending, rural employment) to stimulate demand without stoking runaway inflation.

# Doublespeak
## India–U.S. Trade Talks Amid Tariff Pressures and Russian Oil Dispute

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **FTA (Free Trade Agreement)**: A pact between two countries to reduce tariffs, quotas, and trade barriers, boosting investment and commerce. India and the U.S. have long discussed but never concluded an FTA.
* **Tariffs**: Taxes on imports/exports. U.S. tariffs on Indian goods (esp. textiles) are currently among the highest globally (50%).
* **Energy Security & Russian Oil**: India imports discounted crude from Russia since the Ukraine war, despite Western sanctions. For India, Russian oil = affordability + supply security. For the U.S., Indian imports = undermining sanctions.
* **Operation Sindoor & Ceasefire Context**: Broader geopolitical tensions include U.S. criticism of India’s regional operations and ties with Pakistan.

### 2. **The News**

* **What Happened**: After months of tension, the **U.S. invited Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal and team** to Washington to resume **India–U.S. FTA talks**.
* **Who Involved**: President **Donald Trump**, PM **Narendra Modi**, U.S. Secretary of State **Marco Rubio**, Ambassador-designate **Sergio Gor**, and Commerce Secretary **Howard Lutnick**.
* **When/Where**: Talks expected in Washington (date not specified).
* **Complications**:

  * U.S. insists India must **stop importing Russian oil** as a precondition for the deal.
  * Trump reportedly urged EU to impose **“100% sanctions” on India and China** to pressure Russia.
* **Economic Impact**: U.S. tariffs (50%) already hurting Indian textiles, risking **GDP loss of 0.5%** and **job losses**, per CEA V. Anantha Nageswaran.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **India’s Position**:

  * Has **previously complied** with U.S. demands on Iranian and Venezuelan oil.
  * Reluctant to repeat this with Russia due to larger dependency and geopolitical stakes.
* **Diplomatic Channels**: Modi–Trump détente signals willingness to resolve issues.
* **Institutional Mechanisms**:

  * **Trade Policy Forum (TPF)**: Bilateral platform for resolving disputes.
  * **Quad**: Security grouping (India, U.S., Japan, Australia), scheduled summit later this year — strategic context for trade talks.
* **Past Initiatives**: India pushed for GSP (Generalised System of Preferences) restoration, but U.S. has not reinstated it.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

* **Issues & Challenges**

  * Balancing **strategic autonomy** (Russia ties) with **economic pragmatism** (U.S. trade).
  * U.S. using **tariffs and oil imports** as leverage, raising sovereignty concerns.
  * Job losses and GDP slowdown if tariffs persist.
  * Credibility of U.S. as a reliable trade partner questioned due to “doublespeak.”
* **Impacts**

  * **Economic**: Tariff burden on exporters (esp. textiles), GDP hit, employment risks.
  * **Polity & Diplomacy**: Tests India’s ability to resist external pressure while protecting national interest.
  * **Strategic**: Russia–India relations vs. India–U.S. Quad partnership.
  * **Governance & Ethics**: Issue of coercive diplomacy — when does negotiation cross into diktat?
* **Global Context**: Reflects how great-power rivalry (U.S.–Russia) directly impacts middle powers’ economic policy.

### 5. **Way Forward**

* **Balanced Diplomacy**: India should engage constructively but resist ultimatums; keep **strategic autonomy** intact.
* **Diversify Energy**: Expand renewable investments, Middle East imports, and energy partnerships to reduce dependence on Russia in long term.
* **Trade Diversification**: Strengthen ties with EU, ASEAN, Africa to reduce over-dependence on U.S. markets.
* **Negotiation Leverage**: Use India’s large market and role in global supply chains as bargaining chips in talks.
* **Domestic Support**: Provide relief measures (export incentives, credit support) to industries hit by tariffs.
* **Global Forums**: Raise issue of coercive trade practices in WTO, G20, BRICS.

# The RTI’s shift to a ‘right to deny information’
## RTI Act vs. DPDP Act: Curtailing Transparency

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **RTI Act (2005):** Empowers citizens to demand information from public authorities, promoting transparency and accountability. Default rule = disclosure, with limited exemptions.
* **Section 8(1)(j) of RTI (original):** Personal information exempt if:

  * Not linked to public activity, or
  * Disclosure is an *unwarranted invasion of privacy*, unless overriding public interest.
  * Proviso: info that cannot be denied to Parliament/Legislature cannot be denied to citizens.
* **DPDP Act (2023):** Aims to protect digital personal data; overrides other laws in case of conflict. Introduces strong penalties (up to ₹250 crore) for data misuse.
* **Amendment Impact:** Section 8(1)(j) reduced to **six words** (“information which relates to personal information”). Ambiguity widens scope for denial.

### 2. **The News**

* The **DPDP Act amends Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act**, drastically shrinking it.
* Now, almost any info linked to a “person” (as per DPDP’s wide definition) can be denied.
* **Risk:** RTI becomes “Right to Deny Information (RDI)”.
* Public Information Officers (PIOs), fearing penalties, will default to denial.
* Transparency and accountability mechanisms (like checking ghost employees, pension fraud, corruption in welfare schemes) may collapse.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **RTI Act (2005):** Landmark legislation for participatory democracy.
* **Judicial Support:** Supreme Court has upheld RTI as part of Article 19(1)(a) (Right to Freedom of Speech & Expression).
* **Data Protection Push:** Government introduced DPDP to safeguard privacy post *Puttaswamy judgment (2017)* where privacy was declared a fundamental right.
* **Earlier Dilutions:** 2019 amendment reduced independence of Information Commissioners (salaries & tenure).
* **Checks on Corruption:** RTI has historically exposed scams (e.g., 2G, Commonwealth Games, MGNREGA ghost beneficiaries).

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

* **Issues & Challenges**

  * *Transparency vs. Privacy*: Ambiguous definitions tilt balance towards secrecy.
  * *PIO Discretion & Fear*: Harsh penalties incentivize denial, not disclosure.
  * *Accountability Loss*: Citizens’ role as watchdogs weakened; formal anti-corruption bodies ineffective.
  * *Legal Conflict*: DPDP’s overriding clause undermines RTI’s constitutional spirit.
* **Impacts**

  * **Society**: Citizens lose monitoring power → rise in corruption.
  * **Polity**: Weakens democratic accountability; erodes “consent of the governed.”
  * **Economy**: Leakages in welfare schemes persist unchecked.
  * **Governance**: Bureaucracy may become opaque, unresponsive.
* **Ethical Concerns**

  * Transparency as a democratic ethic vs. privacy as an individual right.
  * The danger of using “privacy” as a shield for corruption.

### 5. **Way Forward**

* **Restore Balance**: Reinstate detailed Section 8(1)(j) language, ensuring case-by-case privacy assessments.
* **Clear Definitions**: Define “personal information” narrowly in RTI context (limited to natural persons, not companies).
* **Harmonization**: Amend DPDP Act to clarify that RTI has primacy in governance-related disclosure.
* **Training & Protection**: Capacity-building for PIOs; protect them from disproportionate penalties.
* **Public Mobilization**: Civil society, media, and citizens must demand reversal of dilution.
* **Legislative Safeguards**: Political parties should commit in manifestos to restore RTI’s original scope.

---

✅ **In short:** The RTI Act once empowered citizens to “question the government”; the DPDP amendment risks reducing it to a **toothless tool**. The way forward lies in restoring balance between *privacy and transparency*, with RTI retaining primacy in governance-related information.

# Scam space
## Deepfake Cryptocurrency Scams: A New Challenge in the Digital Economy

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Deepfakes:** AI-generated manipulated videos/audio that make people appear to say or endorse things they never did. Increasingly misused for fraud.
* **Cryptocurrency Scams:** Fraudulent investment schemes promising high returns; often operate outside regulatory frameworks.
* **Digital Economy Policing:** Refers to the regulation and enforcement efforts required to maintain trust and safety in online transactions.
* **Problem:** In India, rapid smartphone penetration and low digital literacy make citizens vulnerable to scams that combine deepfakes + crypto hype.

### 2. **The News**

* In **Hyderabad**, a retired doctor lost **₹20 lakh** after investing in a fake crypto scheme, persuaded by a **deepfake video of Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman**.
* Similar deepfakes featuring other public figures are circulating on Instagram and other platforms to lure investors.
* **Gaps Identified**:

  * Regulatory vacuum in cryptocurrency classification.
  * Limited technical literacy among citizens.
  * Passive response of social media platforms.
  * Jurisdictional barriers as scammers operate abroad.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **India:**

  * **RBI** has repeatedly warned against unregulated crypto assets.
  * **Crypto taxation** introduced (30% tax + 1% TDS) to bring some oversight.
  * **IT Rules (2021, amended 2023):** Social media platforms must remove flagged content, but proactive detection is weak.
  * **National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal** for victims to lodge complaints.
* **Global:**

  * G20 (India’s presidency) has pushed for **global crypto regulation frameworks**.
  * Countries like the U.S. and EU are moving towards stricter AI-deepfake laws (e.g., EU AI Act).

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

* **Issues & Challenges**

  * **Legal Vacuum:** Cryptos not clearly defined as securities or commodities.
  * **Technology vs. Regulation Gap:** AI deepfakes advance faster than legal safeguards.
  * **Cross-Border Crime:** Scammers operate from overseas, beyond Indian jurisdiction.
  * **Platform Incentives:** Social media firms profit from engagement → delay takedowns.
  * **Awareness Deficit:** Digital literacy uneven; many fall prey to “get-rich-quick” scams.
* **Impacts**

  * **Economic:** Huge losses to individuals; reduced trust in digital financial systems.
  * **Social:** Erosion of trust in public figures when their likeness is misused.
  * **Polity:** Undermines democratic discourse (deepfakes of leaders could spread disinformation).
  * **Ethics:** Platforms prioritizing profit over user safety; scammers exploiting vulnerable populations.

### 5. **Way Forward**

* **Regulatory Clarity:** Classify cryptos under financial/securities law; strengthen **SEBI–RBI coordination**.
* **Global Cooperation:** India should push through G20/UN for **cross-border fraud enforcement** mechanisms.
* **Digital Literacy Mission:** Integrate awareness on scams/deepfakes into school curricula, community programs, and mass media.
* **Platform Accountability:** Amend IT Rules to mandate **proactive detection & takedown** of deepfake scams, with penalties for negligence.
* **Tech Solutions:** Invest in AI tools to detect manipulated media quickly.
* **Victim Support:** Create fast-track cybercrime redressal cells with compensation mechanisms.

---

✅ **In short:** Deepfake crypto scams show that the **digital economy cannot rely on self-regulation** by platforms. A combination of **clear regulation, digital literacy, proactive platform responsibility, and international cooperation** is essential to protect citizens and preserve trust.

# Property rights, tribals and the gender parity gap
## Tribal Women’s Property Rights and the Equality Debate

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Tribal Customary Laws:** In Scheduled Areas, marriage, succession, and adoption are largely governed by customary practices, not by codified laws like the Hindu Succession Act.
* **Exclusion of Women:** In most tribal societies (except some matrilineal tribes in the North-East), women are denied inheritance in ancestral property.
* **Constitutional Backdrop:** Article 14 (equality), Article 15 (non-discrimination), and Article 21 (dignity) form the basis for challenging gender exclusion. However, Article 13 allows customs to be invalidated if inconsistent with fundamental rights.
* **Judicial Position:** Courts have often hesitated to override customs due to fear of “disturbing” tribal social fabric, but recent judgments show a progressive shift.

### 2. **The News**

* On **July 17, 2025**, in *Ram Charan & Ors. vs Sukhram & Ors.*, the Supreme Court ruled that **excluding daughters from ancestral property negates their fundamental right to equality**.
* Case facts: A Gond woman’s heirs in Chhattisgarh claimed equal share in property; local courts denied citing custom. SC upheld equality and granted them share.
* **Significance:** Marks a clear step away from reliance on discriminatory customs, towards gender parity in tribal property rights.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005:** Gave equal inheritance rights to daughters, but explicitly excludes Scheduled Tribes (Sec. 2(2)).
* **PESA Act (1996):** Empowers Gram Sabhas in Scheduled Areas, but does not address gender equality in property rights.
* **Forest Rights Act (2006):** Recognizes rights of both men and women over forest land, but inheritance rules still vague.
* **Judicial Interventions:**

  * *Madhu Kishwar vs State of Bihar* (1996) – SC upheld exclusion of women, citing social disruption risk.
  * *Prabha Minz vs Martha Ekka* (2022) – Jharkhand HC upheld daughters’ property rights as custom not proven.
  * *Kamala Neti vs SLAO* (2022) – SC took affirmative stand on tribal women’s rights in land compensation.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

* **Issues & Challenges**

  * Conflict between **customary law vs. constitutional equality**.
  * Fear of land alienation to non-tribals used as justification for exclusion.
  * Low land ownership among ST women (only 16.7% compared to 83.3% for ST men).
  * Resistance to codification: tribal leaders argue land is communitarian, not individual.
* **Impacts**

  * **Social:** Perpetuates gender discrimination, economic dependency, and disempowerment of women.
  * **Economic:** Denying inheritance rights limits women’s access to productive assets, credit, and financial security.
  * **Polity:** Weakens democratic ideals of equality; creates unequal citizenship.
  * **Governance:** Unclear inheritance rights complicate land acquisition, welfare delivery, and dispute resolution.

### 5. **Way Forward**

* **Separate Tribal Succession Act:** Codify inheritance rights for tribal women, modeled on equality principles, while respecting community ownership structures.
* **Judicial Review of Customs:** Courts should test customs against constitutional morality (antiquity, reasonableness, public policy).
* **Safeguards Against Alienation:** Introduce legal safeguards preventing transfer of inherited land to non-tribals, while ensuring women’s ownership.
* **Awareness & Empowerment:** Promote legal literacy among tribal women; strengthen role of SHGs and community institutions.
* **Legislative Reforms:** Bring uniformity by harmonizing PESA, FRA, and succession rights with constitutional equality.
* **Data & Monitoring:** Strengthen gender-disaggregated land ownership data to track progress.

---

✅ **In short:** The *Ram Charan* judgment is a landmark in recognizing **tribal women’s right to equality in property inheritance**. However, without a **separate codified law** for succession in tribal societies, progress will remain piecemeal. Balancing **gender justice, tribal autonomy, and protection against land alienation** must guide future reforms.

Industry–Academia Linkages: Incentivise collaboration to ensure lab-to-market transitions.

Researcher Support: Reduce administrative burden on scientists through dedicated management cells.

Global Benchmarks: Adopt best practices from countries with high research output (e.g., NSF in the U.S., Max Planck in Germany).

✅ In short: For India to become a true Viksit Bharat by 2047, ease of doing science is as critical as ease of doing business. It requires systemic reforms in funding, governance, and autonomy so that researchers can focus on discovery and innovation instead of paperwork.
