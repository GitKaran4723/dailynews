# Pendency continues to plague SC as case backlog hits all-time high of 88,417
## Pendency in the Supreme Court

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Pendency of cases**: Refers to the number of unresolved cases awaiting judicial decision. In India, pendency has been a chronic problem across all levels of judiciary.
* **Judicial strength**: The sanctioned strength of the Supreme Court is 34 judges, the maximum ever after the 2019 amendment to the Supreme Court (Number of Judges) Act.
* **Filing vs. Disposal**: If the rate of filing fresh cases outpaces the rate of disposal, pendency rises. Even with full strength, judges face immense workload due to the wide jurisdiction of the Supreme Court (appeals, writ petitions, SLPs, constitutional matters).
* **National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG)**: A government initiative providing real-time data on pendency across courts.

### 2. **The News**

* As of September 2025, pendency in the Supreme Court has reached **88,417 cases**, the highest ever recorded.
* Of these, **69,553 are civil** and **18,864 are criminal** matters.
* In August 2025, **7,080 cases were filed**, while only **5,667 cases were disposed of** (80% disposal rate).
* Chief Justice B.R. Gavai introduced **“partial working days”** during the May–July summer recess, with 21 Benches sitting, but pendency continues to climb.
* From January to September 2025, **52,630 cases were filed** and **46,309 cases were disposed of** (\~88% disposal).
* Despite **zero vacancies** and quick appointments by the government, pendency continues rising, echoing concerns of past CJIs about the **“huge workload.”**

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Supreme Court (Number of Judges) Amendment Act, 2019**: Raised sanctioned strength to 34.
* **e-Courts Project**: Technology-driven reforms for faster hearings, digitisation, and virtual courts.
* **National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG)**: Real-time data for monitoring pendency.
* **Collegium System + Government approvals**: Recent speedy approvals of SC appointments (within 48 hours in some cases).
* **Summer Benches / Working Holidays**: Experiment introduced by CJI Gavai in 2025.
* **Pandemic-era initiatives**: Virtual hearings and hybrid courts to manage caseload.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

**Issues & Challenges**

* **Rising pendency** despite full strength → points to systemic inefficiencies.
* **Disproportionate workload** on judges due to wide jurisdiction and routine admission of Special Leave Petitions (SLPs).
* **Procedural delays**: frequent adjournments, lengthy arguments.
* **Public confidence** in judicial efficiency at risk if delays persist.
* **Comparative perspective**: Other apex courts (e.g., US Supreme Court) hear fewer cases annually (approx. 70–100), while India’s SC entertains thousands, diluting focus on constitutional matters.

**Impacts**

* **Access to justice** delayed = justice denied (Article 21 concern).
* **Economic costs**: Pending commercial disputes slow down business environment.
* **Governance**: Overburdening hampers constitutional review, affecting checks and balances.
* **Human rights**: Delay in criminal appeals affects undertrials and convicts awaiting finality.

**Ethical / Governance Concerns**

* Right to speedy justice vs. judicial capacity.
* Need for balance between accessibility of SC (open-door SLPs) and its constitutional role.

### 5. **Way Forward**

* **Case filtration & jurisdiction rationalisation**: Limit SC’s role largely to constitutional and national issues, reducing routine admission of SLPs.
* **Strengthening lower judiciary**: Reduce inflow of appeals by improving High Court and subordinate court efficiency.
* **Judicial infrastructure & technology**: Expand e-filing, AI-enabled case management, virtual benches for routine matters.
* **Institutional reforms**: Consider establishment of a **National Court of Appeals** (as suggested by Law Commission) to handle SLPs and free SC for constitutional matters.
* **Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)**: Encourage mediation, arbitration, and Lok Adalats to resolve cases before reaching apex court.
* **Performance-linked reforms**: Periodic review of disposal rates, judicial time management, and bench allocation.
* **Public legal education**: Discourage frivolous litigation and encourage settlements.

# Sliver of hope
## Saltwater Crocodile Census in the Sundarbans

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Saltwater Crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus)**: The world’s largest living reptiles, apex predators found in coastal areas, estuaries, and mangroves. They play a crucial role in maintaining aquatic food webs by regulating prey and clearing carcasses.
* **Sundarbans**: The world’s largest mangrove ecosystem (shared by India and Bangladesh), vulnerable to climate change, salinity rise, sea-level rise, and cyclones.
* **Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972**: India’s foundational law for biodiversity conservation. It provides legal protection by listing species in Schedules (Schedule I = highest protection). Initially focused on “charismatic megafauna” (tiger, elephant, lion, etc.), but later extended to lesser-known species.
* **Bhagabatpur Crocodile Project (West Bengal)**: A state-run breeding and release programme started in 1970s to revive saltwater crocodiles in the Sundarbans.

### 2. **The News**

* A **recent survey** of saltwater crocodiles in the **Sundarban Biosphere Reserve** shows a **rise in numbers and demographic diversity**.
* This indicates **successful conservation outcomes**, moving beyond the traditional focus on tigers and elephants.
* Recovery has been enabled by **legal protection under the Wildlife Act** and **site-specific interventions** such as the Bhagabatpur Crocodile Project.
* Crocodiles are now thriving despite being a **less charismatic species**, which rarely garners mass public affection.
* However, challenges remain: the Wildlife Act is **reactive**, and current provisions do not fully address **climate-linked threats** like rising salinity, habitat fragmentation, and sea-level rise.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972** – Saltwater crocodile is protected under **Schedule I**, ensuring the highest legal safeguards.
* **Bhagabatpur Crocodile Project (1970s, West Bengal)** – Captive breeding and release into the wild.
* **Sundarbans Biosphere Reserve (1989, UNESCO-recognised)** – Integrated conservation model combining mangrove and species protection.
* **Crocodile Conservation Projects (1975 onwards)** – Launched in Odisha, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal for gharials, muggers, and saltwater crocodiles.
* **National Biodiversity Action Plan (2008)** – Emphasises conserving lesser-known species.
* **CAMPA funds** and **National Adaptation Fund on Climate Change (NAFCC)** – Potential financial support mechanisms for habitat restoration and climate resilience.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

**Issues & Challenges**

* **Overemphasis on charismatic species** → neglect of reptiles, amphibians, and smaller fauna.
* **Climate change** → sea-level rise, erosion, salinity changes reducing breeding niches.
* **Anthropogenic pressures** → human settlement, aquaculture, industrial projects in the delta.
* **Reactive conservation** → protection mostly comes after species decline, not before.
* **Policy Gaps** → Current schedules under the Wildlife Act lack detailed recovery plans.

**Impacts**

* **Ecological**: Crocodile recovery indicates healthier food webs, mangrove resilience, and functioning aquatic ecosystems.
* **Conservation Learning**: Shows that non-charismatic species can recover if attention and resources are devoted.
* **Social & Governance**: Shifts conservation discourse towards inclusivity beyond tiger-centric models.
* **Climate marker**: Juvenile survival signals that breeding habitats are still viable, an important ecological indicator in climate-vulnerable Sundarbans.

### 5. **Way Forward**

* **Inclusive conservation**: Extend focus beyond flagship species to reptiles, amphibians, invertebrates.
* **Climate integration**: Anticipatory measures like identifying **climate refugia**, promoting **assisted breeding**, and protecting climate-resilient habitats.
* **Species Recovery Plans**: Each Schedule I species should have a well-funded, proactive recovery programme, not just legal protection.
* **Community engagement**: Strengthen eco-tourism and awareness so that lesser-known species gain indirect public support.
* **Strengthening science-policy linkages**: More frequent ecological surveys, better monitoring frameworks, and integration with NDMA/State Action Plans on Climate Change.
* **Learning from success**: Replicate crocodile conservation model for **other neglected taxa** (amphibians, freshwater turtles, pangolins, etc.).

  * Similar laws attempted in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Kerala.
* **Judicial interventions**: SC and HCs have struck down blanket bans, upholding the right to play “games of skill.”
* **Global practice**: Most countries adopt licensing and regulation, not outright bans.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

**Issues & Challenges**

* **Economic**: Job losses, loss of FDI, disruption of Digital India’s credibility.
* **Federalism**: Centre legislating on a *State subject* (betting & gambling). Raises constitutional propriety concerns.
* **Fundamental Rights**: Potential violation of **Article 19(1)(g)** (right to practice trade/profession).
* **Governance**: Instead of regulation, blunt prohibition may fuel illegal, unregulated markets.
* **Judicial concerns**: Distinction between “skill” and “chance” ignored by Parliament.
* **Revenue**: Loss of substantial GST and licensing revenue for both Centre and States.

**Impacts**

* **Social**: Addiction concerns remain unresolved if players migrate to illegal apps.
* **Economic**: Investors may view India as unpredictable, hurting tech ecosystem.

# How serious is the global plastic pollution crisis?
## Plastic Pollution – A Global Crisis

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Plastics**: Synthetic polymers made primarily from fossil fuels (petrochemical feedstocks). They are cheap, versatile, and widely used, but non-biodegradable.
* **Single-use plastics**: Disposable plastics (bags, bottles, straws, wrappers) with very short lifespans, yet they persist in the environment for centuries.
* **Microplastics & Nanoplastics**: Tiny fragments formed when plastics break down. They contaminate soil, water, air, and even human bodies (found in blood, lungs, placenta).
* **Plastic life cycle impact**: Production → Use → Disposal → Leakage into ecosystems → Contribution to climate change (plastics account for \~3.4% of global GHG emissions).

### 2. **The News**

* **World Environment Day 2025** (June 5) focused on *“Ending Plastic Pollution”*.
* **Scale of the problem**:

  * OECD data: Plastic production doubled from 2000–2019, reaching **460 million tonnes**; waste rose to **353 million tonnes**.
  * Only **9% recycled**, 19% incinerated, 50% landfilled, 22% leaked into environment.
  * In 2024 alone: **500 million tonnes** produced, generating **400 million tonnes** waste.
  * By 2060: waste could reach **1.2 billion tonnes**.
* **Marine crisis**: 11 million tonnes enter oceans annually; \~200 million tonnes already present. UNEP warns that by **2050, oceans may have more plastic than fish (by weight)**.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

**International**

* **UN Environment Assembly (2022)** – 193 countries agreed to work on a *legally binding global treaty* to end plastic pollution by 2024–25.
