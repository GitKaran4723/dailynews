# 13 dead as torrential rain, flash floods hit Dehradun
## Uttarakhand Flash Floods and Torrential Rain (Dehradun, September 2025)

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Flash floods**: Sudden and intense flooding caused by heavy rainfall, cloudbursts, or rapid snowmelt in hilly regions. They occur with little warning and are particularly destructive in mountainous states like Uttarakhand.
* **Red Alert by IMD**: The India Meteorological Department (IMD) issues color-coded alerts—Yellow, Orange, and Red—with Red being the highest warning, signaling extremely heavy rainfall and the need for urgent action.
* **Geographical Context**: Uttarakhand, a Himalayan state, is prone to extreme weather events—cloudbursts, landslides, flash floods—due to its fragile ecology, steep terrain, and unregulated development in tourist areas.

### 2. **The News**

* **What happened**: Torrential rain and flash floods hit Dehradun and nearby areas overnight (Monday-Tuesday).
* **Impact**:

  * At least **13 killed**, 16 missing.
  * Tourist hub **Sahastradhara** and **Tapkeshwar temple** were submerged/damaged.
  * Over **500 people rescued**, including students and tourists trapped in hotels.
  * **23+ roads blocked, bridges damaged**, major disruptions reported.
* **Who responded**: District administration, disaster relief agencies, Uttarakhand CM Pushkar Singh Dhami, PM Narendra Modi, and Union Home Minister Amit Shah pledged support.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Disaster Management Framework**:

  * National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) mobilized for rescue and evacuation.
  * **IMD forecasting** and color-coded alerts as preventive tools.
* **Schemes/Policies**:

  * *Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund (PMNRF)* for compensation.
  * *National Cyclone Risk Mitigation Project* and *National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF)* extend support in such calamities.
  * *Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015–2030)* commitments shape India’s resilience planning.
* **State Efforts**: Uttarakhand has an **Early Warning System (EWS)**, and CM personally inspected damage, directing urgent relief operations.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

* **Issues & Challenges**:

  * Unregulated construction in ecologically fragile zones (tourist markets, hotels near riverbanks).
  * Climate change intensifying extreme rainfall events in the Himalayas.
  * Lack of resilient infrastructure to withstand flash floods.
  * Challenges in timely evacuation due to night-time disasters.
* **Impacts**:

  * **Social**: Loss of lives, displacement of locals, disruption of education (students stranded).

# Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, says UN commission
## UN Report on Alleged Genocide in Gaza

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Genocide (as per UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, 1948)**:

  * Any act committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group.
  * Includes killing, causing serious bodily or mental harm, inflicting conditions to destroy a group, preventing births, and forcibly transferring children.
* **UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry (COI)**:

  * Established by the UN Human Rights Council.
  * Mandate: investigate violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and Israel.
  * It does **not represent the entire UN**, but its findings carry significant weight in international law debates.
* **Background**: The Israel-Gaza conflict has intensified since October 2023, with massive civilian casualties, destruction of infrastructure, and international allegations of war crimes.

### 2. **The News**

* On **Tuesday**, the UN Commission of Inquiry led by Navi Pillay stated that **Israel is committing genocide in Gaza**, aimed at destroying the Palestinians.
* The report accused Israel’s **Prime Minister and top officials** of incitement.
* It is the **first time a UN-mandated body** has officially used the term “genocide” against Israel.
* Israel rejected the findings, calling the report “distorted and false” and demanded the abolition of the Commission.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **International Legal Frameworks**:

  * *Genocide Convention (1948)* obligates states to prevent and punish genocide.
  * *Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC)* allows investigation and prosecution of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.
* **Ongoing Proceedings**:

  * South Africa has already filed a genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ).
  * The ICJ in January 2024 issued provisional measures directing Israel to prevent genocidal acts but stopped short of declaring genocide.
* **India’s Position**: India has generally called for restraint, humanitarian aid access, and a two-state solution, without taking a legal stance on genocide accusations.
* **UN Initiatives**: Calls for ceasefires, humanitarian corridors, and protection of civilians continue, though Security Council remains divided (US generally vetoes resolutions critical of Israel).

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

* **Issues & Challenges**:

  * Difficulty in enforcing international law—UN reports lack binding power.
  * Political divisions within the UN Security Council limit action.
  * Balancing sovereignty, self-defense claims, and human rights norms.
* **Impacts**:

  * **Global Diplomacy**: Escalates tensions between Western states (often supportive of Israel) and Global South (pushing for accountability).
  * **International Law**: Strengthens discourse on accountability and sets precedent for future cases.
  * **Humanitarian**: Increases pressure for ceasefire and aid delivery.
  * **Ethical Concerns**: Raises the issue of selective justice—some conflicts receive UN action, others do not.
* **UPSC Themes**: International Relations (UN role, ICJ jurisdiction, international humanitarian law), Ethics (human rights, accountability), Governance (India’s foreign policy choices).

### 5. **Way Forward**

* **For the UN & International Community**:

  * Ensure independent investigations with access to conflict zones.
  * Push for **humanitarian corridors** and aid delivery regardless of political positions.
  * Strengthen mechanisms for accountability through ICC and ICJ.
* **For States (including India)**:

  * Maintain a balanced diplomatic position—support humanitarian law while preserving strategic interests.
  * Enhance contributions to UN peacebuilding and humanitarian missions.
* **Long-Term**:

  * Renewed push for a **two-state solution** with international guarantees.
  * Reforms in the **UN Security Council** to prevent paralysis in humanitarian crises.

# Constitutional clarity
## Supreme Court Hearings on Presidential Reference: Governor’s Powers on Assent to Bills

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Articles 200 & 201**:

  * *Article 200*: Governor may (i) give assent to a Bill, (ii) withhold assent, (iii) return (if not a Money Bill), or (iv) reserve for President’s consideration.
  * *Article 201*: When a Bill is reserved for the President, he/she may assent or withhold assent.
  * The Constitution is **silent on timelines** for these decisions.
* **Article 143 (Presidential Reference)**: Allows the President to seek the **Supreme Court’s advisory opinion** on questions of law or public importance.
* **April 8, 2025 Judgment**: The Court held that Governors cannot indefinitely delay Bills; constitutional functionaries must act within a reasonable time to uphold democratic functioning.
* **Article 141**: Supreme Court’s judgments are binding. An advisory opinion under Article 143 does not override a judgment.

### 2. **The News**

* Hearings on the **Presidential Reference** (post-April 2025 judgment) reaffirmed that **Governors cannot indefinitely withhold assent** to State Bills.
* CJI B.R. Gavai questioned whether the Court should remain “powerless” while Governors make legislatures defunct.
* The Bench emphasized that **inaction by Governors undermines democracy**.
* States (esp. Opposition-ruled) argued that delays have been **politically selective**.
* The Centre argued Governors act as a **check on hasty legislation**, but the Bench countered this as undermining legislative primacy.
* The unusual use of Article 143 raised questions since review/curative petitions were available instead.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Judicial Precedents**:

  * *Shamsher Singh (1974)*: Governor bound by aid and advice of Council of Ministers except in exceptional circumstances.
  * *Nabam Rebia (2016)*: Governor cannot exercise discretion beyond constitutional limits.
  * *April 2025 judgment*: Explicitly held indefinite withholding of assent unconstitutional.
* **Centre’s Step**: Presidential Reference under Article 143 to seek clarity.
* **Parliamentary Developments**: Ongoing debates on codifying **time limits for Governor’s decisions**.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

* **Issues & Challenges**:

  * Federal friction: Governors seen as instruments of the Centre in Opposition-ruled States.
  * Constitutional ambiguity: Silence on timelines leads to misuse.
  * Democratic governance vs. discretionary checks.
  * Selective application raises **questions of neutrality** in constitutional offices.
* **Impacts**:

  * **Political**: Strains Centre-State relations, fuels accusations of central overreach.
  * **Legal**: Advisory vs. binding judgment tension highlights constitutional procedure.
  * **Governance**: Legislative paralysis, delayed reforms in States.
* **Ethical Concerns**: Misuse of constitutional silence for partisan advantage undermines federalism and people’s mandate.

### 5. **Way Forward**

* **Judicial Clarity**: Reaffirm binding nature of April 2025 ruling; restrict discretionary misuse by Governors.
* **Legislative Reform**: Consider constitutional amendment or legislation to prescribe a **clear timeline** (e.g., 3–6 months) for Governor’s assent decisions.
* **Institutional Balance**: Strengthen conventions of cooperative federalism—Centre must avoid using Governors for partisan gains.
* **Transparency**: Governors should provide written reasons when withholding or reserving Bills.
* **Long-Term**: Debate on restructuring Governor’s role—move towards a more **ceremonial and apolitical office**, in line with federal spirit.

# ‘Judicial experimentalism’ versus the right to justice
## Supreme Court Ruling on Section 498A/BNS 85 – Cooling Period and Family Welfare Committees

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Section 498A IPC (now Section 85, Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023)**: Introduced in 1983 to protect married women from cruelty by husband or relatives (dowry harassment, mental/physical cruelty).
* **Problem of misuse**: Courts noted increasing instances where the law was used to file false complaints, leading to unnecessary arrests of husbands/relatives.
* **Checks introduced earlier**:

  * *2008 CrPC Amendment*: Arrest only when “necessary”.
  * *Arnesh Kumar vs State of Bihar (2014)*: Checklist for police before arrest; notice for appearance instead of immediate arrest.
  * *Satender Kumar Antil (2022)*: Bail to be granted if arrest violated Arnesh Kumar norms.
* **Judicial Experimentation**:

  * *Rajesh Sharma (2017)*: FWCs + one-month review period before action → widely criticized → rolled back in *Social Action Forum for Manav Adhikar (2018)*.

### 2. **The News**

* In **Shivangi Bansal vs Sahib Bansal (July 22, 2025)**, the Supreme Court endorsed **Allahabad High Court’s 2022 guidelines** (*Mukesh Bansal case*).
* Guidelines:

  * **Two-month cooling period** after FIR/complaint before coercive action.
  * Referral of complaint to a **Family Welfare Committee (FWC)** during this period.
* Critics argue:

  * This undermines a victim’s **right to prompt justice**.
  * Weakens **autonomy of police and magistrates**.
  * Creates quasi-judicial bodies (FWCs) without statutory backing.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Legislative Steps**:

  * Section 498A → Section 85, BNS, with preliminary inquiry before FIR.
  * 2008 CrPC amendment introduced proportionality in arrest.
* **Judicial Safeguards**:

  * *Lalita Kumari (2014)*: Preliminary inquiry allowed in matrimonial cases before FIR.
  * *Arnesh Kumar (2014)* & *Satender Kumar Antil (2022)*: Arrest checks + bail safeguards.
  * *Social Action Forum for Manav Adhikar (2018)*: Struck down earlier FWC directions, upholding prompt access to justice.
* **Policy Context**: NCRB data shows complaints rising, but arrests declining → indicates that safeguards are working without blocking victim rights.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

* **Issues & Challenges**:

  * Judicial overreach—FWCs lack statutory mandate.
  * Delays in justice exacerbate victims’ trauma and discourage reporting.
  * Misuse concerns already addressed via law & precedent → fresh restrictions appear redundant.
  * Federal & gender justice concerns: undermines women’s constitutional right to equality and protection.
* **Impacts**:

  * **Social**: Weakens deterrence against domestic violence.
  * **Legal**: Undermines functional autonomy of police/judiciary.
  * **Ethical**: Prioritizing potential misuse over actual victims’ suffering raises moral dilemmas.
* **UPSC Themes**:

  * GS II: Polity (Separation of powers, role of judiciary).
  * GS II/GS I: Women empowerment, vulnerable sections.
  * GS IV: Ethics of justice vs misuse.

### 5. **Way Forward**

* **Revisit the ruling**: Supreme Court should reconsider in line with *Social Action Forum (2018)* and avoid repeating judicial experiments that harm victims.
* **Strengthen safeguards**:

  * Strict compliance with *Arnesh Kumar* guidelines rather than new committees.
  * Training for police & magistrates to balance protection of accused with victim’s rights.
* **Legislative clarity**: If needed, Parliament should codify timelines and procedures—judiciary should avoid creating parallel quasi-legal bodies.
* **Victim-centric approach**: Fast-track courts, counseling services, and legal aid to support women while ensuring false cases are weeded out through preliminary inquiry.
* **Data-driven monitoring**: Use NCRB data and independent studies to assess misuse vs genuine complaints, rather than relying on anecdotal concerns.

### 2. **The News**

* On **September 17, 2025**, World Patient Safety Day highlighted that safe care remains elusive worldwide.
* In India:

  * Patients face harm from infections, unsafe procedures, delayed diagnoses, and medication errors.
  * Hospitals are instituting protocols, audits, and training, but staff shortages, fatigue, and high workloads weaken safety.
  * A **two-way gap** persists: overburdened providers + passive patients who hesitate to ask questions.
* Civil society, accreditation bodies, and patient advocacy groups are working, but less than **5% of hospitals** in India are fully accredited for safety.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **National Patient Safety Implementation Framework (2018–25)**: Roadmap for embedding safety in clinical programs, adverse event reporting, training, and system strengthening.
* **NABH (National Accreditation Board for Hospitals & Healthcare Providers)**: Raises safety benchmarks on infection control, patient rights, medication safety.
* **Pharmacovigilance Programs**: Society of Pharmacovigilance, India monitors adverse drug reactions.
* **Civil society contributions**:

  * *Patient Safety & Access Initiative*: Advocates medical device regulation clarity.
  * *Patients for Patient Safety Foundation*: Weekly outreach to 14 lakh households; training for 1,100 hospitals and 52,000 professionals.

# At UNHRC, India condemns violation of Qatar’s sovereignty
## India Defends Qatar’s Sovereignty at UNHRC

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC)**: An inter-governmental body within the UN system responsible for promoting and protecting human rights globally.
* **Sovereignty**: A core principle of international law (UN Charter, Article 2(1)) — every state has full authority over its territory and domestic affairs, free from external interference.
* **Background**: On **September 9, 2025**, Israel carried out a bombing in Doha, Qatar. This has drawn global concern about escalation in the Gulf region.
* **India’s Diplomatic Posture**: India has consistently emphasized respect for sovereignty, non-intervention, and peaceful resolution of disputes, particularly in West Asia, where millions of Indian diaspora live and India has critical energy ties.

### 2. **The News**

* On **September 16, 2025**, at a **UNHRC session in Geneva**, India’s Permanent Representative **Arindam Bagchi**:

  * Expressed **deep concern** over Israeli strikes in Doha.
  * **Condemned violation of Qatar’s sovereignty** without naming Israel.
  * Warned that such actions undermine peace and stability regionally and globally.
* PM Modi also spoke to Qatar’s Emir, reaffirming India’s solidarity and call for dialogue over escalation.
* This was India’s **second official statement** after the External Affairs Ministry earlier noted Israel’s strikes and voiced concern.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Diplomatic Outreach**:

  * PM’s direct call with Qatar’s Emir.
  * Statement at UNHRC reinforcing India’s position.
* **Policy Framework**:

  * India’s traditional foreign policy pillars in West Asia: **sovereignty, stability, strategic neutrality, diaspora safety, and energy security**.
  * India balances relations with **Israel (defense, tech ties)** and **Qatar (energy, diaspora, investments)**.
* **Relevant Precedents**:

  * India has similarly condemned sovereignty violations in Ukraine (Russia) and called for peace in Gaza.
  * Non-alignment and “multi-alignment” remain India’s guiding diplomatic tools.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

* **Issues & Challenges**:

  * Balancing ties with **Israel vs Gulf states** (especially Qatar, which hosts 8 lakh Indians and supplies LNG).
  * Avoiding escalation that could threaten **energy flows, diaspora security, remittances**.
  * Upholding principles of sovereignty consistently — selective application risks credibility.
* **Impacts**:

  * **Geopolitical**: Strengthens India-Qatar relations; signals to Israel India’s discomfort with overreach.
  * **Economic**: Safeguards energy supplies, LNG imports, and expatriate interests.
  * **Strategic**: Reinforces India’s image as a responsible power committed to dialogue and diplomacy.
* **Ethical Dimensions**:

  * Moral consistency in condemning violations of sovereignty globally.
  * Responsibility towards peace in regions where Indian lives and livelihoods are directly at stake.

# Unseen labour, exploitation: the hidden human cost of Artificial Intelligence
## Unseen Labour and Exploitation in Artificial Intelligence (AI)

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: Systems that simulate human intelligence, performing tasks such as image recognition, language processing, decision-making, and pattern detection.
* **Data & Labour**: AI systems rely on massive amounts of **labeled data** for training. Behind the “intelligence” are often thousands of **low-paid human workers** who annotate images, transcribe audio, filter harmful content, or train chatbots.
* **Global Supply Chains of AI**:

  * Work is outsourced to countries in the Global South (Kenya, Philippines, India).
  * Jobs include content moderation, labeling self-driving car data, refining large language models, etc.
* **Hidden Cost**: While AI creates profits for big tech, the labour enabling it is invisible, precarious, and often exploitative.

### 2. **The News**

* Recent reports and academic studies have highlighted the **“hidden human cost” of AI**:

  * Workers moderating violent, pornographic, or hate content face **psychological trauma**.
  * Low wages — sometimes **\$1–\$2 per hour**.
  * Lack of recognition or labour rights, since their work is outsourced via platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk, Sama, or Appen.
* This exploitation remains **largely unseen by end-users**, who interact with seemingly “autonomous” AI tools.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **India**:

  * NITI Aayog’s *National Strategy for AI* emphasizes ethical and inclusive AI but lacks detailed labour protection frameworks for gig/AI workers.
  * Labour Codes (2020) cover gig workers in principle but enforcement remains weak.
* **Global**:

  * *EU AI Act (2024)*: Requires transparency about human involvement in AI systems.
  * *OECD AI Principles*: Promote human-centric and fair AI development.
  * *UNESCO’s AI Ethics Recommendations*: Stress dignity, fairness, and worker protection.
* **Civil Society & Unions**: Advocacy groups are pushing for **AI supply chain transparency**, labour rights for digital workers, and psychological support for content moderators.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

* **Issues & Challenges**:

  * **Labour rights**: Invisible workers lack minimum wage, health protections, or recognition.
  * **Mental health**: Exposure to disturbing content leads to trauma and burnout.
  * **Inequality**: AI wealth concentrated in tech firms; labour outsourced to vulnerable workers in low-income countries.
  * **Governance gap**: No international framework specifically regulating “AI labour”.
* **Impacts**:

  * **Social**: Creates new forms of digital exploitation akin to “21st-century sweatshops.”
  * **Economic**: Disproportionate profit-sharing — corporations benefit, workers stay impoverished.
  * **Ethical**: Raises concerns of **justice, dignity, and invisibility of labour** in the digital economy.
  * **Polity/Global Relations**: AI supply chains reflect **neo-colonial patterns**—data and profit flow North, labour burden falls South.
* **UPSC Themes**: GS II (Labour rights, global governance), GS III (AI, technology and society), GS IV (ethics of invisibility, justice, human dignity).

### 5. **Way Forward**

* **Transparency & Recognition**:

  * Mandate disclosure of human involvement in AI development.
  * Credit labour contributions in AI supply chains.
* **Labour Standards**:

  * Minimum wage, health insurance, and mental health support for AI gig workers.
  * International guidelines on digital labour, akin to ILO standards.
* **Corporate Responsibility**:

  * Big Tech firms must share profits more equitably and invest in worker welfare.
  * Establish ethical outsourcing policies (fair contracts, audits).
* **Policy in India**:

  * Strengthen labour codes to explicitly include **AI data workers**.
  * Set up grievance redressal mechanisms for gig/digital labourers.
* **Global Cooperation**:

  * Push through UN/ILO for a **Global Charter on AI Labour Rights**.
  * Encourage collaboration on ethical AI supply chains, similar to sustainability norms in trade.
