# Modi calls for harmony in ethnic strife-torn Manipur
## PM Modi’s Visit to Manipur Amid Ethnic Violence

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Ethnic conflict in Manipur (since May 2023):**

  * **Communities involved:**

    * **Meitei**: Predominantly in the **Imphal valley**, majority population, demand ST status.
    * **Kuki-Zo**: Predominantly in the **hill districts**, oppose Meitei ST demand, face land insecurity.
  * **Causes:** Ethnic tensions, land rights, demographic anxieties, insurgency history, and governance failures.
  * **Impact:** Large-scale violence, killings, displacement of thousands, destruction of homes and churches/temples.
* **Geographical fault line:** Valley–Hill divide (only \~10% of land is valley, inhabited by Meiteis; \~90% is hill, protected by special land rights for tribals).
* **Displacement issue:** Internally displaced persons (IDPs) continue to live in camps, with deep mistrust between communities.

### 2. **The News**

* On **Saturday, September 2025**, **PM Narendra Modi** made his **first visit to Manipur** since violence erupted.
* **Visits & Announcements:**

  * Flew from **Aizawl (Mizoram)** to **Imphal**.
  * Went by road to **Churachandpur** (hill district), met internally displaced people.
  * Inaugurated development projects worth **₹7,300 crore** in the hills.
  * Returned to **Imphal city**, addressed gathering at **Kangla Fort**, inaugurated projects worth **₹1,200 crore**.
* **Message:** Called for **strengthening dialogue** and building a **bridge of harmony between hill and valley communities**.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Security Measures:** Central forces deployed since 2023; curfews, internet suspensions imposed intermittently.
* **Relief & Rehabilitation:** State and Centre running relief camps for IDPs.
* **Development Push:** Announcements of infrastructure projects (railways in Mizoram, ₹7,300 crore projects in Churachandpur, ₹1,200 crore projects in Imphal).
* **Dialogue Efforts:** Sporadic peace talks attempted but lack of sustained reconciliation framework.
* **Constitutional Safeguards:**

  * **Sixth Schedule provisions** for hill areas (autonomous district councils).
  * **Article 371C** for Manipur: special arrangements for administration of hill areas.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

**Issues & Challenges:**

* **Ethnic Polarisation:** Deep mistrust between Meiteis and Kuki-Zo, risk of permanent segregation.
* **Governance Deficit:** Delayed political response, perceived bias, weak reconciliation structures.
* **Security vs. Dialogue:** Heavy security presence without political trust-building.
* **Humanitarian Crisis:** IDPs living in camps for over two years.
* **Democratic Participation:** Violence linked to elections and representation.

**Impacts:**

* **Societal:** Worsening inter-community relations, trauma among displaced families.
* **Economic:** Disruption of trade, agriculture, and investment in the North-East.
* **Polity:** Strains Centre–State relations; questions federal handling of internal conflicts.
* **Strategic:** North-East is a gateway to India’s **Act East Policy**; instability undermines connectivity projects and India’s regional influence.

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Inclusive Dialogue:** Establish neutral platforms with representation from Meitei, Kuki-Zo, Nagas, and civil society to rebuild trust.
2. **Truth & Reconciliation Commission:** Document grievances, investigate violence, and recommend institutional safeguards.
3. **Rehabilitation & Resettlement:** Ensure dignified return or permanent resettlement of IDPs with housing, jobs, and security.
4. **Strengthen Local Governance:** Empower Autonomous District Councils; review land and ST policies in a consultative manner.
5. **Balanced Security Approach:** Combine security presence with confidence-building measures.
6. **Development as Healing:** Prioritise inclusive projects in both valley and hills to prevent perceptions of bias.
7. **Act East Integration:** Link peace in Manipur with broader economic opportunities in the North-East, highlighting benefits for all communities.

# About 60% of India’s outward FDI goes to ‘tax havens’
## Outward FDI and Tax Havens: India’s Strategic Use of Low-Tax Jurisdictions

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Outward FDI**: Investment made by Indian companies into businesses/entities abroad.
* **Tax Havens / Low-Tax Jurisdictions**: Countries with very low or no taxes, simple regulatory frameworks, and flexible investment rules (e.g., Singapore, Mauritius, UAE, Switzerland).
* **Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)**: A legal entity created in a low-tax jurisdiction to route investments into a third country.
* **First-Level Investment**: RBI records only the immediate destination (e.g., Singapore), not the *final* destination (e.g., U.S. or Europe).
* **Global Concern**: “Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS)” by multinational corporations, leading to global initiatives like OECD’s **Pillar Two** (minimum 15% corporate tax rule).

### 2. **The News**

* **RBI data (2024–25):**

  * Out of total outward FDI of **₹3,488.5 crore**, **56% (₹1,946 crore)** went to low-tax jurisdictions.
  * Top 3 destinations: **Singapore (22.6%)**, **Mauritius (10.9%)**, **UAE (9.1%)** — together >40%.
* **Q1 of 2025–26:** Share of low-tax jurisdictions rose to **63%**.
* **Motives beyond tax:**

  * Easier fund raising, investor confidence.
  * Protection for Indian parent companies.
  * Flexibility in capital movement.
  * Attracting strategic foreign partners wary of India’s regulatory/tax complexities.
* **U.S. Tariffs Impact:** If sustained, could push Indian firms to relocate value-addition activities abroad to escape import tariffs on India.
* **Joint Ventures:** Nearly 60% of Indian investments routed through tax havens in July 2025 were for JVs.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Double Tax Avoidance Agreements (DTAA):** India has re-negotiated treaties with Mauritius, Singapore, Cyprus to curb “treaty shopping.”
* **General Anti-Avoidance Rules (GAAR, 2017):** Allows authorities to deny tax benefits if transactions lack commercial substance.
* **OECD BEPS Framework:** India participates in global minimum corporate tax push (15%).
* **RBI Regulations:** Requires reporting of outward FDI, tracks “first-level” investment destinations.
* **SEBI & FEMA Rules:** Regulate fund flows, overseas direct investments, and external commercial borrowings.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

**Issues & Challenges:**

* **Revenue loss:** Profit shifting reduces India’s tax base.
* **Transparency gap:** RBI data hides the “ultimate destination” of investments.
* **Dependence on tax havens:** Raises questions of regulatory arbitrage.
* **Global credibility:** May draw criticism that India tolerates round-tripping.
* **Tariffs & geopolitics:** U.S. tariff regime could encourage corporate migration.

**Impacts:**

* **Positive:**

  * Access to global investors.
  * Strategic flexibility in acquisitions and joint ventures.
  * Protection for Indian firms from regulatory risks.
* **Negative:**

  * Tax avoidance risk.
  * Outward investment could reduce domestic capital availability.
  * Weakens India’s leverage in global negotiations on fair tax systems.

**Ethical/Governance Dimensions:**

* Balancing legitimate business needs vs. preventing abuse of tax havens.
* Upholding equity — small domestic firms pay full taxes, while large firms exploit loopholes.

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Improve Domestic Business Climate**: Simplify taxation, reduce compliance costs, and ease FDI rules to make India itself attractive for global JVs.
2. **Ultimate Beneficiary Tracking**: RBI should publish “final destination” data, not just first-level routing.
3. **Global Coordination**: Work with OECD on enforcing global minimum tax to reduce arbitrage.
4. **Targeted Tax Treaties**: Ensure revised DTAAs prevent round-tripping while retaining investor appeal.
5. **Tariff Diplomacy**: Proactively negotiate with U.S. and other partners to prevent tariff-induced capital flight.
6. **Support Domestic Investors**: Encourage Indian startups and corporates to raise capital through domestic exchanges and new GIFT City structures (International Financial Services Centres).
7. **Balanced Regulation**: Allow genuine SPVs for strategic investments but tighten monitoring to detect shell entities used solely for tax avoidance.

# ‘Patient perceptions drive frivolous antibiotic use in India’
## Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) & India’s Prescription Problem

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR):** When bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites evolve to resist drugs, making infections harder to treat.

* **Global Threat:** Causes \~5 million deaths annually; projected to rise if unchecked.

* **Drivers:** Overuse and misuse of antibiotics, poor infection control, lack of new drug development.

* **India’s Case:**

  * > 500 million antibiotic prescriptions annually (private sector alone).
  * Example: **Childhood diarrhoea** (mostly viral, treatable with ORS + zinc) → \~70% still treated with antibiotics.

* **Knowledge vs Know-Do Gap:**

  * *Knowledge gap* → Providers don’t know correct practice.
  * *Know-do gap* → Providers know but don’t follow, due to other pressures.

### 2. **The News**

* A **Science Advances study** (2025) by researchers from **IIM-Bangalore and NEERMAN (New Delhi)** examined 2,282 private providers in Karnataka & Bihar.
* **Findings:**

  * 50% lacked knowledge.
  * Among those who knew antibiotics weren’t needed, **62% still prescribed them**.
  * Closing *knowledge gap* → reduces misuse by only 6%.
  * Closing *know-do gap* → reduces misuse by \~30%.
* **Drivers:**

  * Providers wrongly assume patients demand antibiotics.
  * Patients actually valued trust, kindness, and quality of care over antibiotics.
  * Financial incentives and drug supply less important.
* **Vulnerable group:** Less-trained providers (pharmacists, rural medical practitioners) had widest know-do gaps.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **National Action Plan on AMR (2017–2021, extended):** Framework for surveillance, regulation, and awareness.
* **Schedule H1 Drugs:** Restricts over-the-counter sale of antibiotics; requires prescription.
* **AMR Surveillance Network (ICMR):** Monitors resistance trends in hospitals.
* **National Health Policy 2017:** Recognises AMR as a priority.
* **Red Line Campaign:** Antibiotics marked with a red line to discourage misuse.
* **Global Context:** India part of WHO’s Global Action Plan on AMR.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

**Issues & Challenges:**

* Overprescription despite knowledge → know-do gap is structural.
* Lack of patient education fuels provider misperceptions.
* Weak enforcement of Schedule H1 → easy OTC sales.
* Rural areas dependent on untrained practitioners.
* Global risk: India’s high antibiotic consumption accelerates resistant strains, affecting international health.

**Impacts:**

* **Health:** Rise of drug-resistant infections (e.g., TB, typhoid, pneumonia).
* **Economic:** Higher treatment costs, prolonged hospital stays, GDP loss.
* **Ethical:** Patient vulnerability exploited due to misinformation or provider insecurity.
* **Governance:** Weak regulation + insufficient monitoring creates systemic loopholes.

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Target the Know-Do Gap:** Behavioural interventions (nudges, peer accountability, public reporting of prescribing practices).
2. **Patient-Centric Campaigns:** Awareness drives showing antibiotics are not always necessary; empower patients to demand rational care.
3. **Provider Incentives:** Recognise and reward correct practices (quality-based reimbursements, accreditation).
4. **Expand Training:** Focus on pharmacists and rural practitioners with short modules on rational drug use.
5. **Strengthen Regulation:** Enforce Schedule H1 compliance with digital prescription monitoring.
6. **Community Engagement:** Promote trust-building, continuity of care, and better communication between doctors and patients.
7. **Surveillance + Research:** Expand ICMR’s AMR monitoring network; invest in real-world behavioural studies.

* **Scale of the Problem**: Over **1 billion people globally** live with mental health conditions (WHO).
* **Impact**:

  * Second leading cause of long-term disability.
  * Huge **economic cost** – depression & anxiety alone cost \~\$1 trillion annually.
  * **Suicide** – \~7.27 lakh deaths in 2021; a leading cause of death among youth.
* **UN SDG Target**: Reduce suicide mortality by one-third by 2030 → current trajectory only \~12% reduction, falling short.

### 2. **The News**

* WHO published two reports: **World Mental Health Today** & **Mental Health Atlas 2024**.
* **Key findings:**

  * **Women disproportionately affected** by anxiety and depression.
  * **Investment Stagnation** – median government spending stuck at 2% of health budgets since 2017.
  * **Inequities** – high-income countries spend \$65/person vs low-income \$0.04/person.
  * **Manpower Shortage** – global median: 13 mental health workers per 100,000 people.
  * **Treatment Gaps** – <10% of affected in low-income countries receive care.
  * **Service Models** – <10% of countries fully shifted to community-based care; reliance still on psychiatric hospitals with long involuntary admissions.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

**Global:**

* WHO’s **Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 2013–2030**.
* Push for community-based models, integration into primary care, and rights-based legislation.

**India:**

* **Mental Healthcare Act, 2017**: Declares mental healthcare a **right**; prohibits inhuman treatment.
* **National Mental Health Programme (NMHP, 1982)** & **District Mental Health Programme**.
* **Tele-MANAS (National Tele-Mental Health Programme, 2022)**: Expanding tele-counselling.
* **Manodarpan (2020, MoE)**: Support for students.
* **Budgetary Allocation**: \~₹1,004 crore (FY 2025–26), stagnant in recent years.
* **Workforce Status**: 0.7 psychiatrists per 100,000 people (vs WHO norm of 3).
* **Awareness Campaigns**: Targeting stigma reduction, education, community outreach.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

**Issues & Challenges:**

* **Underfunding**: Just 2% of health budgets globally, \~1,000 crore in India.
* **Workforce Shortage**: Huge gap in psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers.
* **Stigma & Reluctance**: Prevents early help-seeking.
* **Institutional Bias**: Reliance on psychiatric hospitals; slow transition to community-based care.
* **Inequity**: Urban-rural divide; low-income vs high-income countries.

**Impacts:**

* **Public Health**: Rising suicides, untreated conditions worsening chronic diseases.
* **Economic**: Productivity loss, treatment costs.
* **Social**: Family burden, intergenerational trauma, school dropouts.
* **Ethical**: Denial of dignity, autonomy, and access to care → violation of rights.

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Higher Investment**: Increase allocations to at least 5–10% of health budgets, with focus on community-based models.
2. **Workforce Expansion**: Train more psychiatrists, psychologists, psychiatric nurses; incentivise rural postings.
3. **Community Integration**: Strengthen district-level programmes, primary healthcare integration.
4. **Digital & Telehealth**: Scale up Tele-MANAS, AI-driven counselling support, mobile apps for early intervention.
5. **Legislation & Rights**: Ensure implementation of Mental Healthcare Act, 2017; regular audits of compliance.
6. **Suicide Prevention Strategy**: Expand helplines, school-based mental health programmes, and targeted interventions for youth.

# How has Gen Z forced changes in Nepal?
## Nepal’s Gen Z Uprising, 2025

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Background**: Nepal adopted its progressive Constitution in 2015, establishing a *federal democratic republic*. However, politics since then has been dominated by three leaders — K.P. Sharma Oli (CPN-UML), Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda” (CPN-MC), and Sher Bahadur Deuba (Nepali Congress) — through unstable alliances.
* **Trigger of 2025 Crisis**: On **September 4, 2025**, the Oli-led CPN-UML government banned 26 social media platforms citing non-compliance with registration rules.
* **Underlying Issues**: Corruption, economic stagnation, youth unemployment, mass migration, and disillusionment with the political class.
* **Gen Z Role**: The protests were organised by young people, largely through social media tools (Instagram, Discord). Unlike past movements (1990, 2006), this one had no backing from traditional political parties.

### 2. **The News**

* **Protests**: Began September 8 in Kathmandu, escalated into violent clashes.

  * **Casualties**: 34 killed, 1,000+ injured.
  * Government buildings (Parliament, PMO, SC, Kantipur Media House) and politicians’ homes were attacked.
  * Jails stormed, ex-minister **Rabi Lamichhane** (RSP) freed.
* **Political Fallout**:

  * PM Oli resigned on September 9.
  * After Army-mediated talks, ex-Chief Justice **Sushila Karki** appointed interim PM under Article 61.
  * She recommended **dissolution of Parliament**, sparking constitutional debate.
* **Monarchist Factor**: While not proven, suspicion exists that royalist forces infiltrated the protests, recalling earlier pro-monarchy violence in March 2025.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Interim Government Formation**:

  * Mediated by President Poudel and Army Chief Gen. Ashokraj Sigdel.
  * Supported by Gen Z leaders and NGOs like *Hami Nepal*.
* **Mandate**: Conduct fresh elections by **March 2026**.
* **Constitutional Provisions**:

  * **Article 76(7)**: Parliament dissolution permitted only after failed attempts to form govt.
  * **Article 66(2)**: Presidential acts require Council of Ministers’ recommendation.
  * The interim PM’s dissolution recommendation, therefore, may not have constitutional backing.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

**Issues & Challenges:**

* **Constitutional Crisis**: Parliament dissolution outside prescribed procedures.
* **Democratic Legitimacy**: Gen Z movement bypassed institutions → risk of extra-constitutional precedent.
* **Federalism Unresolved**: Disputes over provincial demarcation and power-sharing.
* **Political Instability**: “Musical chairs” among three major leaders; weak governance.
* **Risk of Democratic Regression**: If monarchists or authoritarian forces exploit the vacuum.

**Impacts:**

* **Political**: Traditional elites discredited; possibility for new forces to rise.
* **Social**: Generational shift — Gen Z asserting leadership in democratic processes.
* **Security**: Violence undermines state authority; risk of Army overreach.
* **Regional**: Nepal’s instability affects India, China, and wider Himalayan geopolitics.

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Restore Constitutional Order**: Supreme Court review of dissolution; reinforce due process.
2. **Inclusive Dialogue**: Engage Gen Z activists, traditional parties, and civil society in election roadmap.
3. **Credible Elections**: Ensure free, fair polls by March 2026; Election Commission to be strengthened.
4. **Political Renewal**: Encourage entry of non-traditional leaders, independent movements, and youth-driven parties.
5. **Federalism Consolidation**: Resolve boundary/resource disputes to strengthen provincial governance.
6. **Socio-Economic Focus**: Job creation, anti-corruption measures, curbing migration outflow.
7. **Guard Democracy**: Prevent monarchy or authoritarian actors from hijacking Gen Z’s democratic aspirations.

# What are Foreigners Tribunals’ new powers?
## Immigration and Foreigners Act, 2025

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Earlier Laws Repealed**:

  * Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920
  * Registration of Foreigners Act, 1939
  * Foreigners Act, 1946
  * Immigration (Carriers’ Liability) Act, 2000
* **Why Replaced?** Old, pre-Independence laws led to multiplicity and overlap; did not reflect current realities of migration, border management, and security.
* **Scope of New Act**: Regulates entry, stay, registration, visa, deportation, and monitoring of foreigners in India. Introduces biometric systems, codifies BOI’s role, strengthens tribunal mechanisms, and updates exemption rules.

### 2. **The News**

* On **September 2025**, the **MHA notified Rules, Orders, and Exemption Order** to operationalise the *Immigration and Foreigners Act, 2025*.
* **Key Developments**:

  * Bureau of Immigration (BOI) given statutory authority.
  * Biometric collection of all foreigners mandated.
  * Foreigners Tribunals given powers of first-class magistrates.
  * Border forces legally empowered to record data and push back illegal entrants.
  * Specific exemptions created for select communities (Nepalese, Bhutanese, Tibetans, Sri Lankan Tamils till 2015, six minority communities from Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh).

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

**Rules:**

* **Bureau of Immigration (BOI)** now legally empowered: fraud detection, deportation, movement restrictions, central immigration database.
* **Educational institutions** must report all foreign students, including attendance & conduct.
* **Premises restrictions**: Illegal migrants now explicitly added to categories of foreigners barred from frequenting resorts, clubs, entertainment places.
* **Immigration Officers** designated from the Intelligence Bureau.

**Order:**

* **Foreigners Tribunals (FTs):**

  * Extended powers → can issue arrest warrants, detain foreigners.
  * Members capped at 3 per tribunal.
  * Review mechanism → ex-parte orders can be set aside if appealed within 30 days.
  * While FTs remain Assam-specific, other states continue to use local courts.
* **Border Guarding Forces** (BSF, Assam Rifles, Coast Guard) legally empowered to intercept illegal migrants, collect biometric/demographic data, and push them back.

**Exemption Order:**

* **Full exemptions** for Nepalese, Bhutanese, Tibetans (traditional policy).
* **Conditional exemptions**:

  * Sri Lankan Tamil refugees (till Jan 9, 2015) → exempt from passport/visa provisions but not eligible for LTV/citizenship.
  * Six minority communities from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Pakistan → exempt from penal provisions if entered before Dec 31, 2024, eligible for LTVs (precursor to citizenship under CAA, 2019 framework).

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

**Issues & Challenges:**

* **Human Rights vs. Security**: Biometric data, detention powers, and deportation mechanisms could lead to rights violations if not monitored.
* **Constitutional Questions**: Extension of tribunal powers (FTs) to judicial magistrate level raises debate over separation of powers and due process.
* **Assam NRC Legacy**: 19 lakh excluded remain in limbo; FTs central to their fate.
* **Federalism**: Migration/border control is Union subject, but state governments (esp. in border regions) face social, political consequences.
* **Exemptions**: While humanitarian, differential treatment of groups (e.g., Sri Lankan Tamils excluded from LTV, but Afghan/Bangladeshi/Pakistani minorities included) may be questioned for parity.

**Impacts:**

* **Positive**: Modernised framework; BOI statutory role improves coordination; biometric system strengthens tracking; clarity in exemptions offers humanitarian relief.
* **Negative**: Risk of arbitrary actions by immigration officers; student monitoring may discourage foreign enrolment; tribunals could become overburdened or politicised.

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Safeguards in Tribunals**: Ensure fair trials, independent review, legal aid to vulnerable persons.
2. **Human Rights Protections**: Balance deportation/detention powers with oversight mechanisms.
3. **Transparency in BOI**: Publish annual reports on immigration fraud, deportations, exemptions.
4. **Streamline Exemption Policy**: Clarify rationale for differential treatment (e.g., Sri Lankan Tamils vs. other minorities).
5. **Technology Integration**: Use AI-driven immigration databases but with strong data privacy laws.
6. **International Engagement**: Coordinate with neighbours (Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka) on deportation/repatriation frameworks.
7. **Long-term Policy Coherence**: Align exemptions with **Citizenship Act/CAA rules**, refugee policy, and India’s international obligations.
