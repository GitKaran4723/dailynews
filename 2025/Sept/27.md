# Trump slaps tariffs on drugs, trucks, furniture
## U.S. Tariffs on Drugs, Trucks, and Furniture

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Tariffs**: A tax imposed by a government on imported goods. It makes imports costlier, with the goal of protecting domestic industries or raising revenue.
* **100% tariff**: Doubling the price of the product in the U.S. market, effectively discouraging imports.
* **Pharmaceuticals**: Branded drugs are often high-value imports. U.S. patients rely heavily on global supply chains for medicines.
* **Heavy-duty trucks & furniture**: Large sectors where imports compete strongly with U.S. manufacturers.
* **Legal context**: Trump’s earlier tariffs (2018–2020) faced legal challenges. This round leans on firmer statutory grounds to withstand scrutiny, especially with a Supreme Court case pending.

### 2. **The News**

* On **Thursday**, U.S. President **Donald Trump** announced **new tariffs**:

  * **100% duties on branded pharmaceutical imports** (effective Oct 1, unless firms start U.S. manufacturing).
  * **25% tariff on heavy-duty trucks**.
  * **50% on kitchen cabinets & bathroom vanities**.
  * **30% on upholstered furniture**.
* Announced on **Truth Social**.
* Justification: Prevent “flooding” of cheap imports into U.S. markets.
* **Uncertainty**: No clarity yet on exemptions for allies (EU, Japan).
* **Industry response**: Pharma lobby (PhRMA) warned tariffs could derail billions in U.S. investment plans.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Historical context**:

  * **Smoot-Hawley Tariffs (1930s)** – infamous for worsening global depression.
  * **Trump’s first term (2017–2021)** – aggressive tariffs on steel, aluminum, China goods under Section 232 & 301.
* **Legal provisions**:

  * *Section 232 (national security)* and *Section 301 (unfair trade practices)* of U.S. law often used.
* **Biden-era trade policy**: More measured, continued some Trump tariffs on China.
* **Healthcare policies**: Previous governments encouraged domestic drug manufacturing (esp. post-COVID-19) through incentives, not tariffs.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

* **Economic impacts**:

  * Higher costs for U.S. consumers → inflationary pressure.
  * Supply chain disruption, esp. in medicines (public health concern).
  * May push foreign companies to set up plants in U.S. (reshoring).
* **Trade relations**:

  * Could provoke retaliation from EU, Japan, China, etc.
  * Adds uncertainty to WTO-based trade order.
* **Polity & Governance**:

  * Tariffs reflect executive dominance in U.S. trade policy.
  * Raises debates on balancing protectionism vs. globalization.
* **Ethical issues**:

  * Access to affordable medicines at stake.
  * Protecting domestic jobs vs. global cooperation in healthcare.

### 5. **Way Forward**

* **For the U.S. government**:

  * Clarify exemptions for allies to avoid trade wars.
  * Consider alternative incentives (subsidies, tax credits) instead of punitive tariffs for domestic manufacturing.
  * Ensure drug affordability through separate health policy mechanisms.
* **For industries**:

  * Diversify supply chains; invest in U.S. production capacity.
  * Engage in negotiations to secure exemptions.
* **For global trade order**:

  * Need WTO reform and bilateral negotiations to handle tariff disputes.
  * Promote cooperative frameworks in pharmaceuticals (given global health needs).

# Upgrading shipyards
## India’s New ₹69,725 Crore Shipbuilding Package

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Shipbuilding**: The process of designing and constructing ships, including merchant vessels, defence ships, and special-purpose vessels.
* **Gross tonnage (GT)**: A measure of a ship’s overall internal volume. Higher GT means larger ships.
* **Shipyards**: Facilities where ships are constructed and repaired. Efficient shipyards use **modular construction** (prefabricated blocks) and advanced cranes for faster production.
* **Global context**:

  * **China, South Korea, Japan** dominate world shipbuilding with advanced technology and economies of scale.
  * India’s shipbuilding industry remains small, slow, and costly → making Indian shipowners reluctant to place domestic orders.

### 2. **The News**

* Government announced a **₹69,725 crore package** to **revitalise India’s shipbuilding sector**, replacing the **2015 package** (expiring in March 2026).
* **Targets**:

  * Expand capacity to **4.5 million GT**.
  * Upgrade shipyards with **cutting-edge technology** and **management reforms**.
  * Create **shipbuilding clusters** for ancillaries (engines, electronics, fittings).
  * Provide **financing support** to shipowners for newbuilds.
* **Current challenges**:

  * Only ~6 small merchant ships built in last decade.
  * Long construction timelines (2–3 years vs. global 1 year).
  * Lack of modern infrastructure (large cranes, modular assembly).
  * Poor ancillary ecosystem and absence of long-term demand visibility.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Past schemes**:

  * **2015 Shipbuilding Financial Assistance Policy** (20% subsidy on contracts) – limited success due to delays and high costs.
  * **Infrastructure status** to shipbuilding → cheaper financing, but only for large vessels.
* **Current move (2025)**:

  * Focus on **capacity building** (yard modernization, prefab tech).
  * Promoting **ancillary clusters** (similar to auto-component clusters).
  * Encouraging **green shipping** aligned with India’s **National Green Hydrogen Mission**.
* **Related initiatives**:

  * **Sagarmala Project** (port-led development).
  * **Maritime India Vision 2030** → aims to make India a global maritime hub.
  * **Indian Navy indigenisation policy** → boosts defence shipbuilding.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

* **Economic significance**:

  * Shipbuilding is capital-intensive but generates huge multiplier effects (steel, electronics, jobs).
  * Can reduce India’s dependence on foreign-built ships for trade.
* **Strategic importance**:

  * Maritime security requires a robust domestic shipbuilding base.
  * Reduces vulnerability in times of global supply chain disruptions.
* **Challenges**:

  * Infrastructure gaps (yards, cranes, dry docks).
  * Cost & time overruns deter private investment.
  * Lack of skilled manpower and R&D institutions.
  * Weak demand pull → Indian shipowners prefer foreign newbuilds.
* **Environmental aspect**:

  * Opportunity to integrate with **green shipping** (LNG, hydrogen, ammonia-fuelled ships).
  * Can align with India’s net-zero targets.
* **Governance issues**:

  * Past subsidies failed due to poor monitoring.

# ‘GST Council did not discuss compensation for States’
## GST Council, State Revenues, and Compensation Debate

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Goods and Services Tax (GST)**: Introduced in **2017**, it subsumed most indirect taxes into a single tax system with **dual structure**:

  * **CGST** (Central GST) + **SGST** (State GST) on intra-state supplies.
  * **IGST** (Integrated GST) on inter-state supplies.
* **Revenue implications for States**:

  * States surrendered many of their independent taxation powers (like VAT, entry tax, luxury tax).
  * The **Centre collects GST and then distributes** shares to States.
* **Compensation promise**:

  * Under the **GST (Compensation to States) Act, 2017**, States were promised **14% annual growth** in tax revenues for 5 years (2017–2022).
  * Shortfalls were to be met via a **GST Compensation Cess** (on luxury/sin goods).
* **Cesses & surcharges**: Levied by Centre, not shareable with States. This reduces the “divisible pool” for Finance Commission transfers.

### 2. **The News**

* **Event**: At *The Hindu Mind* forum, Telangana Deputy CM (Finance) **B.V. Mallu** and Kerala Finance Minister **K.N. Balagopal** raised concerns.
* **Main issues highlighted**:

  * GST Council did not discuss **compensation for States’ revenue losses** from recent GST rate cuts.
  * **Revenue imbalance**:

    * ~64% of government expenditure is borne by States, but ~63–64% of revenue accrues to the Centre.
    * Of Centre’s revenue, ~20% is from cesses not shared → only ~30–32% of Central taxes are actually devolved.
  * **Broken promises**: Centre had assured 14% revenue growth, but actual has been ~7–8%.
  * **Lack of transparency**: GST rate rationalisation decisions came without detailed committee reports, unlike earlier practice.
  * **Projected losses**: Kerala alone estimates a loss of ₹8,000–10,000 crore; other States also foresee large hits.
* **Political angle**: Eight States (including Kerala and Telangana) met before the GST Council session to demand compensation, but their concerns weren’t taken up.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **GST Compensation Act, 2017**: Legal framework for compensating States (valid till June 2022, later partial extensions).
* **Finance Commission**:

  * 14th FC: Raised States’ share of divisible pool to 42%.
  * 15th FC: Reduced to 41% (due to J&K reorganisation), but cess/surcharge revenue kept outside the pool.
* **Borrowing mechanisms**: During COVID-19 (2020), Centre borrowed and released funds to States to meet shortfalls.
* **Recent moves**: GST rate rationalisation undertaken, but **compensation extension not assured** beyond earlier deadlines.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

* **Federalism**:

  * GST has tilted fiscal power towards the Centre, weakening **fiscal autonomy of States**.
  * Centre’s increasing use of **cesses** undermines cooperative federalism.
* **Economic governance**:

  * States handle welfare, healthcare, infrastructure → need stable revenue streams.
  * Revenue shocks from GST rate cuts affect States’ ability to fund development.
* **Transparency & accountability**:

  * Non-sharing of data, lack of committee reports → raises questions of trust in GST Council decision-making.
* **Political economy**:

  * Tensions in fiscal federalism can spill into political disputes, undermining GST’s credibility.
* **Ethics & equity**:

  * Principle of fairness breached if States are forced to bear expenditure without commensurate revenue.

### 5. **Way Forward**

* **Policy reforms**:

  * Revisit **GST Compensation Mechanism** → either extend it or design a new predictable formula.
  * Rationalise **cesses/surcharges**; bring more into divisible pool for fairer devolution.
* **Institutional strengthening**:

  * GST Council to ensure **evidence-based decision-making** (committee reports, impact assessments).
  * Strengthen role of **Inter-State Council/Finance Commission** in Centre–State fiscal dialogue.
* **Revenue reforms for States**:

  * Explore **new tax bases** (urban property tax, green levies, digital economy taxation).
  * Strengthen compliance and IT systems to improve GST collections.
* **Long-term restructuring**:

  * Consider moving towards **minimum guaranteed revenue-sharing formula** for States.
  * Build consensus around **rate rationalisation roadmap** to reduce uncertainty.
