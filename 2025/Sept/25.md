# Leh protest turns deadly; Ministry blames activist
## Ladakh Protest for Statehood & Sixth Schedule Status

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Statehood**: Ladakh is currently a Union Territory (UT) without a legislature (since bifurcation of J\&K in August 2019). People demand full statehood to have greater autonomy and representation.
* **Sixth Schedule**: A constitutional provision (Articles 244 & 275) designed to protect the rights of tribal populations by granting autonomy to regional/district councils. Presently, it applies only to certain North-Eastern states. Ladakh, with \~80% tribal population, wants similar safeguards to preserve land, culture, and jobs.
* **Leh Apex Body (LAB)** & **Kargil Democratic Alliance (KDA)**: Two umbrella groups representing Ladakhi interests; both united on demands for statehood and Sixth Schedule inclusion.
* **Sonam Wangchuk**: A renowned climate activist from Ladakh, leading the agitation through hunger strikes and civil protests.

### 2. **The News**

* On **Wednesday in Leh city, Ladakh**, protests demanding statehood and Sixth Schedule status turned violent.
* Several people were feared dead, many injured, and **around 30 security personnel** hurt.
* Protesters **attacked police, torched the BJP office, and vandalised the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council premises**.
* The **Union Home Ministry** blamed “provocative statements” by Sonam Wangchuk, who had been on a hunger strike since **September 10**, citing references to “Arab Spring” and “Gen Z protests in Nepal”.
* Wangchuk broke his fast and left for his village in an ambulance after the violence escalated.
* The Ministry clarified that talks with LAB and KDA were scheduled for **September 26**, and that Ladakh’s demands were under review by a **high-powered committee**.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Urban Flooding**: A condition where cities get inundated due to inadequate drainage, unplanned construction, poor solid waste management, and outdated infrastructure.
* **Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) Curves**: Tools used in hydrology to predict the probability of rainfall events of varying intensity and duration; critical for urban drainage design.
* **Urban Challenge**: Indian cities often prepare for the monsoon based on outdated calendars and averages, not present-day extreme rainfall patterns.

### 2. **The News**

* Recent monsoon events highlight India’s vulnerability:

  * **Punjab**: All 23 districts affected by floods.
  * **Delhi & Gurugram**: Inundated by intense rainfall.
  * **Uttarakhand & Himachal Pradesh**: Frequent cloudbursts.
  * **Kolkata**: Hit by torrential rains.
  * **Mumbai (May 2025)**: Recorded over 135 mm rainfall in 24 hrs, followed by 161 mm the next day.
* Analysis shows **64% of Indian tehsils have seen an increase in heavy rainfall days**, causing damages of around ₹8,700 crore per flood event.
* Drainage and monsoon preparations continue to rely on old assumptions, leading to repeated waterlogging, traffic disruptions, and property damage.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

# Simultaneous polls committee meets Montek, Panagariya
## Simultaneous Elections Debate in India

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Simultaneous Elections** (also called *“One Nation, One Election”*): A proposal to hold Lok Sabha and State Assembly elections at the same time (instead of staggered over 5 years). Local body elections may or may not be included.
* **Arguments in Favour**:

  * Reduces frequency of elections → lowers administrative costs.
  * Minimises “policy paralysis” due to repeated imposition of Model Code of Conduct (MCC).
  * Ensures stability, better focus on governance, and continuity of policies.
  * May improve quality of public expenditure by reducing populist spending cycles.
* **Arguments Against**:

  * Weakens federalism as states lose flexibility to dissolve assemblies.
  * Constitutional hurdles: requires multiple amendments (Articles 83, 172, 174, 356).
  * Practical challenges: synchronising different tenures, by-elections, and ensuring logistical readiness.
  * No conclusive evidence that it directly boosts economic growth.

### 2. **The News**

* The **Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC)**, chaired by BJP MP **P.P. Chaudhary**, is reviewing the draft legislation on simultaneous elections.
* Three prominent economists appeared before it:

  * **Montek Singh Ahluwalia** (former Deputy Chairman, Planning Commission): Opposed the economic argument; said election expenditure would not change whether polls are held simultaneously or separately. No data links election cycles with GDP growth.
  * **Arvind Panagariya** (Chairman, 16th Finance Commission): Supported the move; argued multiple elections increase revenue expenditure before polls, widen fiscal deficits, and delay reforms.
  * **Surjit S. Bhalla** (Economist): Also supported the proposal.
* Earlier, the **Ram Nath Kovind-led High-Level Committee** claimed that simultaneous elections could lead to a **1.5% GDP increase**.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **High-Level Committee on Simultaneous Elections (2023–24)**: Recommended synchronising elections, with constitutional amendments and enabling legislation.
* **Constitution (129th Amendment) Bill, 2024)** and **Union Territories Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024)**: Introduced to pave way for the proposal.
* **NITI Aayog (2017 Discussion Paper)**: Suggested options for phasing simultaneous elections.
* **Law Commission (2018 draft report)**: Supported the idea but highlighted constitutional, logistical, and political challenges.
* **Election Commission of India**: Has earlier indicated logistical feasibility but massive resource mobilisation would be required.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

* **Issues & Challenges**:

  * *Constitutional*: Synchronisation requires major amendments and consensus of states.
  * *Federalism*: Limits states’ power to dissolve assemblies prematurely.
  * *Economy*: Debate over whether it improves fiscal discipline or not.
  * *Democracy*: Risk of national issues overshadowing local concerns.
  * *Logistics*: Ensuring simultaneous deployment of manpower, security, and EVMs/VVPATs.

* **Impacts**:

  * **Positive**: Better governance focus, fiscal discipline, reduction in MCC disruptions.
  * **Negative**: Curtailment of democratic flexibility, dilution of local issues, strain on institutions.

* **Ethics & Governance**: Balancing *efficiency* in governance vs *pluralism* and *representation* in a federal democracy.

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Incremental Approach**: Start with synchronising Lok Sabha and select State elections (phased alignment).
2. **Consensus-Building**: Wider consultation with states, political parties, and civil society to avoid federal friction.
3. **Strengthening MCC Framework**: Instead of reducing elections, reform MCC to minimise policy paralysis.
4. **Electoral Reforms**: Complement with reforms on campaign financing, transparency, and curbing freebies.
5. **Evidence-Based Policy**: Commission independent studies on the fiscal, social, and governance impact of frequent elections before adopting sweeping reforms.
6. **Logistical Preparedness**: Massive investment in EVMs, VVPATs, manpower, and security before rollout.

# No takers yet for EV localisation scheme
## Duty Concession Scheme for Imported Electric Cars

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Background**: Import duties on cars in India are very high (often above 100%), making imported vehicles extremely expensive.
* **The Scheme**: The Centre announced the **Scheme for Promotion of Manufacturing of Electric Passenger Cars in India (SPMEPCI)** in June 2025. It offered duty concessions on imported EVs *if* manufacturers committed to local production within a stipulated timeframe.
* **Objective**: Primarily aimed at attracting Tesla and other global EV makers to invest in India by offering them an entry route at lower import duties, while nudging them to set up factories in India.
* **Global Trade Angle**: India is negotiating several **Free Trade Agreements (FTAs)** with the U.S. and EU, where tariff concessions may make this scheme less relevant. Example: FTA with the U.K. already reduced import duties on a quota of cars to \~10%.

### 2. **The News**

* **Timeline**: Portal launched on **June 24, 2025**; deadline for applications is **October 21, 2025**.
* **Current Status**: After three months, **no automaker has applied** under the scheme.
* **Reasons for Low Interest**:

  * Automakers are waiting for outcomes of FTAs that might offer better deals.
  * Limited clarity on long-term benefits vs risks of committing to local manufacturing.
  * Tesla, the key target, attended the first stakeholder meeting but has had *no further communication* with the government.
* **Government Position**: Officials say there have been no requests from companies to modify the policy, and no tweaks are planned for now.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **SPMEPCI (2025)**: Duty concession + local manufacturing commitment scheme.
* **FTA Negotiations**: U.K. FTA already reduced duties for limited imports; similar concessions may come with U.S./EU deals.
* **Domestic Push for EVs**:

  * **FAME-II scheme** (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles).
  * **PLI scheme for Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) batteries** to localise battery manufacturing.
  * **GST on EVs** reduced to 5%.
  * **State EV policies** with subsidies, tax waivers, and infrastructure incentives.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

* **Issues & Challenges**:

  * Policy uncertainty: Global FTAs vs domestic schemes → companies prefer to wait.
  * High tariff protection vs need to attract global players → balancing act.
  * Dependence on Tesla as a symbolic anchor investor.
  * Slow EV ecosystem development (charging infra, battery supply chains).
* **Impacts**:

  * **Economy**: Delay in attracting FDI and local EV manufacturing investment.
  * **Industry**: Indian carmakers (Tata, Mahindra) continue leading, but global competition is weak.
  * **Trade**: FTA concessions may bypass the scheme, undermining its intent.
  * **Environment**: Slower EV adoption may delay emissions reduction targets.
* **Ethical/Governance Concerns**: Should India provide “special treatment” for a global giant like Tesla while domestic firms get fewer concessions?

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Policy Coherence**: Align domestic EV schemes with FTA negotiations to avoid duplication or undercutting.
2. **Broad-Based Incentives**: Expand beyond Tesla-centric design → make scheme attractive for all global EV makers (Volkswagen, Hyundai, BYD, etc.).
3. **Ease of Doing Business**: Simplify land acquisition, clearances, and infrastructure support to attract investment.
4. **Strengthen Domestic Ecosystem**: Push for battery localisation, raw material security (lithium, cobalt), and R\&D.
5. **Demand-Side Measures**: Expand charging infra, incentivise consumers, and promote fleet electrification.
6. **Mid-Course Corrections**: If no applicants by October 21, consider tweaking scheme terms (longer localisation timelines, phased duty cuts, or linked incentives).
