# Unlocking innovation with India’s procurement reforms
## Procurement Reforms & R\&D

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Procurement policies**: Rules and processes that governments or institutions follow when buying goods/services, often designed for transparency, efficiency, and fraud prevention.
* **R\&D Procurement Challenge**: Unlike routine goods, research requires customised, high-quality, often imported instruments. Standardised procurement rules (e.g., mandatory use of a single government portal like GeM) can delay or compromise quality.
* **Catalytic Procurement**: A concept where government purchasing power is used not only to buy but also to stimulate innovation in the private sector. Examples include the U.S. **SBIR program** and Germany’s **mission-oriented procurement**.
* **India’s Past Problem**: Mandatory procurement via GeM even for highly specialised equipment under ₹200 crore created delays and forced scientists to use poor-quality products.

### 2. **The News**

* In **June 2025**, the Government of India reformed its **General Financial Rules (GFR)**.
* **Key changes**:

  * Exemptions from GeM for specialised R\&D equipment.
  * Direct purchase limit raised from **₹1 lakh to ₹2 lakh**.
  * **Vice-chancellors and directors** empowered to approve **global tenders up to ₹200 crore**, reducing bureaucratic delays.
* Objective: Make procurement flexible, responsive, and supportive of India’s R\&D ecosystem.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **GeM (Government e-Marketplace)**: Introduced to promote transparency and efficiency in public procurement.
* **GFR Reforms 2025**: Addressed rigidity in procurement for R\&D institutions.
* **CSIR & IITs procurement autonomy** (to some extent, but still limited by compliance-heavy rules).
* Global models:

  * **Germany’s High-Tech Strategy & KOINNO** – use procurement to deliberately promote innovation.
  * **U.S. SBIR Program** – allocates 3% of federal R\&D funds for startups through staged procurement contracts.
  * **South Korea’s Pre-Commercial Procurement** – incentivises prototypes and cutting-edge tech.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

**Issues & Challenges**:

* Standardised rules discourage customised procurement.
* Low direct purchase limits still insufficient for frontier sciences (quantum, biotech).
* Dependence on global tenders risks sidelining domestic innovators.
* Risk of corruption/misuse if discretion is unchecked.

**Impacts**:

* **Positive**: Faster access to specialised tools, improved quality of research, potential crowding-in of private R\&D.
* **Negative**: Possible overreliance on imports, limited domestic innovation stimulation.

**Governance/Ethics**:

* Balancing autonomy of institutional heads with accountability mechanisms.
* Need for transparent monitoring without returning to bureaucratic bottlenecks.

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Outcome-weighted procurement** – Evaluate tenders not just on cost but also on innovation potential, R\&D intensity, and scalability.
2. **Sandbox exemptions** – Allow select institutions (IITs, IISc, TIFR) to bypass GFR for a fraction of their purchases, with annual third-party audits.
3. **AI-driven procurement** – Use AI tools (via **INDIAai**) to predict delays, scan global catalogues, and suggest alternatives in real time.
4. **Co-procurement alliances** – Labs can pool demand for high-cost items (like cryogenic coolers) to reduce cost and ensure quality.
5. **Hybrid governance models** – Adopt performance-linked contracts (like U.S. Sandia Labs) for select CSIR labs, combining public oversight with private agility.
6. **Domestic R\&D strengthening** – Pair global procurement flexibility with schemes to support Indian suppliers and startups in high-tech sectors.

# India’s economic ambitions need better gender data
## Women’s Economic Empowerment (WEE) Index

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Female Labour Force Participation Rate (FLFPR)**: Percentage of women who are working or actively looking for work. India’s FLFPR is **41.7%**, but only **18% are in formal jobs**.
* **Women’s contribution to GDP**: Currently **18%**, much lower than global averages (e.g., China \~40%).
* **Gender-disaggregated data**: Breaking down statistics by gender to highlight inequities. Without it, women’s exclusion remains invisible in policy.
* **WEE Index**: A district-level tool launched by **Uttar Pradesh government**, tracking women’s participation across five levers:

  1. Employment
  2. Education & Skilling
  3. Entrepreneurship
  4. Livelihood & Mobility
  5. Safety & Inclusive Infrastructure

### 2. **The News**

* **Uttar Pradesh** became the **first state in India** to launch the **Women’s Economic Empowerment (WEE) Index**.
* Purpose: To embed a **gender lens in governance**, making women’s economic participation **visible, measurable, and actionable**.
* Example impact: In UP’s transport sector, low female representation in bus staff was revealed. This led to changes in recruitment strategies and provision of women-friendly infrastructure (e.g., restrooms at bus terminals).

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Gender Budgeting** (introduced in India in 2005–06 Union Budget): Allocates funds specifically addressing women’s needs, though often limited to welfare schemes.
* **Mission Shakti (2020)**: Umbrella scheme focusing on women’s safety, security, and empowerment.
* **Stand-Up India & Mudra Yojana**: Support for women entrepreneurs through credit access.
* **Skill India Mission & PMKVY**: Large-scale skilling programmes, with high female enrolment but low transition to entrepreneurship.
* **NITI Aayog’s Women Entrepreneurship Platform**: Aims to promote women-led startups.
* **Global inspirations**:

  * OECD nations use **gender-disaggregated data systems** for education, employment, and health.
  * **Gender Responsive Budgeting (GRB)** frameworks in countries like Australia, Canada, and South Korea embed gender perspectives across sectors.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

**Issues & Challenges**:

* Women’s economic invisibility due to lack of data.
* Dropouts after Class 12 and post-graduation create employment gaps.
* Barriers to credit and finance despite high skilling participation.
* Gender budgeting seen as tokenistic, not systemic.
* Patriarchal norms restricting women’s mobility and safety.

**Impacts**:

* **Economic**: Exclusion of 196 million employable women shrinks GDP potential.
* **Social**: Persistent gender inequity in jobs, entrepreneurship, leadership.
* **Governance**: Without gender-specific data, policies fail to target real gaps.
* **Ethics**: Equity, justice, and fairness compromised if half the population is not included in growth narratives.

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Mainstream gender-disaggregated data**: Integrate into every departmental MIS (transport, MSMEs, housing, etc.).
2. **Expand the WEE Index nationally**: Encourage other states (AP, Maharashtra, Odisha, Telangana) to adopt similar district-level indices.
3. **Reimagine gender budgeting**: Apply a gender lens to all public spending, not just women-centric schemes.
4. **Address systemic barriers**: Ensure women’s access to credit, mentorship, market linkages, and infrastructure (safe mobility, child care, digital literacy).
5. **Track beyond participation**: Focus on retention, re-entry (after maternity/career breaks), and leadership representation.
6. **Promote outcome-driven skilling**: Move from training numbers to ensuring employability, entrepreneurship, and income generation.
7. **Public-private partnerships**: Incentivise corporates to create women-inclusive workplaces through CSR and ESG-linked investments.

# Court’s nod to mental health as right
## Supreme Court on Mental Health & Student Suicides: *Sukdeb Saha vs State of Andhra Pradesh (2025)*

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Article 21 of the Constitution**: Guarantees the *Right to Life and Personal Liberty*. Over the years, its interpretation has expanded to include dignity, livelihood, environment, and now, mental health.
* **Mental Healthcare Act, 2017**: Provides the *statutory* right to mental healthcare but suffers from weak implementation.
* **Victimology**: The study of victims and their relationship with perpetrators and systems. Extending this to institutions highlights how neglect or structural barriers can also victimize.
* **Structural Violence (Johan Galtung)**: Harm caused not by direct acts but by systemic structures that deny people dignity, opportunity, or basic needs.

### 2. **The News**

* In **July 2025**, the **Supreme Court of India** delivered a landmark judgment in *Sukdeb Saha vs State of Andhra Pradesh*.
* The case arose after the **suicide of a 17-year-old NEET aspirant** in a Visakhapatnam hostel. Her father alleged **failure of local police** to investigate and demanded a **CBI inquiry**.
* Beyond ordering the CBI probe, the Court:

  * Recognised **mental health as an integral part of the Right to Life under Article 21**.
  * Issued binding **“Saha Guidelines”** requiring schools, colleges, hostels, and coaching institutes to build mental health support systems.
  * Directed all States/UTs to operationalise rules within **two months** and establish **district-level monitoring committees**.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Mental Healthcare Act, 2017**: Grants rights to access mental health care, confidentiality, and community living. However, poor enforcement and lack of funding limit its impact.
* **National Mental Health Programme (1982)**: Early step to integrate mental health into primary care; yet remains underfunded.
* **Manodarpan Initiative (2020, MoE)**: Psychological support for students during COVID-19, but coverage limited.
* **National Education Policy (2020)**: Mentions well-being, but lacks enforceable provisions for mental health safeguards.
* **Judicial Evolution of Article 21**: Expanded in *Francis Coralie Mullin* (1981), *Bandhua Mukti Morcha* (1984), and *Puttaswamy* (2017). Sukdeb Saha continues this tradition by explicitly including **psychological well-being**.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

**Issues & Challenges**:

* High rate of **student suicides** (especially in coaching hubs like Kota, Hyderabad, Delhi).
* **Cultural stigma** around mental health; reluctance to seek help.
* **Exploitation by coaching institutes** — hyper-competitive environment, long hours, poor hostel conditions.
* **Institutional neglect** — schools/universities lack counsellors, grievance redressal, or safe spaces.
* **Governance gaps** — Mental Healthcare Act under-implemented; funding for mental health <1% of health budget.

**Impacts**:

* **Societal**: Loss of young talent, intergenerational trauma for families.
* **Economic**: Productivity loss from 196 million women and millions of youth outside labour markets worsens with untreated mental health issues.
* **Legal**: The verdict sets a *constitutional standard*, elevating mental health from a statutory to a **fundamental right**.
* **Ethical**: Poses questions of justice and fairness — is systemic neglect as culpable as active harm?

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Institutional Mental Health Framework**: Mandatory counsellors, helplines, peer-support networks in all schools, colleges, hostels, and coaching centres.
2. **Accountability & Monitoring**: Effective implementation of the **Saha Guidelines** with transparent district-level committees.
3. **Curriculum Reform**: Reduce overemphasis on rote-based competitive exams; promote holistic education (per NEP 2020 spirit).
4. **Strengthen the Mental Healthcare Act**: Increase funding, expand insurance coverage, enforce compliance by states.
5. **Awareness Campaigns**: Normalise conversations on mental health to fight stigma; involve parents, teachers, and communities.
6. **Restorative Measures**: Beyond punitive actions, focus on preventive and rehabilitative interventions — regular audits of coaching centres, hostel conditions, and stress management workshops.
7. **Judicial Follow-up**: SC should set up a compliance review mechanism, like in Vishaka Guidelines (sexual harassment, 1997), until Parliament enacts a comprehensive code.

# ‘India is keen to preserve its ties with U.S., but not at any cost’
## India’s Foreign Policy Challenges in a Changing World Order

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **SCO (Shanghai Cooperation Organisation)**: A Eurasian political, security, and economic grouping led by China and Russia, of which India is a member.
* **India–China Relations**: Strained since the 2020 Galwan clash; marked by border disputes, trade imbalance, and strategic rivalry in the neighbourhood.
* **India–U.S. Relations**: Deepening defence and strategic partnership (QUAD, Indo-Pacific) but strained by trade disputes, tariffs, and disagreements on Russia/Ukraine.
* **India–Russia Relations**: Strong defence and energy ties; India abstained on UN resolutions against Russia in the Ukraine war, drawing Western criticism.
* **Operation Sindoor** (as referenced): Context of Chinese and U.S. manoeuvres in South Asia that revived questions of regional alignments.
* **Global Order**: Post-1945 institutions (UN, IMF, World Bank, WTO) increasingly seen as outdated; rising powers like India demand reforms.

### 2. **The News**

* In an interview with *The Hindu*, **T.S. Tirumurti** (former PR to the UN) reflected on:

  * **India–China**: Some symbolic thaw (airlinks, visas, pilgrimages) but no substantive “new normal”; major issues like de-escalation and trade imbalance persist. China’s encirclement and Pakistan support remain serious concerns.
  * **India–U.S.**: Relationship faces turbulence — tariffs (50%), criticism over Russian oil imports, and U.S. outreach to Pakistan post-Operation Sindoor. India insists ties cannot be “episodic.”
  * **India–Russia & Ukraine**: India’s abstentions in UN votes were correct, but Tirumurti urges India to engage more actively to deflect Western criticism, recalling India’s Korean War diplomacy.
  * **Global Order**: It is fragmented — simultaneous conflict and cooperation (climate change, AI, pandemics). India must shed passive non-alignment and play a proactive role befitting a rising power.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Act East & Neighbourhood First Policies**: Balancing China’s influence in Asia.
* **QUAD & Indo-Pacific Strategy**: Strengthening ties with U.S., Japan, Australia to counterbalance China.
* **SCO Membership**: Provides platform to engage Russia and Central Asia while keeping channels open with China.
* **Energy Diplomacy**: Discounted Russian oil imports amid Western sanctions.
* **Multilateral Advocacy**: Push for UN Security Council reform; India’s leadership in **G20 (2023)**, climate action, and global health (Vaccine Maitri).

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

**Issues & Challenges**:

* Managing **China as both a neighbour and a superpower** — dual role complicates India’s strategy.
* **Trade disputes with the U.S.** — tariffs, market access, and differences over Russia.
* Balancing **strategic autonomy** vs. alignment pressures in a polarised world.
* Lack of meaningful reform in **global governance institutions** limits India’s influence.
* Domestic expectation: To align foreign policy with **India @2047 goals** of becoming a \$30 trillion economy and global power.

**Impacts**:

* **Strategic**: India must navigate U.S.–China rivalry while keeping Russia engaged.
* **Economic**: Tariffs and market access issues could slow growth in exports and technology cooperation.
* **Geopolitical**: India’s stance on Ukraine tests its credibility as a global leader.
* **Ethical/Normative**: India seeks to uphold sovereignty and non-intervention principles while being pressured to take sides.

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **India–China**: Pursue parallel tracks — de-escalation at the border + demand reciprocal trade access; build deterrence while engaging.
2. **India–U.S.**: Institutionalise ties beyond episodic irritants; push for balanced trade deals, expand defence-tech cooperation, and leverage diaspora diplomacy.
3. **India–Russia**: Maintain energy and defence links while nudging Moscow toward diplomacy; avoid overdependence that hurts relations with the West.
4. **Ukraine Engagement**: Play a more active diplomatic role (track II dialogues, humanitarian initiatives) to deflect criticism and position India as a peace enabler.
5. **Multilateral Reforms**: Intensify push for UNSC reform, fairer WTO rules, and Global South solidarity through platforms like BRICS+, SCO, and G20.
6. **Strategic Autonomy 2.0**: Move beyond passive non-alignment to **issue-based, proactive engagement**, balancing values with interests.
7. **Domestic Linkages**: Align foreign policy with **economic growth strategy** (FDI, technology transfer, supply-chain resilience) to support India’s 2047 goals.

# SC on anticipatory bail in caste crime
## Supreme Court on Anticipatory Bail under SC/ST Act: *Kiran vs Rajkumar Jivaraj Jain (2025)*

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989**: Enacted to protect Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes from caste-based discrimination, violence, and atrocities. It creates **special offences** and stricter procedural rules.
* **Anticipatory Bail**: A pre-arrest bail under Section 438 of the CrPC (Section 482 of BNSS, 2023) that protects individuals from arrest.
* **Section 18 of the SC/ST Act**: Expressly bars anticipatory bail if a **prima facie** case of caste atrocity is made out. Rationale: to prevent intimidation, pressure, or further violence against victims.
* **Prima Facie Test**: At the bail stage, courts must only see whether allegations disclose an offence, not evaluate evidence or conduct a “mini-trial.”

### 2. **The News**

* On **September 1, 2025**, the **Supreme Court** quashed a **Bombay High Court order** granting anticipatory bail to an accused of caste crimes.
* **Case**: *Kiran vs Rajkumar Jivaraj Jain*.
* **Facts**:

  * Victim, a Scheduled Caste member, alleged caste-based assault, abuse, molestation of female relatives, looting, and threats linked to his refusal to vote as directed in Assembly elections.
  * Sessions Court denied anticipatory bail; High Court granted it citing political motivation.
  * Supreme Court reversed the High Court order, reaffirming the **bar on anticipatory bail** under Section 18 of the SC/ST Act.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **SC/ST Act Amendments (2015 & 2018)**: Expanded scope of offences, introduced presumption against anticipatory bail, and made investigation/special courts mandatory.
* **Judicial Precedents**:

  * *State of M.P. vs Ram Krishna Balothia (1995)* – bar on anticipatory bail upheld as constitutional.
  * *Vilas Pandurang Pawar vs State of Maharashtra (2012)* – reaffirmed bar.
  * *Prathvi Raj Chauhan vs Union of India (2020)* – anticipatory bail possible only if no prima facie case exists.
* **Institutional Mechanisms**: Designated special courts, exclusive public prosecutors, and victim/witness protection measures under the Act.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

**Issues & Challenges**:

* Frequent misuse allegations vs. the real problem of underreporting caste atrocities.
* High courts often dilute legislative intent by giving anticipatory bail.
* Victims face threats, intimidation, and social boycotts, making protection vital.
* Electoral dimension: linking caste violence with voting rights undermines democracy.

**Impacts**:

* **Social Justice**: Strengthens dignity and security of Dalits and Adivasis.
* **Legal**: Reinforces Parliament’s intent to create a special statutory regime to check caste-based violence.
* **Democratic**: Protects SC/ST voters from coercion or retaliation.
* **Governance**: Signals strict accountability for enforcement agencies and lower courts.

**Ethics/Governance**:

* Protecting vulnerable groups aligns with **constitutional morality** (Ambedkar’s emphasis).
* Reinforces rule of law over caste-based power hierarchies.

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Judicial Discipline**: High Courts must avoid evidentiary analysis at the anticipatory bail stage; stick to prima facie test.
2. **Stronger Victim Support**: Ensure effective witness protection, legal aid, and rehabilitation schemes.
3. **Training of Judges & Police**: Sensitisation on caste realities and statutory duties under the SC/ST Act.
4. **Monitoring Mechanisms**: Establish special oversight committees for cases involving electoral violence against SC/STs.
5. **Community Awareness**: Encourage Dalit and tribal communities to report atrocities without fear of reprisal.
6. **Balance with Safeguards**: While misuse concerns exist, remedies like perjury charges or departmental action should address false cases — not dilution of protections.
