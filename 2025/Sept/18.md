# Letter and spirit
## Supreme Court on Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Waqf**: A permanent dedication of property by a Muslim for religious, pious, or charitable purposes recognized under Islamic law. Properties so endowed are inalienable and managed by Waqf Boards.
* **Waqf Act, 1995**: Governs waqf properties, their administration, and the Central/State Waqf Boards.
* **Amendment of 2025**: Introduced changes such as limiting who can create waqf, restricting ‚Äúwaqf by user,‚Äù and giving District Collectors powers in property disputes. It was justified by the government as a way to curb corruption, but criticized as interference in minority rights.
* **Constitutional Principles in Play**:

  * **Article 25 & 26**: Right to freely profess religion and manage religious affairs.
  * **Article 14**: Equality before law.
  * **Article 300A**: Right to property.
  * **Secularism**: Balance between religious autonomy and state oversight.

---

### 2. **The News**

* On **September 15, 2025**, the **Supreme Court of India delivered a judgment** on the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025.
* The Court:

  * **Stayed** provisions requiring that only Muslims practising for 5 years could create waqf.
  * **Struck down** Collector‚Äôs powers to adjudicate waqf disputes.
  * **Capped non-Muslim members** on Central (4) and State (3) Waqf Boards.
  * **Directed** that CEOs of Waqf Boards should preferably be Muslims.
  * **Upheld** removal of ‚Äúwaqf by user‚Äù recognition, except for properties registered before **April 8, 2025**.
  * **Validated** restrictions on waqf status for **protected monuments** and **tribal lands**.
* The ruling gave partial relief to both supporters and critics of the law.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Waqf Reforms (2025)**: Framed as anti-corruption and transparency measures.
* **Earlier Mechanisms**:

  * 1995 Waqf Act consolidated state and central administration.
  * **Central Waqf Council** (est. 1964) to advise on administration.
* **Parallel Examples**:

  * Government oversight in Hindu Endowments (e.g., temple trusts).
  * **SC‚Äôs jurisprudence** on balancing religious freedom and reform (e.g., Shirur Mutt case, Sabarimala).

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

* **Issues & Challenges**:

  * Balancing minority rights with accountability of institutions.
  * Risk of state overreach into religious affairs.
  * Concerns of selective targeting ‚Üí possible erosion of **secular trust**.
  * Corruption and misuse of waqf assets ‚Üí undermines community welfare.
* **Socio-Political Impact**:

  * Polarization risk if laws affecting religious communities lack consultation.
  * Property disputes ‚Üí major source of local tension.
* **Economic Impact**: Waqf properties (6+ lakh across India) are significant assets; mismanagement means loss of public welfare opportunities.
* **Ethical Angle**: Justice between state regulation (prevent misuse) vs religious autonomy (protect identity).

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

* **Inclusive Law-Making**: Broader consultation with community leaders, opposition, and civil society before amending sensitive laws.
* **Transparency Mechanisms**: Independent audits, public digital records of waqf assets.
* **Uniform Principles**: Apply oversight across religions (temple, church, gurudwara trusts) to avoid discrimination.
* **Dispute Resolution**: Independent tribunals instead of district collectors, ensuring neutrality.

# A judicial nudge following stuck legislative business
## SC on Governor‚Äôs Powers under Article 200

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Article 200**: Deals with the Governor‚Äôs options when a Bill passed by the State legislature is presented for assent. He may:

  1. Assent to the Bill.
  2. Withhold assent.
  3. Return the Bill to the Assembly for reconsideration.
  4. Reserve it for the President‚Äôs consideration.
* **Article 201**: When a Bill is reserved for the President, he may assent or withhold assent.
* **Governor‚Äôs Discretion**: Article 163 clarifies that the Governor acts on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers except in cases where the Constitution gives discretion. Article 200 does **not** explicitly grant discretion.
* **Historical Background**: The Government of India Act, 1935 (Section 75) mentioned ‚ÄúGovernor in his discretion.‚Äù The framers of the Constitution deliberately omitted these words in Article 200, suggesting Governors must act on ministerial advice.

---

### 2. **The News**

* On **September 15, 2025**, the **Supreme Court of India heard arguments on a Presidential Reference** regarding the Governor‚Äôs powers under **Article 200**.
* Earlier, a two-judge Bench led by Justice J.B. Pardiwala had directed that Governors and the President must decide on Bills within **three months**.
* This sparked debate since the Constitution does not prescribe any time limit.
* The Court stressed that Governors cannot act as ‚Äúsuper constitutional figures‚Äù and must generally follow the advice of the Council of Ministers.
* It clarified that sitting on Bills indefinitely undermines federalism and the functioning of elected governments.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Sarkaria Commission (1988)** & **Punchhi Commission (2010)**: Recommended Governors act on ministerial advice, with discretion only in rare cases (e.g., unconstitutional Bills).
* **Past Cases**:

  * *Shamsher Singh vs State of Punjab (1974)* ‚Üí Governor is a constitutional head, bound by ministerial advice.
  * *Nabam Rebia (2016)* ‚Üí Reiterated limited discretion of Governors.
  * *State of Punjab vs Principal Secretary to Governor (2023)* ‚Üí Court ruled that Governors cannot indefinitely delay Bills.
  * *State of Tamil Nadu vs Governor of Tamil Nadu (2025)* ‚Üí Withholding assent without advice is unconstitutional.
* **Article 355**: Duty of the Union to ensure State governments function in accordance with the Constitution. This may empower the Centre to intervene if a Governor paralyzes the legislative process.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

* **Federalism**: Indefinite delay in Bill assent disrupts State legislatures, undermining elected governments.
* **Separation of Powers**: Judiciary stepping in with timelines reflects a check against executive inaction.
* **Democratic Governance**: Highlights tension between *nominated authority (Governor)* and *elected authority (Council of Ministers)*.
* **Judicial Activism**: SC‚Äôs timeline-setting is an example of purposive interpretation ‚Äî similar to expansion of Article 21 in *Maneka Gandhi* case.
* **Ethical Dimension**: Misuse of constitutional offices for political ends raises governance concerns.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

* **Codify Time Frame**: Parliament may amend Articles 200/201 or frame a law fixing a reasonable time limit (say 3‚Äì6 months).
* **Neutral Role of Governors**: Governors should act as constitutional heads, not political actors.
* **Union‚Äôs Responsibility**: Invoke Article 355 in extreme cases to ensure compliance.
* **Judicial Oversight**: Courts should step in only as a last resort when constitutional paralysis occurs.
* **Political Consensus**: Reforming Centre‚ÄìState relations requires dialogue between ruling and opposition parties to depoliticize the role of Governors.

# Welfare at the mercy of the machine
## Facial Recognition Software in Anganwadis

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Anganwadis**: Set up in 1975 under the **Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS)**, these centres aim to tackle child malnutrition, provide early childhood education, and support pregnant/lactating women.
* **Take Home Rations (THR)**: Nutritious food entitlement under the **National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA)**, legally mandated for children under 3 years, and pregnant/lactating women.
* **Poshan Tracker (2021)**: A centralised app to monitor nutrition and beneficiary data. Now linked with **Facial Recognition Software (FRS)** for authentication.
* **Facial Recognition Software (FRS)**: A biometric technology that verifies individuals based on facial features. In India, it is now being used for ration distribution under ICDS.

---

### 2. **The News**

* Since **July 1, 2025**, THR in Anganwadis is given only after women authenticate their identity through **FRS** on the Poshan Tracker app.
* Aim: Prevent impersonation and theft of rations by either beneficiaries or Anganwadi workers.
* **Problems Reported**:

  * Errors in face matching.
  * Poor internet connectivity.
  * Outdated/low-capacity phones of Anganwadi Workers (AWWs).
  * OTP and e-KYC complications due to changed phone numbers.
  * Women denied rations even when AWWs personally knew them.
* Anganwadi workers face hostility from rightful beneficiaries when the system fails, without power to override the app.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **ICDS (1975)** ‚Üí Provided Anganwadis as part of nutritional and pre-school support.
* **NFSA, 2013** ‚Üí Made food entitlements a legal right.
* **Supreme Court Orders (2004 onward)** ‚Üí Directed decentralisation of food supply via self-help groups and Mahila Mandals, not large private contractors.
* **Poshan Abhiyaan (2018)** ‚Üí Digital tracking of nutritional outcomes, now leading to the **Poshan Tracker app**.
* **FRS Introduction (2025)** ‚Üí First large-scale use of facial recognition for welfare delivery in India.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

* **Issues & Challenges**:

  * **Technological exclusion** ‚Üí Women and children denied food due to glitches.
  * **Principle of natural justice** ‚Üí Assumes guilt of beneficiaries instead of innocence.
  * **Data privacy & ethics** ‚Üí Sensitive biometric data being collected without consent safeguards.
  * **Misplaced priorities** ‚Üí Core issues (poor quality food, irregular supply, stagnant budget of ‚Çπ8/day per child since 2018) remain unaddressed.
* **Social Impact**:

  * Risk of malnutrition and hunger due to denial of entitlements.
  * Burden on frontline workers who face anger from communities.
* **Governance & Policy Angle**:

  * Reflects a ‚Äútechnocratic‚Äù approach, privileging efficiency over empathy.
  * Lack of consultation with AWWs undermines participatory governance.
* **Ethical Dimension**:

  * Treating vulnerable women and children as ‚Äúpotential criminals.‚Äù
  * Friction between **authenticating beneficiaries** vs respecting their **authentic dignity**.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

* **Community-based Verification**: Local Anganwadi workers and community groups should authenticate beneficiaries rather than machines.
* **Decentralised Supply Chains**: Follow SC orders to empower SHGs and Mahila Mandals in ration production/distribution.
* **Digital Tools as Support, Not Gatekeepers**: Allow AWWs to override app failures if they vouch for authenticity.
* **Audit & Transparency**: Publish government data, if any, on ‚Äúfake beneficiaries‚Äù before imposing restrictive tech.
* **Upgrade Budget & Quality**: Revise THR allocations (unchanged since 2018), ensure quality food supply.
* **Safeguards on FRS**: If used, build grievance redressal, offline fallback options, and strict data privacy rules.
* **Rights over Technology**: Reaffirm that **entitlements are legal rights under NFSA**, not contingent on app performance.

## Supreme Court‚Äôs Interim Order on Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Waqf**: A permanent endowment under Islamic law where property is dedicated for religious or charitable purposes. Managed by Waqf Boards, it forms one of the largest categories of community-managed landholdings in India.
* **1995 Waqf Act**: Consolidated laws governing Waqf properties, their registration, and administration.
* **2025 Amendments**: Aimed at ‚Äúreforms and transparency‚Äù but criticized as excessive state control.
* **Constitutional Issues Involved**:

  * **Article 26**: Right of religious denominations to manage their own affairs.
  * **Article 30**: Right of minorities to establish and administer institutions.
  * **Separation of Powers**: Executive vs judicial authority in deciding property disputes.
  * **Equality and Non-discrimination** under Article 14.

---

### 2. **The News**

* On **September 15, 2025**, a **Supreme Court Bench led by CJI B.R. Gavai** issued an interim order on petitions challenging the **Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025**.
* The Court **refused to suspend the entire law** but stayed certain controversial provisions:

  * **District Collectors‚Äô powers** to decide Waqf ownership disputes.
  * Clause requiring a person to be a **practising Muslim for 5 years** before creating Waqf.
  * Automatic divestment of Waqf status once an inquiry commenced.
  * Excessive inclusion of **non-Muslims on Waqf Boards/Councils** (capped at 3 in State Boards and 4 in the Central Council).
* The Court upheld:

  * Removal of ‚Äú**Waqf by user**‚Äù doctrine prospectively.
  * Mandatory **digital registration** of Waqf properties.
  * Application of the **Limitation Act, 1963** to Waqf properties.
* It clarified that **tribal lands and protected monuments cannot be declared Waqf**, given constitutional and statutory safeguards.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Waqf Act, 1995**: Created a statutory framework for administration of Waqf properties.
* **Amendment 2025**:

  * Introduced centralised digital registration.
  * Gave executive officers (Collectors) powers over disputes.
  * Removed ‚ÄúWaqf by user‚Äù to prevent alleged encroachments.
  * Introduced 5-year practising Muslim requirement.
* **Government‚Äôs Argument**: Reform was needed to **reduce litigation, improve accountability, and prevent misuse/encroachment** of vast Waqf properties.
* **Judicial Commissions** (Sarkaria, Punchhi): Earlier highlighted risks of executive overreach in minority affairs.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

* **Issues & Challenges**:

  * **Minority Rights vs State Regulation**: Whether state oversight compromises the community‚Äôs autonomy.
  * **Executive Overreach**: Collectors deciding ownership disputes violated **separation of powers**.
  * **Religious Freedom**: 5-year practice clause could lead to ‚Äúreligiosity policing.‚Äù
  * **Encroachment Concerns**: Abolition of Waqf-by-user protects government lands but also curtails traditional recognition.
  * **Inclusivity vs Autonomy**: Non-Muslim presence on Boards may enhance oversight but risks undermining Article 26 rights.
* **Impacts**:

  * **Legal**: Interim balance between protecting Waqf assets and avoiding misuse.
  * **Political**: Highly sensitive minority issue with opposition parties and civil society critical of state overreach.
  * **Governance**: Digital registration and limitation periods may bring transparency but also restrict flexibility in reclaiming encroachments.
* **Ethical/Governance Angle**: The dilemma between ensuring **transparency and accountability** in community institutions vs preserving **dignity and self-governance**.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

* **Judicial Safeguards**: Leave property disputes to **tribunals/courts**, not executive officers.
* **Community Consultation**: Law-making in sensitive religious matters must involve dialogue with stakeholders for wider acceptance.
* **Balanced Oversight**: Non-Muslim representation should be minimal and advisory, not decision-making.
* **Transparency Mechanisms**: Strengthen audits, digital tracking, and community participation to prevent corruption.
* **Respect for Religious Freedom**: Drop arbitrary requirements like ‚Äú5-year practising Muslim,‚Äù which risk violating Articles 25‚Äì26.
* **Uniform Principles**: Any regulation of religious endowments should be consistent across communities (Hindu temples, Church trusts, Gurudwaras), to avoid selective targeting.
