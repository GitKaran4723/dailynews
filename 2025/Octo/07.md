# Calling out the criticism of the Indian judiciary
---

## Judiciary and Development: Debunking the Myth of “Courts as the Biggest Hurdle”

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Viksit Bharat:** A vision of a *developed India by 2047*, symbolizing economic prosperity, social equity, and institutional efficiency.
* **Judiciary’s Role:** The judiciary in India serves as a **check on executive and legislative power**, ensures **rule of law**, and protects **fundamental rights**. Judicial independence is central to India’s **constitutional democracy**.
* **Current Debate:** Certain policymakers and economists argue that the judiciary — through judicial delays and interference — hampers India’s growth and ease of doing business.
* **Commercial Courts Act, 2015 (Section 12A):** Mandates **pre-suit mediation** before commercial litigation to promote alternative dispute resolution. Critics argue that poor design, not judicial inefficiency, causes its limited success.
* **Core Issue:** The friction lies not between *law and growth*, but between **poor governance, over-legislation, and administrative inefficiency**, which are wrongly projected as judicial failings.

---

### 2. **The News**

* **Trigger:** Sanjeev Sanyal, member of the **Prime Minister’s Economic Advisory Council**, recently stated that the *judicial system is the single biggest hurdle* in India’s path to becoming “Viksit Bharat.”
* **Venue:** *Nyaya Nirman Conference* (2025).
* **Argument Summary:**

  * Judiciary delays projects and hinders business efficiency.
  * Courts spend excessive time on trivial or avoidable cases.
  * Judges work limited hours and take long vacations.
* **Counterpoints (Editorial Perspective):**

  * Courts enforce laws made by Parliament — they do not create procedural roadblocks.
  * Judicial burden largely arises from **government litigation**, **poorly drafted laws**, and **administrative failures**.
  * Many “delays” stem from **policy gaps** and **bad governance**, not judicial obstruction.
* **Example:** Section 12A of the Commercial Courts Act was introduced by Parliament, not the judiciary; thus, its inefficiency reflects legislative design flaws.
* **Core Critique:** Blaming courts is **politically convenient** and **misinformed** — it diverts attention from the systemic deficiencies in India’s **law-making and executive accountability**.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Judicial Reforms Efforts:**

  * **e-Courts Mission Mode Project:** Digitalization of court records and virtual hearings.
  * **National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG):** Online repository of case statistics to track pendency and performance.
  * **Fast Track and Commercial Courts:** Established for time-bound disposal of specific categories of cases.
  * **All India Judicial Service (AIJS)** — proposed to streamline recruitment and reduce vacancies in lower judiciary.
  * **Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR):** Mediation, arbitration, and Lok Adalats to reduce court burden.

* **Legislative and Executive Challenges:**

  * **Frequent and vague lawmaking:** Rebranding of criminal codes (Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, etc.) without addressing underlying procedural inefficiencies.
  * **Government as the largest litigant:** Nearly **50% of pending cases** involve government departments.
  * **Vacancies & Infrastructure gaps:** Over **5,000 judicial vacancies** and poor lower court infrastructure hinder timely justice.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

**Paper:** GS-II (Polity & Governance – Judiciary; Separation of Powers; Accountability)

**Key Issues & Challenges:**

* **Judicial Delays:** 5 crore+ pending cases; average case duration in district courts exceeds 6 years.
* **Vacancies:** Delays in appointments, especially in High Courts and district courts.

* **Legislative Ambiguity:** Vague drafting leads to repeated interpretation disputes.
* **Perception Problem:** Simplistic criticism erodes public confidence in the judiciary and undermines judicial independence.
* **Governance Ethics:** Shifting blame from executive inefficiency to judiciary weakens democratic checks and balances.

**Analytical Angle:**

* Courts do delay economic processes, but largely because **governments themselves** are the biggest litigants and **laws are poorly conceived**.
* Judicial criticism must be **data-driven and reform-oriented**, not **rhetorical**.
* A strong judiciary ensures **predictability, contract enforcement, and investor confidence** — the very foundations of a “Viksit Bharat.”

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

**1. Strengthen the Lower Judiciary:**

* Prioritize filling vacancies and improving infrastructure.
* Implement a **National Judicial Infrastructure Authority (NJIA)** to modernize court systems.

**2. Reduce Government Litigation:**

* Introduce a **“litigation accountability framework”** — officials to justify appeals before filing.

## Nobel Prize 2025: Breakthroughs in Autoimmune Regulation and the Discovery of Regulatory T-Cells

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Autoimmunity:**

  * A condition in which the immune system mistakenly attacks the body’s own tissues, perceiving them as foreign.
  * Examples: Type 1 diabetes, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis.

* **Self-Tolerance:**

  * The ability of the immune system to distinguish between “self” and “non-self” antigens.
  * Traditionally, this was thought to occur through **deletion of self-reactive T-cells** in the thymus (central tolerance).

* **Regulatory T-Cells (Tregs):**

  * A subset of **CD4⁺ T-cells** that suppress overactive immune responses and maintain immune homeostasis.
  * Tregs are crucial for **peripheral tolerance** — controlling self-reactive T-cells that escape deletion in the thymus.

* **FOXP3 (Forkhead box P3):**

  * A **transcription factor** (gene regulatory protein) identified as the “master switch” controlling Treg differentiation and function.
  * Mutations in FOXP3 cause severe autoimmune disorders, such as **IPEX syndrome** (Immune dysregulation, Polyendocrinopathy, Enteropathy, X-linked).

* **Key Scientists Honoured:**

  * **Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi** — recognised for defining the genetic and cellular basis of immune self-tolerance through Tregs and FOXP3.

---

### 2. **The News**

* The **2025 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine** was awarded to **Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi** for discoveries that revolutionised the understanding of **autoimmune regulation**.
* **Sakaguchi (1995):** Identified a subset of **CD4⁺ T-cells** whose absence caused autoimmune disease in mice, establishing their role as *regulatory T-cells (Tregs).*
* **Brunkow & Ramsdell (late 1990s):** Studying *scurfy mice*, they pinpointed a mutation in a gene on the **X chromosome**, later named **FOXP3**, which when lost caused fatal autoimmune collapse.
* The link between FOXP3 mutations and **human autoimmune disorders** confirmed that **Tregs are central to maintaining immune balance**.
* This discovery bridged the gap between **molecular genetics** and **immune physiology**, creating new paradigms for understanding autoimmunity, transplantation, and cancer.
* The Nobel citation highlights how **industry-based research** (Celltech Chiroscience) significantly contributed to fundamental biology.

# Reforming passive euthanasia in India
---

## India, Euthanasia, and the Right to Die with Dignity

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Euthanasia:** Refers to intentionally ending a person’s life to relieve suffering.

  * **Active euthanasia:** A deliberate act (e.g., administering a lethal injection).
  * **Passive euthanasia:** Withholding or withdrawing medical treatment that only prolongs life artificially.
* **Assisted Dying / Physician-Assisted Suicide:** The patient self-administers a lethal substance prescribed by a doctor.
* **Ethical Debate:** Balances the **right to life and dignity** (Article 21, Indian Constitution) against **moral, cultural, and religious values** that sanctify life.
* **Indian Position:**

  * Recognises **passive euthanasia** under specific conditions.
  * Does **not** permit **active euthanasia**.
  * Grounded in the principle that allowing death is different from causing death.

---

### 2. **The News**

* In **June 2025**, the **U.K. House of Commons** passed the **Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill**, permitting **physician-assisted dying** for mentally competent adults expected to live fewer than **six months**.
* The Bill, awaiting approval from the **House of Lords**, represents a **major legal and ethical milestone**.
* It reignited global debates on **end-of-life rights**, including in India.
* In India, although **passive euthanasia** is legally permitted, **procedural complexities** — such as multiple medical board approvals and occasional judicial involvement — have made it **practically inaccessible**.
* Families often take decisions informally, leaving doctors legally vulnerable and eroding patient dignity.
* The editorial argues for **streamlining India’s passive euthanasia system**, not expanding to active euthanasia, due to India’s **cultural sensitivities**, **institutional weaknesses**, and **socio-economic disparities**.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Judicial Developments in India**

* **Key Judgments:**

  * **Aruna Shanbaug Case (2011):**

    * The Supreme Court allowed *passive euthanasia* in exceptional cases under strict judicial oversight.
  * **Common Cause v. Union of India (2018):**

    * Recognised the **Right to Die with Dignity** as part of **Article 21**.
    * Legalised **advance medical directives (“living wills”)** under stringent procedures.
  * **2023 Simplification:**

    * The Supreme Court **relaxed procedural requirements** — now, only two medical boards’ approval is needed (no longer court approval).

* **Legal Basis:**

  * **Article 21:** Right to life includes the right to live with dignity, and by extension, to die with dignity.
  * **Indian Penal Code (Sections 306 & 309):** Still criminalise abetment or attempt to suicide — reflecting the ethical tension.

* **Institutional Mechanisms Proposed:**

  * Medical Boards at **hospital and district levels**.
  * Advance directives to be authenticated by magistrates (yet slow in practice).
  * National Health Policy (2017) and **National Palliative Care Programme (2012)** focus on compassionate end-of-life care but lack adequate implementation.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

**Paper:** GS-II (Polity & Governance – Judiciary, Rights, Ethics) | GS-IV (Ethics – Human Values, Medical Ethics)

**Key Issues & Challenges:**

* **Ethical Dilemmas:**

  * Balancing autonomy and sanctity of life.
  * Risk of **coercion** in poor or dependent individuals if active euthanasia is allowed.
* **Implementation Gaps:**

  * Current passive euthanasia framework is **too bureaucratic**.
  * **Advance directives** rarely registered due to lack of awareness and procedural burden.
  * Doctors and hospitals fear **legal consequences** due to ambiguity.
* **Institutional Constraints:**

  * Fragmented health system, weak palliative care infrastructure, and inconsistent ethical review mechanisms.
* **Socio-Cultural Context:**

  * Deep family involvement, religious beliefs, and low literacy make *autonomous medical decisions* complex.
* **Constitutional Interpretation:**

  * Article 21 ensures dignity but **not a right to be killed**.
  * The **line between omission and commission** remains crucial in Indian jurisprudence.

**Ethical Dimensions:**

* **Utilitarianism vs. Deontology:** Should suffering reduction justify ending life?
* **Justice & Equity:** Only the wealthy may access dignified death under regulated systems.
* **Medical Ethics:** “Do no harm” vs. “Do not prolong harm.”

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

**1. Reform Passive Euthanasia Framework:**

* Simplify and digitise procedures using a **National Advance Directive Portal** linked with Aadhaar for secure registration, updating, and revocation.
* Empower **hospital-based ethics committees** (including palliative care specialists and independent observers) to decide within **48 hours**.

**2. Ensure Accountability with Compassion:**

* Build a **digital oversight system** for transparency — not bureaucracy.
* Independent **medical auditors or commissioners** at State level to review compliance.

**3. Strengthen Palliative & End-of-Life Care:**

* Integrate **palliative care training** in medical curricula.
* Expand government funding for pain management and home-based hospice care.

**4. Safeguards Against Abuse:**

* Mandatory **cooling-off period (7 days)**, **psychological counselling**, and **palliative review** before decision finalisation.
* Periodic audits to prevent misuse, especially against elderly or disabled patients.

**5. Public Awareness & Ethical Discourse:**

* Conduct campaigns on **living wills** and **advance care planning** in regional languages.
* Promote public discussion to destigmatise end-of-life conversations.

**6. Contextual Approach (Not Imitation):**

* India must **chart its own path** based on *constitutional morality, cultural ethos, and healthcare realities*.
* The focus should be on **making passive euthanasia humane, accessible, and ethically sound**, not importing active euthanasia laws from Western contexts.

---

✅ **Summary Insight:**
The U.K.’s move towards **assisted dying** reopens India’s debate on end-of-life rights. While **active euthanasia** remains ethically and institutionally premature for India, the **right to die with dignity** demands that **passive euthanasia laws be made workable**. A **digitally enabled, compassionate, and well-regulated framework**—rooted in **Indian constitutional and moral values**—can humanise death without compromising ethics or equality.

# Deliberations continue on proposed nuclear Bill
---

## Private Sector Entry into Nuclear Power: India’s Emerging Legislative Reform

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Nuclear Energy in India:**
  India’s nuclear programme has historically been **state-controlled** due to concerns over **security, safety, and proliferation**. The Atomic Energy Act, 1962, vests **exclusive rights** of developing and operating nuclear installations with the **central government and its agencies** (NPCIL and BHAVINI).

* **Private Sector Restrictions:**
  Private players cannot currently own or operate nuclear reactors — they can only act as **suppliers or contractors** under NPCIL supervision.

* **Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act (CLND), 2010:**

  * Assigns **operator liability** in case of nuclear accidents, but also allows operators to seek compensation from suppliers (the “right of recourse”).
  * This clause deterred foreign suppliers (like GE, Westinghouse) from entering India, fearing **unlimited liability**.

* **Convention on Supplementary Compensation (CSC):**
  An international treaty setting **uniform global standards** for nuclear accident compensation — caps supplier liability and defines compensation sharing between nations.
  India acceded to CSC in 2016 but its **domestic laws remain misaligned**, limiting private participation.

---

### 2. **The News**

# Can a third party be liable for marital disruption?
---

## Delhi High Court’s Landmark Ruling on *Alienation of Affection (AoA)*: Civil Damages for Third-Party Interference in Marriage

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Alienation of Affection (AoA):**
  A *“heart-balm” tort* from Anglo-American common law, allowing one spouse to sue a **third party (paramour)** for intentionally and maliciously interfering in a marriage, causing *loss of affection, companionship, or consortium*.

* **Legal Basis:**

  * AoA is **not codified in Indian law**, but the **Supreme Court in *Pinakin Mahipatray Rawal v. State of Gujarat (2013)*** recognised that *alienation of affection by a stranger, if proved, constitutes an intentional tort.*
  * It rests on the idea that marriage creates a *protectable legal interest* in emotional companionship and mutual support.

* **Contrast with Adultery:**

  * **Adultery** (Section 497 IPC) was *decriminalised* in ***Joseph Shine v. Union of India (2018)***, but remains a *civil wrong* — a valid ground for divorce and possibly for tort claims like AoA.
  * The **Joseph Shine** ruling declared that *marital infidelity cannot attract criminal punishment*, yet did not bar civil remedies for emotional harm.

---

### 2. **The News**

* In ***Shelly Mahajan v. Ms. Bhanushree Bahl & Anr (2025)***, the **Delhi High Court** admitted a **civil suit filed by a wife** against her husband’s alleged affair partner, seeking damages for *Alienation of Affection (AoA)*.

* The Court:

  * Overruled objections on maintainability.
  * Held that civil courts can hear such tort claims against third parties.
  * Issued summons to the defendant, signalling India’s **first judicial recognition of an actionable civil claim** for interference in marriage.

* The HC clarified:

  * *Joseph Shine* decriminalised adultery but **did not create a “licence” for extramarital affairs** free from civil or legal consequences.
  * AoA claims remain legally open in India as there is **no statutory prohibition**.
  * The interference must involve **intentional, wrongful, and malicious conduct** that **caused the marital breakdown.**

* **Three-fold Test laid down by the Court:**

  1. **Intentional and wrongful conduct** by the third party directed at alienating the marital relationship.
  2. **Causation** — a clear link between that conduct and the marital breakdown or loss of affection.
  3. **Legally cognisable injury** — the emotional or reputational loss must be rationally assessable in monetary terms.

---

### 3. **Government & Judicial Context**

**A. Key Judicial Developments:**

* **Joseph Shine v. Union of India (2018):**

  * Struck down criminalisation of adultery as unconstitutional.
  * Upheld the *right to privacy and equality* of spouses.
  * Affirmed adultery as a *civil ground for divorce* but not a punishable offence.
* **Indra Sarma v. V.K.V. Sarma (2013):**

  * Suggested that even children may have a cause of action if a third party disrupts the family unit.
* **Pinakin Mahipatray Rawal v. State of Gujarat (2013):**

  * Acknowledged that *alienation of affection by a third party* may constitute an **intentional tort** if proven.

**B. Legal Framework in India:**

* **Hindu Marriage Act, 1955** and other matrimonial laws:

  * Provide remedies **only between spouses** (e.g., divorce, maintenance).
  * Do not address third-party interference.
* **Civil Courts’ Jurisdiction:**

  * Family courts have exclusive jurisdiction over *matrimonial causes*, but not over *tort claims against third parties*.
  * Hence, AoA claims fall under **civil court jurisdiction**.

**C. Comparative Context (U.S. Jurisprudence):**

* AoA suits exist in only a few U.S. states (e.g., North Carolina, Utah, Hawaii).
* Most states abolished them for being **archaic**, **misogynistic**, or **prone to abuse**.
* Courts that retain AoA require strict proof of *malice and causation*.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

**Paper:** GS-II (Polity & Constitution – Judiciary, Rights) | GS-IV (Ethics – Human Values, Family System, Privacy, Morality)

**Key Issues & Analysis:**

* **1. Autonomy vs. Morality:**

  * The Delhi HC ruling balances *individual privacy* (protected under Article 21) and *marital sanctity* as a social institution.
  * Raises the question: should *personal infidelity* become a matter of public civil liability?

* **2. Gender Implications:**

  * Historically, “heart-balm” suits often reinforced patriarchal notions — treating women as property in marriage.
  * Modern interpretation must protect both spouses equally, recognising emotional harm as genuine, not ownership-based.

* **3. Legal Ambiguity:**

  * India lacks a **civil codification of marital torts**, leading to uncertainty in damages, jurisdiction, and evidentiary standards.

* **4. Ethical Concerns:**

  * Potential misuse: frivolous or retaliatory suits may weaponise personal relationships.
  * Yet, ignoring deliberate harm to a marital bond may deny justice to genuinely wronged spouses.

* **5. Socio-Legal Significance:**

  * Revives debate on **civil consequences of adultery post–Joseph Shine**.
  * May expand the scope of **family law torts** in India, influencing privacy and emotional injury jurisprudence.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

**1. Codify Civil Remedies for Marital Torts:**

* Enact clear legal standards for **civil liability** in cases of intentional marital interference.
* Define limits on damages, burden of proof, and protection against misuse.

**2. Maintain Balance Between Rights:**

* Ensure that AoA suits **do not violate privacy** or autonomy.
* The law should target **malicious interference**, not consensual adult choices.

**3. Strengthen Family Court & Civil Court Coordination:**

* Establish procedural clarity between **matrimonial disputes** (Family Courts) and **civil torts** (District Courts).

**4. Judicial Caution in Expansion:**

* Courts should interpret AoA narrowly, ensuring it doesn’t revive **patriarchal notions** or **moral policing**.
* Compensation should be based on *tangible harm* (mental distress, reputation loss), not moral judgment.

**5. Promote Mediation and Counselling:**

* Encourage **restorative justice** methods like counselling before litigation, preserving dignity for all parties.

---

✅ **Summary Insight:**
The *Shelly Mahajan v. Bhanushree Bahl* ruling marks a **historic revival of Alienation of Affection (AoA)** — allowing spouses to seek **civil damages** from third parties who maliciously disrupt their marriage. It reflects the judiciary’s attempt to reconcile **privacy rights with marital integrity**, while reintroducing a rarely tested common law concept into Indian jurisprudence. The ruling underscores that **decriminalisation of adultery does not equate to social impunity** — marital bonds still enjoy civil protection.
