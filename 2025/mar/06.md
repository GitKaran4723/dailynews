# U.S. will impose reciprocal tariffs from April 2: Trump

This statement by former U.S. President Donald Trump, criticizing India and other countries for imposing high tariffs and announcing **reciprocal tariffs**, can be analyzed from the perspective of **international trade relations**, **bilateral ties**, and **global economic stability**. Here's a structured, detailed analysis suitable for UPSC-level understanding:

---

## **Contextual Background:**

### What are Tariffs?
- **Tariffs** are taxes imposed by governments on imported goods to protect domestic industries or generate revenue.
- India traditionally imposes higher tariffs on certain goods to safeguard its **infant industries**, promote **Make in India**, and address trade deficits.

### U.S.-India Trade Relations:
- The U.S. has often raised concerns about India's **protective tariff policies**.
- India, on the other hand, has defended its tariffs citing its status as a **developing economy** that requires protection for local industries.

---

## **How can Trump's criticism and reciprocal tariffs be seen?**

### 1. **From the Perspective of Trade Protectionism:**
- Trump’s remarks align with his larger **“America First”** policy, focusing on reducing trade deficits and promoting U.S. manufacturing.
- Reciprocal tariffs reflect a **protectionist stance**, attempting to level the playing field when other countries impose higher duties on American goods.
- This marks a shift **away from free trade** and multilateral agreements, toward **bilateral confrontations**.

### 2. **Impact on U.S.-India Relations:**
- Such remarks and actions can create **friction** in diplomatic ties.
- Trade disputes may overshadow cooperation in strategic areas like defense, counterterrorism, and technology.
- However, India and the U.S. have mechanisms like the **Trade Policy Forum (TPF)** to resolve such disputes diplomatically.

### 3. **Global Trade System Impact:**
- These actions undermine the **World Trade Organization (WTO)** framework which seeks to resolve trade disputes multilaterally.
- Escalation of such tariffs can contribute to a **global trade war**, affecting global economic stability and growth.
- Developing countries like India may find themselves under pressure to reduce tariffs or face retaliatory measures.

---

## **Long-Term Implications:**

### **A. On India:**
1. **Pressure to Liberalize Tariffs:**
   - India may face increased pressure to reduce tariffs on American goods, impacting domestic sectors like agriculture and manufacturing.
   
2. **Impact on Exports:**
   - U.S. reciprocal tariffs could hurt Indian exports (e.g., textiles, pharmaceuticals, IT services), affecting employment and the trade balance.

3. **Need for Diversification:**
   - India may push to diversify export destinations and reduce dependency on the U.S. market.

4. **Reform Push:**
   - Could accelerate domestic reforms to make industries globally competitive rather than relying on protectionism.

---

### **B. On Global Trade Dynamics:**
1. **Rise in Bilateral Trade Conflicts:**
   - Other countries may follow the U.S. example, leading to more **tit-for-tat tariffs** and destabilization of global trade norms.
   
2. **Weakening of WTO:**
   - Growing preference for unilateral actions may reduce the relevance of **multilateral dispute resolution mechanisms**.

3. **Shift in Alliances:**
   - Countries may seek new trade blocs and agreements, reshaping global trade architecture (e.g., **RCEP**, **EU partnerships**).

---

### **C. On the U.S.:**
1. **Short-term Gains, Long-term Risks:**
   - While protecting certain industries, reciprocal tariffs can lead to higher costs for consumers and retaliatory measures from trade partners.
   
2. **Loss of Leadership:**
   - By undermining global trade rules, the U.S. risks its leadership position in setting the agenda for global trade.

---

## **Conclusion:**
Trump's remarks and policies on reciprocal tariffs reflect a broader global shift towards **economic nationalism** and **protectionism**. For India, while such pressures challenge its trade policies, they also provide an opportunity to:
- Strengthen domestic competitiveness,
- Diversify its trade portfolio, and
- Engage diplomatically to preserve stable trade relations.

In the long run, sustained global trade tensions could undermine the principles of **free trade**, impact **global growth**, and necessitate a recalibration of **India’s trade and economic policies** to safeguard national interests while engaging with the global economy.

> Former U.S. President Donald Trump criticized India's high tariffs, calling them "very unfair," and announced reciprocal tariffs, reflecting a protectionist approach under his "America First" policy. This move strained U.S.-India trade relations, risking higher duties on Indian exports and pressuring India to reduce tariffs. Long-term implications include potential disruptions in global trade, weakening of the WTO framework, and increased bilateral trade conflicts. For India, this highlights the need to diversify exports, enhance domestic competitiveness, and pursue diplomatic solutions. Such actions mark a global shift towards economic nationalism, challenging the stability of international trade systems.

# Eggs six days a week have boosted attendance, says DSEL

This is a very important and insightful question, especially relevant for **social issues and governance** in the context of UPSC preparation. Let’s break it down comprehensively.

---

## **Context**  
The Department of School Education and Literacy (DSEL) observed that providing **eggs six days a week** in **mid-day meals (MDM)** has increased school attendance. Such initiatives are aimed at addressing **malnutrition** and encouraging **school enrolment and retention**, particularly in underprivileged areas.

---

## **Is this the correct policy?**

### **Yes, from a nutritional and short-term attendance perspective:**
- **Malnutrition** is a severe problem in India, especially among children from marginalized backgrounds.
- Eggs are **rich in protein** and **affordable**, helping combat **stunting, anemia**, and **wasting**.
- Mid-day meals have historically been a **key driver of attendance**, particularly for children from poor families who may otherwise not receive proper nutrition at home.
- For children facing **food insecurity**, the promise of a healthy meal is a strong motivator to come to school.

---

## **Why does this happen (children coming for food, not studies)?**

### **Root Causes:**
1. **Poverty and Hunger:** For many families, school meals are the only assured meal for their children.
2. **Quality of Education:** Poor infrastructure, absent teachers, and outdated pedagogy make classrooms unattractive.
3. **Parental Motivation:** In marginalized communities, education may not always be seen as immediately valuable compared to work or chores.
4. **First-generation learners:** Many students lack support at home, reducing engagement with academics.
5. **Inequity and Social Issues:** Discrimination (like caste bias) and neglect can demotivate learning.

---

## **Has anything changed over the years?**

### **Positive Changes:**
- MDM has improved **nutrition indicators** in many regions.
- Attendance, particularly in primary grades, has improved.
- School enrolments have risen, especially among **girls** and **weaker sections**.
- MDM ensures schools remain connected to communities, fostering accountability.

### **But…**

- **Learning outcomes remain poor.** According to ASER reports, many children in Class 5 still cannot read basic Class 2-level texts or perform simple arithmetic.
- **Attendance spikes during meals** but does not always translate into **active learning**.
- **Dropouts** increase after mid-day meal dependency ends (post-primary classes).
- **Teachers** sometimes focus more on meal logistics than teaching.

---

## **Is this true empowerment?**

### **No, not entirely.**
Providing food addresses **physical needs** (nutrition, hunger), but **empowerment** comes from **knowledge, skills, and confidence** built through **quality education**. 

If students come only for food but leave without learning, it becomes a **welfare scheme**, not an **empowerment program**.  
True empowerment requires:
- Quality teachers.
- Engaging curricula.
- Supportive learning environments.
- Monitoring and evaluation of **learning outcomes**, not just attendance.

---

## **What should India do beyond mid-day meals?**

| **Focus Area**       | **Actions Needed**                        |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Quality Teaching     | Training, motivation, accountability      |
| Curriculum Reform    | Localized, interactive, skill-based      |
| Community Involvement| Awareness among parents, local bodies    |
| Infrastructure       | Safe, digital, and well-equipped schools |
| Evaluation           | Shift from enrolment-based to learning-based assessments |

---

## **Conclusion**  
The **egg policy** is helpful **to bring children to school and fight malnutrition**, which are essential steps. However, **attendance without learning is incomplete empowerment**. India needs to **complement MDM with serious educational reforms** focused on **quality, inclusivity, and outcomes**. Otherwise, we risk running a large-scale feeding program **without transforming futures**.

> Providing eggs six days a week under the mid-day meal scheme has improved school attendance by addressing child malnutrition and hunger. However, this policy mainly attracts children for food, not learning, reflecting deep issues like poverty, poor teaching quality, and lack of community awareness. While mid-day meals ensure enrolment and nutritional support, they haven't significantly improved learning outcomes, with many students still lacking basic skills. True empowerment needs quality education, trained teachers, better infrastructure, and community involvement. Without these, such policies risk becoming welfare schemes focused on attendance rather than tools for real educational transformation.

# Warriors of hope

### **Analysis of the ASHA Worker System and the Need for Reform**

#### **Introduction**
Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) were introduced in **2005 under the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM)** to serve as a crucial link between rural communities and the public healthcare system. ASHA means **"hope"**, and these frontline workers have become the backbone of rural health, delivering vital services across maternal care, child health, disease control, and sanitation. Today, **over 1 million ASHAs** operate across India, symbolizing community-based health empowerment.

---

#### **Role and Achievements of ASHAs**
ASHAs have evolved into **multi-functional health workers**, performing a diverse range of tasks:
- **Maternal and Child Health**: Ensuring institutional deliveries, antenatal check-ups, immunization support, and neonatal care.
- **Disease Surveillance**: Managing both **communicable** and **non-communicable diseases**, including neglected tropical diseases.
- **Community Mobilization**: Promoting hygiene, sanitation, nutrition, and public health awareness.
- **Data Collection**: Maintaining crucial records like **births, deaths**, and health statistics.
- **COVID-19 Response**: Played an extraordinary role in tracking, awareness, vaccination drives, and community trust-building during the pandemic, gaining global recognition.

**International Acknowledgement**: Their contribution was honored through the **WHO Director-General’s Global Health Leaders Award (2022)**, underlining their critical impact on public health.

---

#### **Key Issues and Challenges**
Despite their monumental contributions, ASHA workers face structural and systemic problems:

##### 1. **Volunteer Status:**
- ASHAs are officially **classified as volunteers**, not regular government employees.
- Their earnings depend on a small **fixed honorarium** and **incentive-based payments** for task completion, such as escorting a woman for institutional delivery.
- Typical monthly income ranges between **₹5,000 and ₹15,000**, which is insufficient given the workload.

##### 2. **Work Burden and Conditions:**
- Long working hours and **excessive travel** across rural areas.
- Exposure to health risks without adequate safety measures.
- Personal health and well-being often neglected.
- Frequent lack of adequate **rest, nutrition, and social security**.

##### 3. **Lack of Legal and Employment Protections:**
- No status as permanent government employees.
- Limited **social security benefits** (accident and death insurance were introduced in 2018, but broader coverage is lacking).
- Subject to wage delays and inconsistent payments across different states.

##### 4. **Protests and Demands:**
- Regular protests for **better pay, regularization of services**, and **worker rights**.
- Demands include being recognized as **formal employees**, access to pensions, health benefits, and parity with other government health staff like Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs).

---

#### **Critical Analysis**
##### **Structural Flaws:**
The root problem lies in the conceptualization of ASHAs as **volunteers**, which made them expendable and inexpensive labor while avoiding the costs and responsibilities of formal employment. Their ever-expanding responsibilities have far outgrown the "volunteer" model.

##### **Gendered Nature of Exploitation:**
ASHAs, mostly **women**, face systemic undervaluation of their labor, reflecting broader societal tendencies to undercompensate women's work, particularly in care sectors.

##### **Economic Implications:**
Low wages contribute to **economic insecurity** among ASHA families, which in turn can affect their performance and motivation, compromising public health delivery.

##### **Equity and Justice:**
Considering ASHAs are the **frontline defense** in rural healthcare, the current system is inequitable and exploitative. Their roles have become **indispensable** to the functioning of India’s health system.

---

#### **Way Forward**
1. **Recognition as Government Employees**:
   - Regularize ASHA positions with clear employment terms.
   - Offer **fixed salaries with incentives** as additional bonuses, not substitutes for pay.

2. **Social Security and Welfare**:
   - Comprehensive health insurance.
   - Pensions and retirement benefits.
   - Paid leave and rest periods.

3. **Capacity Building and Support**:
   - Skill development programs.
   - Psychological support, considering the emotional toll of health crises like COVID-19.
   - Infrastructure support (transport, communication tools).

4. **Gender-sensitive Policies**:
   - Acknowledge the double burden of unpaid domestic work and professional responsibilities.
   - Ensure workplace dignity and protection from exploitation or harassment.

5. **Fair and Timely Compensation**:
   - Transparent payment systems.
   - Eliminate wage delays and discrepancies between states.

---

#### **Conclusion**
ASHAs symbolize the **"hope"** of India’s rural health system, but hope alone cannot sustain them. Two decades after their inception, it is imperative that the government moves beyond token gestures and awards, and delivers **structural reforms** that ensure dignity, security, and fair compensation for these health warriors. Transforming ASHAs from **volunteers to empowered public health employees** is essential for strengthening both **public health outcomes** and **social justice** in India.

> ASHAs, introduced in 2005 under the National Rural Health Mission, serve as the backbone of rural healthcare, ensuring maternal care, disease control, and hygiene promotion. Despite their critical role, they remain classified as **volunteers**, receiving meager, incentive-based wages (₹5,000–₹15,000 per month). They face long hours, health risks, and financial insecurity, leading to frequent protests. Recognized globally, including by WHO, ASHAs deserve **formal employment, fair wages, social security, and workplace protections**. The government must **regularize their status, provide fixed salaries, and ensure comprehensive welfare benefits** to uphold their dignity and strengthen India's public health system.

# Over-centralisation threatens federal health policy

### **Over-Centralisation Threatens Federal Health Policy**

India's federal structure is based on a delicate balance of power between the Union and the States. Health, as per the **Seventh Schedule of the Indian Constitution**, is a **State subject**, meaning State governments are primarily responsible for public health and sanitation. However, in practice, especially in recent years, there has been increasing **centralisation of health policy**, where the Union government is taking greater control over areas traditionally handled by the States. While central support and coordination are necessary in certain areas, over-centralisation can undermine India's health governance and weaken the very principles of **cooperative federalism**.

---

### **Understanding Over-Centralisation in Health Policy**

Over-centralisation in health refers to excessive decision-making power being concentrated at the **Union level**, limiting the flexibility and autonomy of State governments. This trend is evident in several areas:

1. **One-size-fits-all Schemes**: Centrally sponsored schemes like **Ayushman Bharat** and **National Health Mission (NHM)** come with pre-defined structures, targets, and funding rules, often without accommodating the diverse needs of States.

2. **Funding Control**: The Centre controls large portions of public health financing. States rely heavily on central grants, which often come with strict guidelines, leaving little room for innovation.

3. **Policy Dominance**: Key health policy directions, resource allocation, and program designs are increasingly dictated by the Centre, sidelining State-specific concerns.

4. **Pandemic Response**: During **COVID-19**, decision-making was highly centralised, with limited State flexibility, even though the pandemic impact varied significantly across regions.

---

### **Why is Over-Centralisation a Threat?**

#### 1. **India’s Health Diversity**
Health challenges vary widely across States due to differences in disease burden, infrastructure, geography, and demographics. For example:
- Kerala focuses on lifestyle diseases.
- Bihar still struggles with basic immunization and maternal health.
A centralised policy cannot efficiently address such diversity.

#### 2. **Erosion of Local Accountability**
When States merely implement centrally designed schemes, local innovation and accountability decline. States become **executors**, not **designers**, of health policy.

#### 3. **Resource Misallocation**
Uniform guidelines can cause resources to be diverted to areas that may not be State priorities. States with advanced health systems might be forced to implement redundant programs.

#### 4. **Weakened Federal Spirit**
Over-centralisation contradicts the spirit of **cooperative federalism**, undermining trust between Union and State governments and reducing collaborative policymaking.

---

### **The Way Forward**

- **Strengthen Fiscal Federalism**: Provide untied funds that States can use according to their priorities.
- **State-led Innovations**: Encourage local health innovations tailored to specific needs, like Tamil Nadu’s model of public health delivery.
- **Co-Design of Programs**: National schemes should involve States from the planning stage, ensuring flexibility and adaptability.
- **Capacity Building**: Enhance technical and administrative capacity at the State level to manage health systems independently.

---

### **Conclusion**

Health policy in India cannot thrive through centralisation alone. While national-level coordination is essential for setting broad goals and standards, meaningful health outcomes require **State autonomy, local adaptation, and community participation**. Preserving the federal nature of health governance is crucial not only for the effective delivery of services but also for upholding the constitutional balance of power. Over-centralisation, if unchecked, risks creating a rigid, unresponsive health system that fails to meet the diverse needs of India's population.

> Over-centralisation in India’s health policy threatens the federal structure, as health is a State subject requiring localized solutions. Increasing Union control through schemes like Ayushman Bharat and the National Health Mission limits States’ flexibility to address region-specific health challenges. Central dominance in funding, policy design, and pandemic response has reduced State innovation and accountability. Uniform programs often misallocate resources and weaken cooperative federalism. To ensure effective health outcomes, India must promote fiscal decentralization, encourage State-led innovations, and involve States in policy design. A balanced, collaborative approach is essential for a responsive and inclusive public health system.
