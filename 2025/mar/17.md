# 31 killed in U.S. strikes on Yemen; Houthis hit back

The recent U.S. strikes against Yemen’s Houthis will have significant geopolitical and economic implications, affecting global trade, energy security, and regional stability. Below is a structured analysis of the impact on the world and India:

---

### **1. Global Impact**
#### **(a) Escalation of Regional Tensions**
- The attack signals heightened U.S. involvement in the Middle East, increasing tensions between the U.S. and Iran, which backs the Houthis.
- It could provoke retaliatory actions from Iran or Iranian-backed militias in Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon, further destabilizing the region.

#### **(b) Disruptions to Global Trade**
- The Red Sea is a crucial shipping route, and continued Houthi attacks could force global shipping companies to reroute their vessels around Africa via the Cape of Good Hope, increasing transportation costs and delays.
- This could lead to inflationary pressures on goods transported via maritime trade, affecting supply chains globally.

#### **(c) Energy Price Volatility**
- Yemen is located near the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, through which about **10% of global oil trade** passes.
- If the situation escalates, oil supplies could be disrupted, leading to price spikes in crude oil and affecting energy-dependent economies.

#### **(d) U.S. Policy and Global Alliances**
- The strikes indicate a continuation of aggressive U.S. policies in the Middle East, potentially straining relations with regional allies like Saudi Arabia and the UAE.
- It could also impact diplomatic efforts for ceasefire talks in Yemen, affecting humanitarian conditions in the war-torn country.

---

### **2. Impact on India**
#### **(a) Energy Security Concerns**
- India **imports over 85% of its crude oil**, much of which comes from the Middle East. Any rise in oil prices due to Red Sea disruptions will increase India’s import bill.
- Higher fuel prices can contribute to inflation and economic instability in India.

#### **(b) Trade Route Disruptions**
- The Red Sea and Bab el-Mandeb Strait are **key maritime routes** for India’s exports to Europe and Africa. Prolonged tensions could force ships to take longer routes, raising freight costs and causing supply chain disruptions.
- India’s **major exports (textiles, machinery, pharmaceuticals)** to Europe could face delays, impacting revenue.

#### **(c) Strategic and Diplomatic Challenges**
- India maintains good relations with both the U.S. and Iran, and increased tensions between them could complicate India’s diplomatic balancing act.
- The situation could impact **India’s Chabahar port project in Iran**, which is crucial for regional connectivity and trade with Central Asia.

#### **(d) Safety of Indian Workers in the Middle East**
- India has a large **expatriate workforce (over 8 million)** in Gulf countries. Any escalation in regional instability could lead to security concerns and potential evacuations, as seen during previous conflicts.

#### **(e) Military and Security Implications**
- The **Indian Navy has already increased its presence** in the Arabian Sea to safeguard Indian merchant ships.
- Further escalation may require increased **naval deployment**, affecting defense strategy and resources.

---

### **Conclusion**
The U.S. strikes on Yemen’s Houthis have set the stage for greater instability in the Middle East. While the **immediate impact will be on regional security and global trade**, prolonged tensions could lead to **higher oil prices, disrupted trade routes, and diplomatic challenges** for India. India must **closely monitor** the situation and strengthen its naval presence in the region while ensuring alternative trade and energy strategies to mitigate risks.

> The U.S. strikes on Yemen’s Houthis escalate tensions in the Middle East, risking regional instability, higher oil prices, and global trade disruptions. The Red Sea crisis threatens key shipping routes, forcing longer, costlier detours. India, heavily dependent on Middle Eastern oil and trade via the Red Sea, faces rising energy costs and supply chain delays. Diplomatic complexities arise as India balances ties with the U.S. and Iran. The Indian Navy is increasing its presence to safeguard maritime interests. Prolonged conflict could impact India’s economy, expatriates in the Gulf, and strategic projects like Chabahar, requiring careful monitoring and contingency planning.

# The challenges of public health education in India

The decision by the United States to withdraw from the World Health Organization (WHO) and drastically reduce the scale of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is one that has sent shock waves through the aid and public health world. This move has disrupted essential health-care services in many low- and middle-income countries. However, India has been largely unaffected, as international aid accounts for just 1% of its total health expenditure. Nevertheless, the cessation of such funding threatens to further shrink an already constrained public health development sector, which relies heavily on international support. More importantly, this development directly impacts the public health job market, reducing opportunities for thousands who are pursuing their Master of Public Health (MPH) and similar postgraduate courses.

Public health plays a critical role in shaping a nation’s well-being and health-care delivery. The Constitution of India, through Article 47, underlines the state’s responsibility to improve public health care. Public health is a specialised field that requires specific knowledge and skills to effectively address people’s health needs. There is an urgent need for a dedicated workforce in India trained in public health, a fact that was very starkly realised during the COVID-19 pandemic. Beyond government systems, such a workforce is essential for civil society organisations, academic institutions, and research organisations engaged in public health.

### The evolution of training and jobs in India

Though the surge in public health education in India is relatively recent, its history dates to the colonial era. In the early days, public health was largely embedded within medical teaching. This narrow approach persisted despite the establishment of the All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, Kolkata in 1932 and the subsequent inclusion of preventive and social medicine — later known as community medicine — as an essential part of medical education. Specialists in community medicine, well-trained in public health provided public health services and met human resource needs in this field. However, their numbers were limited, and they were often engaged in medical teaching. Many students pursued MPH courses abroad in countries such as Australia, the European Union, the United Kingdom and the U.S. Yet, the supply of public health professionals remained constrained. Recognising the growing need and demand, MPH institutions and teaching expanded in India.

The number of institutions offering MPH and related courses in India has grown rapidly. Currently, over 100 institutions offer master’s level courses in public health, whereas in 2000, there was only one. This expansion coincided with the launch of the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) in 2005, which opened public health system roles to non-medical public health specialists. A wide range of institutions, from social science faculties to community medicine departments within medical institutions, have begun offering MPH courses. However, after an initial surge in demand, government recruitment for public health specialists plateaued, while the number of schools, programmes, and graduates continued to rise. As a result, securing jobs has become increasingly difficult for graduates.

Compounding this issue are challenges such as the lack of standardised training, insufficient practical learning opportunities, faculty shortages, and varied curricula that inadequately prepare students for real-world public health challenges. In addition, institutions offering public health courses are unevenly distributed, with large and populous States such as Assam, Bihar and Jharkhand, and many smaller and hilly States, having none or only a limited number of seats.

### Hurdles graduates face, issues in education

The foremost challenge is the mismatch between supply and demand, with limited and shrinking job opportunities for graduates. Today, entry-level positions in public health, such as research or programme assistants, attract a very high number of applications, with a significant proportion of candidates being eligible. The success rate remains exceptionally low, with only a few positions available. Moreover, the shrinking of public health roles and institutions within the public system has further limited job prospects. Efforts to establish public health management cadres in States have been hindered by multiple factors.

In recent times, the changing landscape of health care, marked by the growing dominance of the private sector in public health, further restricts employment opportunities. The private sector prioritises hospital and business management professionals over public health specialists. With limited opportunities in both the public and private sectors, the research and development sectors remain the primary employers for graduates. However, these sectors rely largely on foreign grants, and India is no longer one of the priority countries for such international funders. Similarly, the development sector is constrained by limited funding, which is expected to worsen further due to recent decisions in the U.S. The national research and health development funding remains in its early development and is significantly underfunded. Thus, the job scarcity for public health professionals continues and can exacerbate further.

Beyond job scarcity, there are concerns about the quality of MPH education. The rapid spread of public health schools has led to intense competition to attract students, often at the expense of compromising admission standards. Many students enrol in these courses without a clear understanding of the field or passion needed to thrive in this field. Further, public health faculty often lack adequate training and real-world experience. The absence of a standardised curriculum and clear outcome measures, despite the Health Ministry’s model course framework further exacerbates concerns. In India, MPH courses are currently not mandatorily regulated by any regulatory body. Neither the National Medical Commission (NMC) nor umbrella organisations such as the University Grants Commission (UGC) oversee MPH training. In the absence of these quality measures, the overall quality of graduates is also impacted.

### Approaches to consider

To address these challenges, a multi-pronged approach is required. The most urgent priority is to create public health jobs at all levels, from primary care to State and national health systems. In most developed countries with established public health education systems, governments are the largest employers of public health professionals. Similarly, establishing a dedicated public health cadre within State governments would be a significant step. This would not only create employment but also strengthen public health systems.

Next, a robust regulatory mechanism must be introduced by constituting a dedicated regulatory body or a specialised public health education division within existing regulatory agencies such as the NMC or UGC. This department, led by public health experts, should be responsible for setting curriculum standards and minimum training requirements while allowing room for institutional innovation, given that public health is a dynamic and evolving discipline. Moreover, public health training in all institutions must be closely integrated with practical learning opportunities within public health systems. There is a need to foster the growth of public health institutions in States where there are none or only a limited number. The emerging global situation calls for more national action and the building of local ecosystems for sustainable development in health.

> Public health education in India faces multiple challenges, including **lack of awareness, inadequate infrastructure, and insufficient funding**. Many rural areas suffer from **limited access to healthcare facilities and trained professionals**, leading to poor health literacy. Socioeconomic disparities, cultural beliefs, and misinformation hinder effective health campaigns. **Government initiatives like Ayushman Bharat** aim to improve awareness, but **low doctor-to-population ratios and weak implementation** remain obstacles. Digital health education and community engagement can help bridge gaps. Strengthening **school curricula, media outreach, and grassroots programs** is essential to enhance public health knowledge and promote preventive healthcare across diverse socio-economic and regional backgrounds.

# Tackling the problem of nutrition

While health was not a priority for Budget 2025, it seems that nutrition is. In the coming financial year, two Union government schemes will receive higher allocations — Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0. But will this fix India’s nutrition challenge?

Nutrition in India is not just about food insecurity, but also about dietary habits shaped by culture, caste, and gender relations. Only one aspect of the nutrition challenge receives most of the policy focus — malnutrition among women and children. Women outside of the reproductive age, men, and senior citizens rarely figure in national nutrition policy discussions. More importantly, we ignore diabetes, hypertension, and other lifestyle-induced non-communicable diseases which are really another manifestation of under nutrition. One type of nutrition deficiency is because some people just don’t have enough to eat and the other type is because people are not eating sufficient nutritionally rich food. The outcomes are damning in unique ways.

India has among the world’s highest share of malnourished children and anaemic women. According to the National Family Health Survey-5, 36% of children under five are stunted and a meagre 11% who are breastfed between the ages of 6 months and 23 months receive an adequate diet. Fifty-seven percent of women in the 15-49 age group are anaemic. There is a rise in the share of those with diabetes, hypertension, and other such lifestyle-diet induced non-communicable diseases (NCDs). 24% of women and 23% men in India are overweight or obese and 14% take medicines for diabetes.

### A comprehensive agenda

Poshan 2.0 and Saksham Anganwadi offer more of the same solutions — take-home rations, supplementary foods, tracking of severe and acute malnutrition cases, iron and folic acid tablets etc. With Poshan 2.0, there is additional focus on aspirational districts and the north-eastern region. But these schemes reinforce the idea that malnutrition is a problem only in certain parts of India and only in certain segments of the population. Instead, what we need is a comprehensive nutrition agenda in which nutrition is identified as a public health problem that impacts people across the social strata.

A comprehensive agenda would recognise the nutrition needs of different segments of the society. It must consist of: first, a clear identification of nutrition needs beyond reproductive and child health; second, a broad set of solutions, particularly rooted in the local food systems; and third, a clear identification of locally embedded facilities to deliver nutrition services. We need most work in identifying local institutional linkage for the agenda. Who will implement this in our neighbourhoods every day? The clear answer is: the health and wellness centres (HWCs).

At present, we provide supplementary nutrition for pregnant and lactating mothers and young children through take-home rations, iron and folic acid tablets for adolescent girls at Anganwadi centres (AWCs); and mid-day meals for children in schools. We need to systematically expand the nutrition-focused activities to other segments of the population and involve HCWs and ACWs. The mix of nutrients which goes in the take-home ration for poor women is relevant for pregnant women from all strata of society. Food items which use locally available low-cost, nutrient-dense produce need to be emphasised for the middle classes too, which consume sugar-laden, fibre-poor packaged goods.

For HWCs to implement this agenda, they need to be in sufficient numbers to cover the entire population. Each of them has to have a detailed set of nutrition services covering the entire catchment population. At present, the spread of HWCs is lopsided. Rural areas seem to have them in excess when compared to urban ones. And within rural areas, some areas have a higher concentration of HWCs.

Nutrition services in HWCs are limited. HWCs are supposed to provide nutrition advice to pregnant women and lactating women, adolescents and children, the elderly population, and those recuperating from disease, disaster and trauma. But these are not implemented consistently or systematically.

We also need dedicated staff to provide nutrition services at the HWCs. In the existing design, nutrition is a tiny part of the responsibilities of the multi-purpose worker.

### Factors for success

The success of the nutrition agenda will depend on two factors: engaging with local elites; and linking nutrition practices with local cuisines. Professor Prerna Singh at Brown University demonstrates in her research on small pox vaccination that there was significant variation in the uptake of vaccination during the 1950s among equally placed countries such as India and China. Some got their population vaccinated earlier and faster than others. Those that did were countries where the vaccination interventions were publicly owned by local elites and connected with local health practices and ideas.

India is a rapidly transforming society. We have to push further with the HWC approach of imagining health as wellbeing and not just an absence of illness. A locally owned, comprehensive nutrition agenda for all strata of society delivered by the primary health system is a first step in this direction.

> Tackling **nutrition problems** in India requires a multi-pronged approach addressing **malnutrition, micronutrient deficiencies, and obesity**. Issues stem from **poverty, lack of awareness, poor dietary habits, and food insecurity**. Government programs like **Poshan Abhiyaan, Mid-Day Meal Scheme, and ICDS** aim to improve nutrition, but challenges remain in implementation and outreach. Strengthening **nutritional education, promoting fortified foods, ensuring food security, and improving maternal and child nutrition** are key. Public-private partnerships, awareness campaigns, and community-based interventions can enhance impact. A **holistic approach integrating agriculture, health, and education** is essential to ensure sustainable improvements in India’s nutritional status and overall well-being.

# What is Elon Musk’s Starlink all about?

Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio have signed distribution pacts with SpaceX Corp.’s Starlink service to bring satellite internet access to India. The distribution pacts are a reversal from the telecom industry’s reluctance to quickly make the Starlink service available in India without auctions for the satellite airwaves.

### What is Starlink?

Starlink is a low-earth orbit constellation of over 7,000 satellites that provide internet access to users with ground terminals, which the Elon Musk-owned SpaceX is already selling in around 40 countries. The satellites constantly orbit the earth, blanketing practically its entire habitable surface with coverage, as long as a given terminal on the ground has visibility to the sky.

The service offers speeds of around 100 megabits per second, comparable with many home broadband connections. However, the “latency,” or the time it takes for a given data packet to travel between a user and terrestrial internet networks, is higher than wired broadband connections in offices and homes.

Satellites work in conjunction with ground stations on earth, which are physically connected to the internet like any other network and beam up connections wirelessly to satellites above them at any given point.

In India, Starlink may not be that useful in cities and towns with good 5G connectivity or wired broadband coverage, as local speeds and reliability will far exceed what a satellite link currently offers, even with technological advancements. However, in rural and remote areas where “terrestrial” networks have not penetrated deeply, Starlink can offer decent connectivity almost instantly.

### How much does Starlink cost?

There are two costs associated with Starlink: the user terminal — essentially a router — required to access the satellite network and the monthly access fee to stay connected. At present, a residential kit in parts of the U.S. costs $149, while a portable “roaming” kit costs $349. Import duty, GST and social welfare surcharges applicable on satellite equipment may push up the hardware price by around 30%.

Without any introductory pricing on the hardware, the equipment may cost anywhere between ₹17,000 and ₹40,000, not including shipping costs from the U.S., where it is developed and manufactured.

Besides this, unlimited residential and roaming plans range from $120-$165 in the U.S. It is not a given that this price will be any lower in India, as the cost to provide Starlink service is, by nature of the technology, the same everywhere on earth. Notably, in Bhutan, where Starlink launched this year, it is priced at 4,200 to 8,400 ngultrum, which may be an indication of the Indian price as well. The Bhutanese currency is pegged to the rupee at parity.

A higher-priced plan for users on the move, called “mobile priority” is available at 21,000 ngultrum (or therefore rupees) per month and offers priority access in case of network congestion.

### When will Starlink be available in India?

Starlink has faced several regulatory hurdles, the sharpest among them being the Indian government’s heavy scrutiny of internet services in general and a technology that could provide access anywhere in the country in particular.

SpaceX needs to obtain a Global Mobile Personal Communications by Satellite (GMPCS) authorisation under the Telecommunications Act, 2023. While this authorisation existed in a different form under the Telegraph Act, 1885, the updated rules under the new Act have yet to be published, and it is unclear if the government will issue such an authorisation under the previous law’s subordinate legislation, even though it remains technically in force.

As a part of this authorisation, SpaceX had to convince the Indian government to accept its contentions on revealing corporate ownership data, something it resisted on investor privacy grounds abroad. While reports suggest that this particular hurdle has been passed, the company still needs to obtain a security clearance from the Ministry of Home Affairs. It remains unclear if such a clearance has been obtained.

It is also uncertain whether the company’s ground stations in India — where the Telecom Act requires tapping equipment installed onsite to give law enforcement authorities access to the network, a requirement that exists for other internet networks as well — are currently operational.

Finally, Starlink also needs to be allotted wireless spectrum through which it can offer its services. The government has indicated that like other countries, it will not auction this spectrum, as these are narrow beams that can be shared with other providers, unlike the signals emitted by telecom towers on the ground. Telcos have — before tying up with Starlink this year — demanded that this spectrum be auctioned, something that would be a global first. Reliance Jio has commissioned legal opinions that state that auction is the only way to allot satellite spectrum, due to the Supreme Court’s 2012 judgment in the 2G scam case, where the top court held that all scarce natural resources must be allocated by auction.

It is unclear if these hurdles will be cleared on time. However, Mr. Musk’s ascendancy in the U.S. government, along with trade pressure from President Donald Trump’s administration, has boosted speculation that the government may facilitate Starlink’s entry in short order.

Aside from Airtel and Jio’s commercial distribution agreements, there have not been any official announcements on forward movement from a regulatory point of view.

> **Elon Musk's Starlink** is a satellite-based **internet service** developed by **SpaceX** to provide **high-speed, low-latency broadband** globally, especially in **remote and underserved areas**. It uses a **constellation of low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites** to deliver internet access, bypassing traditional infrastructure limitations.
