# India’s coal reliance rises to 79% in FY24 despite Centre’s renewable push
India's coal dependency has surged to 79% in FY2024, even as the nation strives to enhance its renewable energy capacity. This trend underscores the complex challenges India faces in balancing energy security, economic growth, and environmental sustainability.

**Impact of Increased Coal Dependence:**

1. **Environmental Concerns:**
   - **Air Pollution:** Elevated coal consumption contributes significantly to air pollution, leading to respiratory and cardiovascular health issues among the population.
   - **Greenhouse Gas Emissions:** Coal combustion is a major source of CO₂ emissions, exacerbating climate change and hindering India's commitments under the Paris Agreement.

2. **Economic Implications:**
   - **Import Expenditure:** Despite substantial domestic reserves, India imports a significant amount of coal, impacting foreign exchange reserves and trade balance.
   - **Energy Costs:** Fluctuations in global coal prices can affect domestic energy costs, influencing inflation and economic stability.

3. **Energy Security:**
   - **Supply Vulnerabilities:** Over-reliance on coal, especially imported varieties, exposes the energy sector to geopolitical risks and supply chain disruptions.

**Government Initiatives to Address Coal Dependence:**

1. **Renewable Energy Expansion:**
   - **National Solar Mission:** Launched in 2010 and revised in 2015, aiming for 100 GW of solar power by 2022, with a broader target of 450 GW from renewable sources by 2030.
   - **Wind Energy Development:** Promotion of wind power projects to diversify the renewable energy mix.

2. **Policy Frameworks:**
   - **National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC):** Introduced in 2008, encompassing eight missions focused on sustainable development and climate resilience.
   - **State Action Plans on Climate Change (SAPCC):** Encouraging states to develop localized strategies aligned with national objectives.

3. **Energy Efficiency Programs:**
   - **Perform, Achieve, and Trade (PAT) Scheme:** A market-based mechanism to enhance energy efficiency in energy-intensive industries.
   - **Renewable Energy Certificates (REC):** Facilitating compliance with renewable purchase obligations by obligated entities.

4. **Coal Sector Reforms:**
   - **Coal Gasification Initiatives:** Aiming to gasify 100 million tonnes of coal by 2030 to reduce emissions and diversify coal utilization.
   - **Coal Block Auctions:** Opening coal mining to private players to increase domestic production and reduce imports.

**Recommendations to Reduce Coal Dependency:**

1. **Accelerate Renewable Energy Deployment:**
   - **Infrastructure Investment:** Enhance grid infrastructure to integrate renewable energy sources effectively.
   - **Incentivization:** Provide financial incentives and subsidies to promote the adoption of renewable technologies.

2. **Diversify Energy Mix:**
   - **Nuclear Energy Expansion:** Pursue nuclear power projects to provide a stable and low-carbon energy source.
   - **Natural Gas Utilization:** Increase the share of natural gas as a transitional fuel towards a cleaner energy mix.

3. **Enhance Energy Efficiency:**
   - **Upgrading Power Plants:** Retrofitting existing coal-fired plants with advanced technologies to improve efficiency and reduce emissions.
   - **Demand-Side Management:** Implement programs to encourage energy conservation among consumers.

4. **Policy and Regulatory Measures:**
   - **Carbon Pricing:** Introduce carbon pricing mechanisms to internalize the environmental costs of coal usage.
   - **Stricter Emission Norms:** Enforce stringent emission standards for industries and power plants.

5. **Research and Development:**
   - **Innovative Technologies:** Invest in research for energy storage solutions, smart grids, and carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies.
   - **Skill Development:** Train the workforce in renewable energy technologies to support the transition.

**Conclusion:**

While coal continues to play a dominant role in India's energy landscape, a multifaceted approach involving policy reforms, technological advancements, and strategic investments is essential to transition towards a more sustainable and diversified energy future. Balancing economic growth with environmental stewardship will be pivotal in achieving long-term energy security and meeting international climate commitments.

# Is a revamped GST 2.0 on the cards?
In a report to Parliament, its Public Accounts Committee (PAC) has sought a comprehensive review of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) framework to eliminate “unnecessary procedures and requirements” that can complicate compliance. It called for a “revamped GST 2.0” to be considered after consultations with all stakeholders.

## What has it observed about GST compensation to States?

The PAC observed that the absence of the mandatory CAG audit of the Compensation Fund Account for more than six years has “adversely affected” release of compensation to States. For context, GST’s introduction back in 2017 had instilled fears among States about loss of fiscal autonomy and centralisation of all collections to the Union, particularly those housing heavy manufacturing units as Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, among others. The GST (Compensation to States) Act, 2017 was instituted to compensate States for this loss of revenue. About the present lack of audits, the committee observed that it was due to the CAG not receiving the relevant information of the accounts in the appropriate format containing the quantum to be paid and due thereafter, among other things. The PAC also critiqued the Ministry’s “lackadaisical” approach for not responding to the audit, seeking clarification on 2,447 inconsistencies that have kept a total of ₹32,577.73 crore in balance. This was based on an examination of 10,667 cases.

## What are some of the other problems?

There are issues regarding the taxation process, which is either delaying the inflow to the government, or tax refunds to businesses requiring working capital. The audit came across instances of incomplete tax refund (to businesses) owing to confusion over tax jurisdictions. The other significant part of the problem relates to cancellation of registrations. The GST Act provides that registrations cannot be cancelled without issuing a ‘show cause notice’ to the concerned entity and providing it “reasonable opportunity” to argue its defence. The committee noted that of the 14,998 cases where cancellations were done suo motu, notices were not issued in 6,353 cases. The Finance Ministry apprised the committee that this process has been automated. However, the committee said it was concerned about the alleged “lack of proper documentation” and the “effectiveness of the automated system”. Brijesh Kothary, partner at law firm Khaitan & Co, told The Hindu that taxpayers are not given an option to withdraw or edit the application for registration. “In some cases, the application for registration is rejected without providing clarity on the reason for such rejection,” he stated.

## What about filing and refunds?

With respect to filing and refunds, the committee said existing mechanisms are “inadequate”, pointing at prolonged waiting periods for refunds which could result in potential cash flow challenges to businesses. The Ministry, as per the report, indicated that efforts were being made to streamline the refund process. The committee has sought the refund processing system provide clearer timelines for processing claims and regular updates on their status. At the centre of all GST functions, such as filing, registrations and cancellations or tracking, is the quality of reference data to ease scrutiny. The committee highlighted concerns about manual records not being maintained and a poor documentation rigour. The Finance Ministry said that the ‘Antarang portal’ would help in streamlining the procedure.

## Who gets affected by such glitches?

The reported impact on micro, medium and small enterprises (MSMEs) and exporters is noteworthy. The committee expressed concerns about ensuing issues relating to exporters’ cash flow requirements and MSMEs due to “complexity” of GST norms. Delays in processing of refund claims for ITC and complexities with export-related documentation requirements can potentially create cash flow constraints. The committee thus underlined a need to simplify the overall regime, pointing out that ITC claims be processed within a specified timeframe at priority. The committee said a total of 19,730 cases entailing tax implications of about ₹1.45 lakh crore were pending for investigation as of March 2022. Mr. Kothary observed that most of these cases were pending for more than two years. “The government must expediate the handling of appeals and establishment of the GST Appellate Tribunal so as to reduce pendency of cases,” he stated.
