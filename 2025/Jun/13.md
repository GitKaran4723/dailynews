## **Iraq Congo Fever Outbreak**

---

### **1\. Basic Understanding**

* **Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF)** → Viral disease transmitted via:

  * **Tick bites** (especially **Hyalomma ticks**).

  * **Contact with infected animal blood** or **human bodily fluids**.

* Caused by **CCHF virus** → genus *Nairovirus*.

* Symptoms:

  * High fever.

  * Muscle pain.

  * Bleeding (hemorrhage).

* Case fatality rate → **10-40%**.

* Endemic in parts of **Africa, Eastern Europe, Middle East, Asia**.

---

### **2\. The News**

* Iraq reported a **surge in CCHF cases** in **June 2025**.

* Over **350 confirmed cases**; **more than 40 deaths**.

* Major outbreaks in **southern & central Iraq**.

* Linked to **livestock trade** and **poor vector control**.

* Eid al-Adha approaching → concern over **animal slaughter practices** increasing transmission risk.

* WHO assisting Iraq’s Ministry of Health with response.

---

### **3\. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Iraq’s Health Ministry**:

  * Distributed **personal protective equipment (PPE)** for healthcare workers.

  * Stepped up **tick control** measures on livestock.

* **WHO**:

  * Deployed **Rapid Response Teams**.

  * Supporting **surveillance** and **diagnostics**.

* Global health agencies monitoring risk of **regional spread**.

---

### **4\. Mains Relevance**

#### **Issues & Challenges**

* **Zoonotic diseases** increasing with:

  * Climate change → expanding **tick habitats**.

  * Human-wildlife-livestock interfaces growing.

* Weak **veterinary public health systems** in many countries.

* Cross-border spread risk → porous borders in Middle East.

* Need for **One Health** approach lacking in many national policies.

#### **Impacts**

* **Society**:

  * High public fear → affects livestock trade & livelihoods.

### **5\. Way Forward**

✅ Scale up **vector control** and safe **livestock management**.  
 ✅ Implement **public awareness** on safe animal handling.  
 ✅ Strengthen **surveillance systems** for zoonotic diseases.  
 ✅ Build **One Health** capacity → integrate **animal, human, and environmental health** responses.  
 ✅ Promote **international cooperation** — share data, coordinate cross-border responses.  
 ✅ Invest in **diagnostics & treatment research** for emerging zoonoses.
