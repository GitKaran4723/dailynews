# Sharp rise in women Maoists killed in operations in Chhattisgarh since 2024
---

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Maoists/Naxalites**: A left-wing extremist group in India, inspired by Maoist ideology, primarily active in central and eastern India. They aim to overthrow the state through armed rebellion.
* **Bastar Region**: A Maoist stronghold in Chhattisgarh known for tribal populations and dense forests, making it difficult for security forces to operate.
* **Bal Dasta**: Child combat groups allegedly formed by Maoists, often through coercion or indoctrination.
* **Security Operations**: Armed confrontations led by police and paramilitary forces aimed at eliminating Maoist influence.

### 2. **The News**

* Since **2024**, over **one-third of Maoist casualties in Chhattisgarh have been women**, a steep rise from previous years.
* **2024**: Out of 217 Maoists killed, 74 were women.
* **Till June 20, 2025**: 195 killed, 82 were women.
* **Past years (2019–2023)** saw far fewer casualties and women killed, highlighting a recent spike.
* The **Union Home Ministry** has set a target to end Maoism by **March 2026**, intensifying operations.
* The Ministry attributes high female participation to **forced recruitment, especially of girl children**, and **lack of real empowerment within Maoist ranks**.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **SAMADHAN Doctrine**: Comprehensive strategy to tackle Left Wing Extremism (LWE) through coordination, capacity building, and development.
* **Surrender and Rehabilitation Policy**: Offers incentives, vocational training, and financial aid to surrendered Maoists.
* **Security Modernisation**: Increased deployment of CRPF, specialized units like CoBRA, and use of UAVs in Maoist zones.
* **Civic Action Programme (CAP)**: Encourages police-public cooperation in LWE areas by providing basic amenities and trust-building.
* **Amendments to UAPA & Chhattisgarh Special Public Security Act**: To facilitate speedy trials and stronger anti-terror action.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### **Issues and Challenges**

* **Gendered Recruitment**: Women and girls are being disproportionately affected, pointing to gendered exploitation in insurgency.
* **Child Rights Violation**: Use of children in warfare (Bal Dastas) is a violation of UNCRC and Indian laws.
* **Human Shield Tactics**: Women being used as front-line casualties raises **ethical and legal concerns**.
* **Poor Rehabilitation Awareness**: Lack of effective implementation and reach of surrender policies among tribals.

#### **Impacts**

* **Societal**: Trauma and stigma for families of women Maoists; tribal mistrust toward the state may deepen.
* **Security**: Higher casualties among women may indicate increased desperation or strategic shifts within Maoist ranks.
* **Governance**: Shows both the aggressive push to eliminate Maoism and the **need for nuanced conflict resolution** approaches.

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Strengthen Rehabilitation Programs**: Proactively promote surrender with gender-sensitive counselling and reintegration plans.
2. **Focus on Tribal Education & Awareness**: Prevent forced recruitment by investing in education, awareness, and livelihood in LWE zones.
3. **Independent Monitoring**: Involve civil society and NHRC to ensure operations follow human rights protocols.
4. **De-radicalisation Campaigns**: Use former cadres and local influencers to counter Maoist narratives, especially among youth and women.
5. **Empower Local Governance (PESA, FRA)**: Make tribals stakeholders in governance to reduce alienation and Maoist appeal.

# KAMS vs. KSCPCR: Conflict Over School Inspections in Karnataka

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **KAMS**: The Associated Management of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka, an association of private school managements.
* **KSCPCR**: Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, a statutory body under the Commissions for Protection of Child Rights Act, 2005, mandated to ensure child rights are protected across the state.
* **NCPCR**: National Commission for Protection of Child Rights, the apex child rights body in India with the authority to investigate child rights violations across states.
* **Detention Policy**: As per RTE Act, children cannot be failed or detained in a class until Grade 8. Detention after that must follow proper rules.

### 2. **The News**

* **KAMS has lodged a complaint** with the **NCPCR** against **KSCPCR**, alleging harassment and unlawful inspections of private unaided schools.
* Accusations include:

  * Trespassing into classrooms without notice.
  * Sending teachers out and interacting with students behind closed doors.
  * Bringing police onto campuses without due process.
  * Forcing fee refunds in specific cases like student detention.
* KAMS demands suspension of KSCPCR officials and an independent NCPCR-led probe.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Institutional Framework**

* **Commissions for Protection of Child Rights Act, 2005**: Provides for both state and national commissions with powers to inspect, recommend action, and protect children’s rights.
* **Right to Education Act, 2009**: Prohibits arbitrary detention and mandates child-friendly environments; commissions are empowered to ensure compliance.
* **Private School Regulations**: State-specific rules exist, and both Education Departments and child rights bodies can inspect institutions under certain conditions.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### **Issues and Challenges**

* **Jurisdictional Conflict**: Raises questions about the scope of powers of KSCPCR and the accountability of quasi-judicial bodies.
* **School Autonomy vs. Child Rights**: Balancing institutional independence with child protection responsibilities is a legal and ethical challenge.
* **Due Process**: Entry without notice and presence of police may violate norms of natural justice and institutional autonomy.
* **Private Sector Concerns**: Private unaided schools argue they’re being disproportionately targeted, affecting trust and cooperation with regulatory bodies.

#### **Impacts**

* **Legal Precedents**: May lead to review of powers and protocols followed by State Commissions across India.
* **Policy Review**: Could trigger reforms to create a more balanced inspection mechanism.
* **Public Perception**: Erodes trust between school authorities and rights commissions, potentially impacting children if not resolved sensitively.

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Clear Protocols for Inspections**: NCPCR should issue detailed SOPs ensuring inspections are child-sensitive, legal, and transparent.
2. **Dialogue Mechanism**: Create a state-level coordination committee including KSCPCR, school associations, and education officials.
3. **Training for Commission Officials**: Emphasize lawful conduct, data privacy, and school rights in their interactions.
4. **Review of Complaint Process**: Ensure fair hearings for both schools and rights commissions when disputes arise.
5. **Student-Centric Reforms**: Keep the child’s best interests at the center — ensuring rights are protected without undermining educational institutions.

# The sorry state of South Asian economic integration
---

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **SAARC**: South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, established to promote peace and prosperity among South Asian countries.
* **SAFTA**: South Asian Free Trade Area Agreement (2006), aimed at reducing trade barriers among SAARC members.
* **Intraregional Trade**: Trade between countries within the same region.
* **Trade-to-GDP Ratio**: Measures how much of a country’s economy is dependent on international trade.
* **Trade Costs**: Expenses involved in cross-border trade (tariffs, time, infrastructure, etc.).
* **Gravity Model of Trade**: A model predicting bilateral trade flows based on economic size and distance.

### 2. **The News**

* Two events — **reciprocal tariffs by the U.S. (Trump administration)** and the **terror attack in Pahalgam** — have exposed the **fragility of India’s economic and national security**.
* The events highlight the deep **interconnection between security and economic stability**.
* Despite SAFTA, **South Asia has among the lowest levels of intraregional trade globally**, at just **5-7%** of total trade — far lower than EU (45%), ASEAN (22%), and NAFTA (25%).
* Trade among SAARC nations is about **\$23 billion**, far below its **\$67 billion potential** and **\$172 billion projected capacity**.
* Trade costs within South Asia are **higher (114%)** than those with the U.S. (109%), despite geographical proximity.
* **India-Pakistan trade** fell sharply from **\$2.41 billion (2018)** to **\$1.2 billion (2024)** due to geopolitical tensions.
* South Asia’s **trade-to-GDP ratio** fell from **47.3% (2022)** to **42.9% (2024)**, while the **trade deficit widened** to **\$339 billion in 2022**.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **SAFTA (2006)**: Aimed at lowering tariffs, but undermined by political conflicts and weak implementation.
* **BBIN Initiative (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal)**: Sub-regional effort for connectivity and trade.
* **India’s Neighbourhood First Policy**: Seeks stronger economic and diplomatic ties with neighbours.
* **India-Sri Lanka and India-Bangladesh Bilateral FTAs**: Complement SAFTA, but are under-utilized.
* **Look East/Act East Policy**: Promotes connectivity with ASEAN over SAARC due to lesser regional friction.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### **Issues and Challenges**

* **High Trade Costs**: Make intraregional trade unattractive despite proximity.
* **Security Threats**: Terrorism and insurgency disrupt trade routes and trust.
* **Bilateral Conflicts**: India-Pakistan tensions, border disputes, and nationalism hinder cooperation.
* **Weak Regional Institutions**: SAARC is largely inactive; consensus-building is poor.
* **Lack of Political Will**: National interests and internal politics override regional commitments.

#### **Impacts**

* **Economic Underperformance**: Vast untapped trade and investment potential; missed opportunities in services, tourism, and digital economy.
* **National Security Risks**: Economic instability and unemployment in border areas can fuel extremism.
* **Global Marginalization**: South Asia lags behind ASEAN, EU, and NAFTA in regional cooperation, reducing global competitiveness.

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Depoliticize Trade**: De-link trade from geopolitical disputes wherever possible, especially humanitarian and low-sensitivity goods.
2. **Revive SAARC with Focused Agenda**: Prioritize economic cooperation, connectivity, and disaster management over contentious political issues.
3. **Sub-Regional Groupings**: Use platforms like **BBIN and BIMSTEC** as intermediate steps toward deeper regional integration.
4. **Improve Infrastructure and Digital Trade**: Invest in cross-border transport, digitization of customs, and energy grids.
5. **Confidence-Building Measures (CBMs)**: People-to-people exchanges, academic and cultural collaborations to rebuild trust.
6. **Promote Trade in Services and Informal Sectors**: Encourage tourism, education, and healthcare collaboration as less-politicized sectors.

## Inflation Declines but Unemployment and Growth Slowdown Persist: Rethinking RBI's Role
---

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Inflation**: Rise in prices of goods and services over time. In India, it is often tracked using the **Consumer Price Index (CPI)**.
* **Repo Rate**: The rate at which the RBI lends to commercial banks; key tool of monetary policy to control inflation.
* **Unemployment Rate**: Percentage of people in the labor force who are willing to work but unable to find jobs.
* **Inflation Targeting**: A monetary policy strategy where the central bank aims to keep inflation within a prescribed range (India’s target: 4% ±2%).
* **GDP Growth Rate**: Measures how fast the economy is growing. A slowdown reflects reduced income, jobs, and investment.

### 2. **The News**

* In **May 2025**, **inflation fell to 2.8%** from 3.2% in April — **well below the RBI’s upper target limit of 6%**.
* However, **unemployment rose to 5.8%**, and **GDP growth fell** from 9.2% in 2023–24 to **6.5% in 2024–25**.
* Economists highlight that while **media celebrated RBI’s success**, the **real driver of reduced inflation** was the sharp **rise in agricultural output**, not monetary policy.
* Growth slowdown was widespread — all sectors except **agriculture and public administration** saw deceleration.
* The **sharp fall in food inflation** (from 11% in Oct 2024 to <1% in May 2025) helped pull down overall CPI.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Monetary Policy Framework Agreement (2016)**: Legally mandates RBI to maintain inflation between 2–6%.
* **Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS)**: Measures unemployment levels; latest data shows rising joblessness.
* **Agriculture sector push**: Possible role of MSP reforms, irrigation schemes, and increased public procurement in boosting food production.
* **Atmanirbhar Bharat & PM-KISAN**: Broader economic support may have indirectly helped stabilize rural demand and output.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### **Issues and Challenges**

* **Monetary Policy Limitations**: Evidence suggests **repo rate hikes did not cause the inflation decline**; food supply dynamics played a larger role.
* **Jobless Growth**: Declining growth and rising unemployment signal that economic expansion isn’t translating into adequate job creation.
* **Misplaced Celebrations**: Media and policy narratives overly focus on inflation, ignoring employment and real output issues.
* **Distributional Concerns**: Disinflation benefits those with jobs (through higher purchasing power), but **does nothing for the unemployed**.

#### **Impacts**

* **Growth-Employment Disconnect**: Even in years of high growth (like 2023–24), employment didn’t rise proportionally, indicating structural issues.
* **Monetary vs Structural Approach**: Structural inflation driven by food prices and supply gaps may not respond well to demand contraction tools like repo rate changes.
* **Policy Credibility**: If RBI follows inflation rather than steering it (as recent signals suggest), it weakens the credibility of inflation targeting.

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Shift to Dual Mandate**: RBI should also target **employment or output stability**, not just inflation, as seen in the U.S. Federal Reserve model.
2. **Enhance Agricultural Resilience**: Improve cold storage, logistics, and crop diversification to stabilize food prices sustainably.
3. **Better Job Monitoring**: Institutionalize monthly employment data and include it in economic policymaking and RBI briefings.
4. **Recalibrate Monetary Policy**: Recognize limited impact of repo rates on supply-side inflation; shift toward **fiscal coordination and sectoral reforms**.
5. **Strengthen Demand**: Encourage public investment in infrastructure, rural employment (like MGNREGS), and SME credit to revive jobs and demand.
