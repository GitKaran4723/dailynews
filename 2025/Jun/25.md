---

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Finance Commission**: A constitutional body (Article 280) formed every 5 years to recommend how financial resources are distributed between the Centre and States.
* **Tax Devolution**: The share of central taxes allocated to states based on factors like population, income distance, area, and forest cover.

# A reset in West Asia, a ‘de-escalation’ for the world
---

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **West Asia** refers to the Middle East region, including countries like Iran, Iraq, Israel, Saudi Arabia, UAE, etc.
* **Iran Nuclear Issue**: Western powers, especially the U.S. and Israel, view Iran’s nuclear program as a major threat, despite Iran’s insistence on peaceful intent.
* **Abraham Accords**: Agreements between Israel and several Arab nations (e.g., UAE, Bahrain) to normalize relations, marginalizing the Palestinian cause.
* **Proxy groups**: Iran supports groups like Hezbollah (Lebanon), Hamas (Gaza), and Houthis (Yemen), which are seen as threats by Israel and Gulf nations.
* **“Eretz Israel”**: Refers to Israel’s biblical territorial aspirations from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea — implies annexation of Palestine.

### 2. **The News**

* **India’s official policy**: Supports a **two-state solution** for Palestine; has long advocated **peaceful resolution** in West Asia.
* International frameworks like the **NPT (Non-Proliferation Treaty)** and **UN Charter** on **sovereignty** and **non-aggression** remain largely ineffective amid global power politics.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

**Issues & Challenges**:

* **Collapse of global norms**: International law, territorial integrity, and sovereignty are ignored for strategic interests.
* **Rise of unilateralism**: U.S.-Israel axis unilaterally reshaping West Asia.
* **Destabilization risk**: Regime change attempts may lead to **Iraq/Libya-like collapse**, rise of terror groups.
