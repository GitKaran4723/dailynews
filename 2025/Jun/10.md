 ✅ Maintain **strict neutrality** of police & security forces.  
 ✅ Use **CBMs (confidence-building measures)** → community policing, joint peace committees.  
 ✅ Move towards **sustainable political settlement** → review governance structures (Sixth Schedule/other frameworks).  
 ✅ Address **root socio-economic causes** → tribal grievances, valley-hill disparities.  
 ✅ Use **controlled internet access** → allow essential services while curbing hate content.

---

✅ **Prelims Focus:**

* Suspension of Operations (SoO) → tripartite ceasefire framework.

* Sixth Schedule → Autonomous governance for hill areas (not fully implemented in Manipur).

* NH-2 & NH-37 → critical highways to Imphal Valley.

* Art. 355 → Centre’s internal security duty.

## **SC Refuses Urgent Hearing on Tamil Nadu Plea Over Centre Halting Education Funds**

### **1\. Basic Understanding**

* **Centre-State Financial Relations:**

  * **Article 282:** Both Union & States can spend on any public purpose.

  * **Article 275, 280:** Financial devolution through Finance Commission.

  * **Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS):** Shared funding model (Centre-State); key driver for sectors like education & health.

  * States often depend on **CSS funds** for flagship programmes (e.g. Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan).

* **Judicial Review:**

  * SC has power under **Article 32** & **226** to review fund stoppage if violates **Constitutional obligations** (e.g. Right to Education under Art. 21A).

### **2\. The News**

* **Tamil Nadu Govt** approached **SC** stating that **Centre had halted release of education funds** under various CSS.

* Allegation: Funds withheld as **political retaliation** after State opposed certain Central policies.

* SC refused **urgent listing**; said will consider in regular course.

* TN argued that fund stoppage violates **Right to Education** & disrupts school programmes.

* Highlights rising tensions in **Centre-State fiscal relations**.

### **3\. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan:** CSS for universalising school education (pre-primary to senior secondary).

* **PM Poshan (Mid-Day Meal Scheme):** CSS for school nutrition.

* **NEP 2020:** Pushes States to adopt certain curricular reforms (TN has objections).

* Recent debates:

  * Some States alleging **conditional fund release** → affects federal balance.

  * Push for **greater untied grants** via Finance Commission instead of CSS.

* Constitutional basis:

  * Art. 21A → Right to free & compulsory education (6-14 yrs).

  * Art. 280 → Finance Commission’s role.

  * Art. 282 → Grants-in-aid flexibility.

### **4\. Mains Relevance**

**Issues and Challenges:**

* Perceived **political bias** in CSS fund release.

* Fiscal dependency of States on Union Govt.

* Lack of transparency in **fund allocation criteria**.

* Threat to **Constitutional guarantees** (like RTE) if funds stopped arbitrarily.

* Rising **Centre-State friction** → governance paralysis risk.

**Impact:**

* **Society:**

  * School children affected → potential mid-day meal disruption, halted infrastructure works.

  * Teacher morale hit due to funding uncertainty.

* **Economy:**

  * State education budgets stressed → forced to cut other programmes.

* **Polity:**

  * Strains **federal structure** → Article 1 declares India as a Union of States.

  * Adds fuel to debates on **cooperative vs confrontational federalism**.

* **Governance:**

  * Undermines **States’ ability** to deliver **Constitutionally mandated services**.

* **Ethical/Governance:**

  * Violates **principle of fiscal justice** if done for political reasons.

  * Children’s rights should not become **collateral in Centre-State tussles**.

### **5\. Way Forward**

✅ Urgent need for **transparent fund release mechanisms** under CSS.  
 ✅ Create **independent oversight body** (Finance Commission/Inter-State Council) to monitor CSS fund flow.  
 ✅ Strengthen **Finance Commission route** for untied grants → reduces Centre’s discretionary power.  
 ✅ Clarify **Centre-State roles** under NEP 2020 → respect States’ education priorities.  
 ✅ Foster **cooperative federalism** through regular Centre-State dialogues.  
 ✅ Encourage **States to increase own education spending** → reduce dependency.  
 ✅ SC should give **early authoritative ruling** on Constitutional limits to fund stoppage.

---

✅ **Prelims Focus:**

* Art. 21A → Right to Education.

* Art. 275 → Grants-in-aid.

* Art. 282 → Grants for public purpose.

* Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan, PM Poshan → key education CSS.

* Finance Commission → role in fiscal devolution.
