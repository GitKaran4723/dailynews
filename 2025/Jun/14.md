### **2\. The News**

#### **Incident Details:**

* On **June 12, 2025**, **Air India Flight AI171** (Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner) crashed minutes after takeoff from Ahmedabad to London Gatwick.

* Only **1 passenger survived**; **first hull loss** globally of the Boeing 787\.

* Aircraft reached a **barometric altitude of 625 feet** before crashing into a building.

#### **Technical Analysis:**

* **Possible Causes**:

  * Bird ingestion causing **compressor stall** ‚Üí partial thrust loss.

  * FOD, similar to **Air France Concorde 2000 crash** ‚Äî debris on runway may have caused damage.

  * Landing gear remained **extended**, increasing drag and preventing proper climb.

  * Possible **training flight** scenario ‚Äî questions about control transfer between captain and copilot.

* **Environmental Factors**:

  * **Overgrown grass** near runway attracted birds.

  * Monsoon preparation protocols (mowing grass below 3 inches) were not followed.

* **Building Issue**:

  * Aircraft hit a **70-ft building** in takeoff funnel; shows failure of regulatory clearances near airports.

#### **Regulatory & Systemic Concerns:**

* DGCA **violated ICAO norms** by naming the pilots immediately.

* Historically, **after every major crash**, pilots are blamed while systemic flaws are ignored.

* Safety accountability in India‚Äôs aviation sector is deeply flawed ‚Äî **"rot starts at the top"**.

---

### **3\. Broader Aviation Safety Context**

#### **Pattern of Complacency:**

* Past crashes where **systemic reforms were ignored**:

  * **IC605 (1990)** Bangalore

  * **CD7412 (2000)** Patna

  * **IX-812 (2010)** Mangaluru

  * **IX1344 (2020)** Kozhikode

#### **Judicial Apathy:**

* **Supreme Court** dismissed a well-evidenced PIL post-Mangaluru crash ‚Äî handed back to MoCA.

* Weak **judicial oversight** over aviation regulatory lapses.

#### **Political Interference:**

* DGCA and AAI leadership often filled with **bureaucrats**, not aviation professionals.

* Appointment of **accident investigators** often politically influenced to ‚Äútoe the line‚Äù.

#### **Safety Culture Deficit:**

* India‚Äôs **fastest growing aviation market** ‚Üí safety culture has not kept pace.

* **No accountability** for systemic failures.

* Key roles at DGCA, AAI lack the **independent expertise** required to ensure ICAO-compliant safety governance.

---

### **4\. Government Interventions & Current Efforts**

* **DGCA Mandates**:

  * Flight Data Monitoring (FDM), Safety Management Systems (SMS) for airlines.

* **MoCA**:

  * National Civil Aviation Policy mentions safety but **implementation remains poor**.

* **Air India (Tata-owned)**:

  * Vihaan.AI roadmap ‚Äî created a Group Head of Safety, Security & Quality.

* **International Participation in Crash Probe**:

  * Investigation includes **US NTSB** and **UK AAIB** ‚Äî will likely bring a higher level of transparency.

---

### **5\. Mains Relevance**

#### **Issues & Challenges:**

1. **Regulatory Capture**:

   * DGCA and AAI dominated by bureaucrats with little aviation expertise.

   * Political appointments ‚Üí loss of public trust in crash investigations.

2. **Training Deficiencies**:

   * Gaps in simulator training and CRM (Crew Resource Management).

   * No standardized **recurrent training** across airlines.

3. **Infrastructure Risks**:

   * Runway maintenance poor ‚Üí bird hazard remains high.

   * Building violations near airports pose serious threat.

4. **Judicial Weakness**:

   * Courts unwilling to enforce accountability post-crashes.

   * Critical aviation safety PILs dismissed.

5. **Transparency Deficit**:

   * DGCA prematurely names pilots ‚Äî against **ICAO standards**.

   * Final crash reports often delayed or sanitised.

#### **Impacts:**

* **Society**: Public confidence in Indian aviation declining.

* **Economy**: Repeated accidents tarnish India‚Äôs global aviation reputation.

* **Polity**: Reflects institutional governance failure.

* **Environment**: Aviation accidents ‚Üí environmental damage (fuel spills, debris).

* **India‚Äôs International Standing**: ICAO compliance gap affects India‚Äôs aviation diplomacy.

#### **Ethical / Governance Concerns:**

* Misplaced focus on **blaming pilots** rather than fixing systemic flaws.

* Lack of **professional leadership** at aviation regulatory bodies.

* Judicial reluctance ‚Üí no deterrent against regulatory complacency.

---

### **6\. Way Forward**

#### **Short-Term Measures:**

‚úÖ Appoint **aviation professionals** to lead DGCA, AAI.  
 ‚úÖ Strict enforcement of **ICAO safety norms**.  
 ‚úÖ Conduct **independent crash investigations** with international oversight.  
 ‚úÖ Judicial reforms ‚Äî **special aviation safety bench** or tribunal.

#### **Medium-Term:**

‚úÖ Mandatory, **standardized simulator and CRM training** for pilots.  
 ‚úÖ Periodic **transparent safety audits** of all airlines and airports.  
 ‚úÖ Audit and enforce height restrictions near airports.

#### **Long-Term:**

‚úÖ Shift India‚Äôs aviation from a **compliance-driven** to a **culture-of-safety-driven** model.  
 ‚úÖ Enact law protecting **pilot privacy** and promoting **voluntary reporting** of hazards.  
 ‚úÖ Improve judicial capacity to handle **aviation governance cases** effectively.
