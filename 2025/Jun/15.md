## **IMD’s Heat Wave Warning System for Street Vendors**

### **1\. Basic Understanding**

* **IMD (India Meteorological Department)**: India’s national weather agency under the Ministry of Earth Sciences.

* **Heatwave**: Declared when temperatures exceed 40°C in plains and pose a health hazard.

* **Vulnerable Groups**: Street vendors, gig workers, and waste pickers face high risk during extreme heat due to prolonged outdoor exposure.

* **New Initiatives**: Use of **WhatsApp alerts**, **colour-coded placards**, and **climate messengers** for real-time, easy-to-understand heatwave warnings.

### **2\. The News**

* Amid temperatures soaring over **40°C in Delhi**, IMD launched a **pilot initiative** to deliver simplified **heatwave warnings** to vulnerable outdoor workers.

* The system involves:

  * **WhatsApp-based alerts**: A group called **“Daily Bulletin – IMD/Citizens”** sends Hindi voice notes, text updates, and infographics.

  * **Colour-coded placards**: Displayed at vendor stalls (e.g., a red placard with a distressed emoji) to indicate heat levels.

  * **Collaboration**: Launched on **June 12**, with support from **Greenpeace India** and **Delhi-based workers’ unions**.

* Goal: Disseminate **direct, daily, and understandable forecasts**—especially during **heat emergencies**.

### **3\. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC)**: Includes missions on health and sustainable habitat.

* **State Action Plans (SAPCC)**: States like Delhi develop localized heat action plans.

* **NDMA Heat Wave Guidelines**: Mandates city-level preparation and early warning dissemination.

* **Digital Inclusion**: This initiative shows how simple tools (like WhatsApp) can empower informal workers with life-saving information.

### **4\. Mains Relevance**

#### **a. Issues & Challenges**

* **Climate Vulnerability**: Street vendors lack access to cooling or shelters during extreme heat.

* **Information Gap**: Traditional alerts often don’t reach informal or low-income groups.

* **Digital Divide**: WhatsApp solutions require basic digital literacy and smartphone access.

* **Policy-Implementation Gaps**: Heatwave plans are rarely localized or worker-specific.

#### **b. Impacts**

* **Social Equity**: Bridges communication gap for underserved populations.

* **Disaster Preparedness**: Strengthens urban resilience against climate shocks.

* **Public Health**: Can reduce incidence of heatstroke and fatalities.

* **Community Engagement**: Empowers workers through participatory warning systems.

### **5\. Way Forward**

* **Scale Nationwide**: Roll out WhatsApp-alert-based systems in other heat-prone cities.

* **Local Language Integration**: Ensure multilingual support for diverse regions.

* **Link Alerts with Relief Measures**: Shade zones, water kiosks, and flexible work hours during red alerts.

* **Formal Recognition**: Include street vendors in **climate vulnerability registries** and **resilience funds**.

* **Digital Literacy Drives**: Train vulnerable groups to interpret and respond to digital warnings.
