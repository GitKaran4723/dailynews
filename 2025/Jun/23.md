  * **Misrepresentation**: Tribal faiths invisibilized in national data, affecting rights, policy, and funding.
  * **Religious Discrimination**: Covert exclusion of Christian Adivasis from ST status, while Hindu-identifying STs face no such barrier ‚Äî a clear **double standard**.
* **Impacts**:

  * **Democratic Deficit**: Lack of recognition erodes **constitutional secularism and pluralism**.
  * **Loss of Autonomy**: Undermines self-determination of Adivasi communities.
  * **Data Gap**: Skewed religious demography affects **policy design**, resource allocation, and cultural protection.
* **Ethical & Governance Concerns**:

  * Instrumentalization of religion for **political control over marginalized groups**.
  * Weakening of **federalism** and state rights (e.g., ignoring Jharkhand‚Äôs resolution).

* **Fiscal Policy**: Managed by the government. Uses tax cuts or increased spending to stimulate demand.
* **Expansionary Policy**: Both fiscal and monetary tools used to **increase aggregate demand**.
* **Repo Rate**: Rate at which RBI lends to commercial banks. Lowering it makes credit cheaper.
* **Fiscal Deficit**: When government expenditure exceeds its revenue.

### 2. **The News**

* **What**: RBI cut the repo rate by 75 basis points across two meetings (April and June 2025), bringing it to **5.5%**. Simultaneously, the government cut **income taxes** in February 2025.
* **Why**: To boost investment and consumption amid signs of economic weakness (credit slowdown, rising unemployment).
* **Outcomes so far**:

  * Inflation fell to **3%** in June (a 6-year low).
  * GDP growth projected at **6.5%** for 2025‚Äì26.
  * Credit growth at **3-year low** (9%) and **rising unemployment** signal weak demand.
* **Concerns**:

  * Lack of impact from income tax cuts raises **questions about policy effectiveness**.

  * In absence of monetary space, fiscal policy must take lead.
  * India is now using both simultaneously ‚Äî raising co-ordination concerns.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

* **Issues & Challenges**:

  * **Policy Coordination**: Without balance, dual expansion may stoke inflation or widen fiscal deficit.
  * **Weak Transmission**: Households not responding to tax cuts weakens theoretical models of forward-looking behaviour.
  * **Fiscal Sustainability**: If growth doesn‚Äôt pick up, tax revenue dips, leading to higher deficit and future cuts in essential spending.
  * **Structural Demand Constraints**: Rising inequality, wage stagnation, and informal employment limit aggregate demand growth.
* **Impact on Economy**:

  * Short-run boost likely but **long-run inflationary risk** remains if productivity doesn‚Äôt rise.
  * Risk of **social spending cuts** if deficit rises ‚Äî affecting vulnerable populations.
  * Could signal **end of inflation targeting effectiveness** if expectations misalign with outcomes.

### 5. **Way Forward**

* **Recalibrate Policy Mix**:

  * RBI must **closely monitor inflation expectations** and remain flexible in stance.
  * Govt. should combine tax cuts with **direct cash transfers or wage-linked subsidies** to target lower-income groups.
* **Strengthen Demand Side**:

  * Expand **MNREGA**, urban employment schemes, and rural infrastructure to sustain consumption.
* **Targeted Fiscal Stimulus**:

  * Protect **revenue spending** on health, food security, and education.
  * Expand **capital expenditure** to stimulate supply-side growth.
* **Reform Monetary Transmission**:

  * Ensure faster **rate cut pass-through** by banks to businesses and consumers.
* **Progressive Tax Design**:

  * Tax relief must be progressive ‚Äî high disposable income groups save more than they consume.
* **Monitor Deficit and Growth Balance**:

  * Use real-time data to adjust spending and borrowing.
  * Engage in **mid-year fiscal reviews** to course-correct if needed.
