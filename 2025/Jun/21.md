# Quantum challenge
---

## IIT-Delhi & DRDO's Quantum Communication Breakthrough

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Quantum Cybersecurity**: Uses principles of quantum mechanics (e.g., superposition, entanglement) to make communication theoretically unhackable.
* **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)**: A method where cryptographic keys are shared using quantum particles (photons). Any eavesdropping attempt disturbs the system, making interception detectable.
* **Quantum Computing Threat**: Future quantum computers could break traditional encryption (RSA, ECC), prompting the need for quantum-safe alternatives.
* **Free-space QKD**: Secure communication through open air (as opposed to fiber), vital for satellite-based global quantum networks.

### 2. **The News**

* **What**: IIT-Delhi and DRDO demonstrated **quantum key distribution** over **1 km of free space** on campus.
* **Why Important**: A crucial step toward **scalable, secure quantum communication networks**, immune to future quantum computer attacks.
* **When/Where**: Demonstration took place recently at **IIT-Delhi**.
* **Potential**: Can enable **pan-India quantum-secure communication** via satellites.
* **Challenge Highlighted**: Despite the success, bureaucratic delays and underfunding threaten the scaling and success of India’s quantum ambitions.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **National Quantum Mission (NQM)** (2023–2031): ₹6,003 crore allocation, four verticals:

  1. Quantum Computing
  2. Quantum Communication
  3. Quantum Sensing & Metrology
  4. Quantum Materials
* **Earlier Commitment**: Announced ₹8,000 crore in 2020, reduced later.
* **Institutional Mechanisms**:

  * DST and MEITY-led implementation
  * Collaboration with DRDO, ISRO, and academic institutes
* **Challenges**:

  * Slow fund disbursal
  * Lack of single-window clearance
  * High dependency on foreign hardware (cryostats, sensors)
  * Poor remuneration, project delays

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### **Issues & Challenges**:

* **Underfunding & Delays**: Only a fraction of ₹6,003 crore released; slows progress.
* **Talent Drain**: Global offers far outweigh Indian salaries.
* **Administrative Bottlenecks**: Excessive documentation, poor procurement flexibility.
* **Hardware Dependence**: Limited domestic fabrication capacity for quantum-specific devices.
* **Startup Ecosystem**: Weak VC investment, limited incubation.

#### **Impacts**:

* **National Security**: Quantum-secure communication critical for defense, strategic sectors.
* **Tech Sovereignty**: Reduces dependence on foreign encryption systems.
* **Economic**: Opens doors to a trillion-dollar quantum tech market.
* **Research Ecosystem**: Elevates India’s position in cutting-edge scientific research.
* **Ethical Angle**: Ensures citizen data protection in the post-quantum era.

### 5. **Way Forward**

* **Administrative Reform**: Establish **single-window systems**, streamline documentation, ease procurement norms.
* **Talent Retention**: Offer competitive fellowships, tenure tracks, and lab autonomy.
* **Domestic Capability**: Incentivize R\&D and local manufacturing for quantum hardware (cryostats, sensors).
* **Mission Mode Funding**: Ensure time-bound fund release and output-based auditing.
* **Public-Private Partnerships**: Encourage startups, incubate quantum-tech ventures, and foster VC interest.

# ‘Monetary policy left with limited space to support growth’
---

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Monetary Policy**: Refers to the actions taken by a country’s central bank (in India, the **RBI**) to control money supply, inflation, and interest rates to ensure economic stability and growth.
* **Instruments**: Repo rate, reverse repo rate, CRR, SLR, open market operations, etc.
* **Support Growth**: In economic slowdowns, central banks cut interest rates to boost borrowing, investment, and consumption.
* **Limited Space**: Refers to a situation where central banks can no longer reduce interest rates or expand money supply further without adverse consequences like inflation or currency depreciation.

### 2. **The News**

* RBI and other global central banks are facing constraints in using **monetary policy to boost economic growth**.
* With **inflationary pressures still high** (often above target bands), cutting interest rates further risks worsening inflation.
* Rising **fiscal deficits**, **global commodity price volatility**, and **geopolitical tensions** (e.g., oil supply) reduce the effectiveness of conventional monetary tools.
* As a result, there’s **limited policy space** left for RBI to lower rates or expand liquidity without compromising macroeconomic stability.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Inflation Targeting Framework** (2016): Legally mandates RBI to keep inflation at **4% ±2%**.
* **MPC (Monetary Policy Committee)**: Decides repo rate, balancing inflation and growth.
* **Government Fiscal Policies**: Capex push via Union Budget, PLI schemes, infrastructure spending — used when monetary tools are exhausted.
* **Liquidity Measures**: RBI undertook LTROs, SDF, CRR tweaks during COVID.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### **Issues and Challenges**

* **Stagflation risk**: Low growth + high inflation = difficult policy trade-offs.
* **Transmission lag**: Interest rate cuts may not immediately stimulate demand.
* **Global Spillovers**: US Fed hikes, capital outflows, and exchange rate volatility affect policy autonomy.
* **Debt burden**: Cheap credit overuse during past years has created asset bubbles and private over-leveraging.

#### **Impacts**

* **Growth Slowdown**: Limited monetary easing = slower credit revival in MSMEs, housing, etc.
* **Investment Climate**: Higher rates discourage private investment.
* **Currency Stability vs. Exports**: A tight policy supports the rupee but affects export competitiveness.

#### **Ethical/Governance Angle**

* Ensuring price stability without hurting the poor (most affected by inflation).
* Transparency in monetary policy decisions and communications.

### 5. **Way Forward**

* **Strengthen Fiscal-Monetary Coordination**: Counter-cyclical public spending when monetary leeway is low.
* **Improve Credit Flow to Productive Sectors**: Targeted lending, credit guarantees.
* **Enhance Financial Inclusion**: Broaden access to formal credit, especially for rural and informal sectors.
* **Inflation Management**: Strengthen supply chains, reduce import dependence (e.g., food, energy).
* **Macroprudential Tools**: Use non-rate tools like CRR, LTV ratios to manage inflation without harming growth.
