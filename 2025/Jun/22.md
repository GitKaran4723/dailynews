## Mobile-Based AI Facial Recognition Attendance in Karnataka Schools

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Facial Recognition Attendance System (FRAS):** Uses AI to identify and verify individuals via facial data.
* **Advanced Vector-Based Engine:** Converts facial features into encrypted numerical vectors ensuring privacy (data can't be reverse-engineered).
* **Student Achievement Tracking System (SATS):** Karnataka’s centralized database storing student details for academic and administrative monitoring.
* **Karnataka State Data Centre (KSDC):** A secure state-managed server hosting sensitive government applications and databases.

### 2. **The News**

* On **Saturday**, the **Karnataka government** ordered the **mandatory implementation** of a **mobile-based AI facial recognition attendance system** in **all 52,686 government and aided schools** starting **academic year 2025–26**.
* A **mobile app** integrated with **SATS** will capture student attendance and ensure **real-time monitoring** of **52.55 lakh students**.
* The system uses **vector-based encryption** to protect privacy and is hosted on **KSDC servers** in Vikasa Soudha.
* A **pilot** in **Uttara Kannada (2024)** tested the system's feasibility.
* It also links attendance to welfare delivery like **midday meals, eggs, uniforms**, etc.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**
