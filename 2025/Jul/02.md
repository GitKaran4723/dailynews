## **Electoral Roll Revision Crisis in Bihar**

### **1\. Basic Understanding**

* **Electoral Rolls**: Official lists of people eligible to vote. Updated periodically to add new voters and remove ineligible ones.

* **Special Intensive Revision (SIR)**: A focused effort by the Election Commission to update and verify electoral rolls in a specific region.

* **Election Commission of India (ECI)**: A constitutional body that conducts and regulates elections in India.

* **Electoral Registration Officers (EROs)**: Officials who verify and enroll voters.

* **Booth-Level Officers (BLOs)**: Field-level agents who assist in voter registration and verification.

### **2\. The News**

* The ECI's ongoing **Special Intensive Revision (SIR)** in **Bihar** has seen over **11% of estimated electors** submitting voter forms.

* Initially, the **CEO of Bihar** allowed leniency in document submission, allowing voters to register without the required 11 documents.

* However, the **Chief Election Commissioner (CEC)** contradicted this, stating that document submission is **mandatory by July 25, 2025**, with a claims/objections period from **Aug 1‚ÄìSep 1**.

* This confusion endangers voter registration, especially for **poor and marginalized sections** lacking documents.

* **Local-level verification** adds subjectivity and may lead to **wrongful inclusions or exclusions**.

### **3\. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Article 324 of the Constitution** empowers the ECI to supervise elections.

* **Voter registration reforms** (e.g., continuous updating, linking with Aadhaar under EPIC-ER linkage) aim for clean rolls.

* ECI has promoted **Aadhaar-voter ID linking** but clarified it is **not mandatory**.

* **Booth Level Officers (BLOs)** and **State Election Departments** are part of the institutional framework.

* The **Supreme Court** is currently hearing petitions regarding the legality and fairness of the SIR in Bihar.

### **4\. Mains Relevance**

**Issues & Challenges**:

* Conflicting instructions from top ECI officers undermine trust in institutions.

* Poor documentation among Bihar‚Äôs rural and poor population leads to **disenfranchisement**.

* Over-reliance on local discretion risks **bias**, **corruption**, and **exclusion**.

**Impact on Society & Polity**:

* Risk of violating **universal adult franchise** enshrined in Article 326\.

* Marginalized communities may feel **alienated** and **mistrust democratic processes**.

* Erodes **institutional credibility** and risks public protest or legal backlash.

**Ethical Concerns**:

* Treating all voters as ‚Äúsuspect‚Äù unless proven otherwise violates principles of **justice** and **dignity**.

* Raises issues of **inclusiveness** in electoral democracy.

### **5\. Way Forward**

* ECI must **standardize** its instructions and avoid contradictory communication.

* Accept **more accessible ID proofs** like Aadhaar, ration cards, MGNREGA cards, which are widely held.

* Build capacity in **digital and offline grievance redressal mechanisms**.

* Launch **massive awareness and assistance drives** with NGOs and local institutions.

* Institutionalize **audit and accountability** for BLOs and EROs during verification.

* Supreme Court should offer **guiding principles** to balance integrity with inclusiveness.

---

### **üìù Prelims Tidbits**

* Article 324: Powers of the ECI.

* Article 326: Universal Adult Franchise.

* Aadhaar-voter linking is voluntary, not mandatory.

* BLOs: Grassroots ECI field officers assisting voter registration.

* Claims & Objections period is part of every voter list revision.

## **Batting for Prevention: Need for a One Health Approach Against Nipah**

### **1\. Basic Understanding**

* **Nipah Virus (NiV)**: A highly fatal zoonotic virus (transmitted from animals to humans), primarily carried by **fruit bats**.

* **Zoonotic Spillover**: The transmission of infectious diseases from animals to humans.

* **One Health**: A collaborative, multisectoral approach that links human, animal, and environmental health to tackle infectious diseases.

* **Transmission**: Through direct contact with infected animals, humans, or contaminated food (like fruits licked by bats).

* **Mortality Rate**: Between **40% and 75%**, which makes even one case a major public health alarm.

### **2\. The News**

* In **July 2025**, **Kerala** reported **two Nipah cases**: a teenage girl in **Malappuram** (who died) and a woman in **Palakkad** (in critical condition).

* Over **425 contacts** have been traced across **Malappuram (228), Palakkad (110), and Kozhikode (87)**.

* At least **140+ health workers** are under surveillance; **5 people are in ICU** in Malappuram.

* The **source of infection is still under investigation**, and **containment measures** are active.

* Previous outbreaks include **West Bengal (2001)** and **Kerala (2018)**, with high death rates.

### **3\. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Kerala Health Department** activated containment zones and contact tracing immediately.

* **ICMR and NIV** have been pivotal in setting up rapid testing and biosafety labs.

* **National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC)** monitors and supports outbreak response.

* **Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP)** monitors emerging zoonotic diseases.

* **India‚Äôs draft One Health Framework (2021)** aims to build resilience against zoonotic threats by converging animal-human-environment surveillance.

**Impact on Society, Economy, and Governance**:

* Public fear, ICU overloading, and economic slowdown in affected regions.

* Health worker vulnerability and burnout during outbreaks.

* Reveals the **urgent need for early warning systems** and **community awareness**.

**Ethical and Governance Concerns**:

* Ensuring **privacy and dignity** of infected individuals.

* Balancing **public safety with civil liberties** during quarantine and movement restrictions.

### **5\. Way Forward**

* **Implement a nationwide One Health programme**, integrating data from animal husbandry, forest, and public health sectors.

* Promote **awareness campaigns** in endemic areas‚Äîespecially regarding fruit hygiene and avoiding bat-contaminated areas.

* **Strengthen surveillance systems** at local and district levels with mobile labs and rapid response teams.

* Encourage **research and vaccine development** for Nipah and other emerging zoonotic pathogens.

* **Ban sale of partially eaten fruits** in markets; regulate palm sap collection practices which attract bats.

* Expand and train **public health emergency response teams** under the NDMA framework.

## **Rising Seas, Shifting Lives: Climate Displacement and Democratic Accountability**

### **1\. Basic Understanding**

* **Climate-induced displacement**: Migration caused by slow-onset effects like sea-level rise, saltwater intrusion, and habitat destruction.

* **Zoonotic spillover vs. displacement**: While zoonotic events are sudden, displacement is gradual yet equally devastating.

* **CRZ (Coastal Regulation Zone) Notification**: Legal framework regulating development on India‚Äôs coasts; 2019 version has been criticized for being pro-industry.

* **Informal labour**: Employment without social security, legal protections, or contracts ‚Äî common among displaced persons.

* **Article 21**: Right to life and dignity under the Constitution ‚Äî applicable to displaced persons too.

### **2\. The News**

* Rising seas and environmental degradation have **displaced coastal communities** in **Odisha (Satabhaya)**, **Karnataka (Honnavar)**, **Tamil Nadu (Nagapattinam)**, **Gujarat (Kutch)**, and **Kerala**.

* Displaced people are **pushed into exploitative informal jobs** in cities like **Bhubaneswar, Chennai, Hyderabad, Mumbai**.

* **Projects under Sagarmala**, energy expansion, and tourism have worsened ecological vulnerability.

* Displacement is **legal vacuum** ‚Äî no specific law protects **climate migrants** in India.

* Grassroots protests against ecologically harmful development are often met with **surveillance and criminalization**.

### **3\. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **NAPCC (National Action Plan on Climate Change)** and **SAPCCs** acknowledge vulnerability but offer no concrete rehabilitation roadmap.

* **Disaster Management Act (2005)** and **Environment Protection Act (1986)** offer **response-based** not **rights-based** solutions.

* **CRZ 2019**: Diluted zoning laws; prioritizes industry over communities.

* **Labour Codes** do not recognize or protect climate migrants, despite India‚Äôs pledge to **SDG 8.7** (ending forced labour).

* **Judicial Activism**: SC cases like **M.C. Mehta (1987)** and **Enviro-Legal Action (1996)** link environment with fundamental rights, but implementation is weak.

### **4\. Mains Relevance**

**Issues & Challenges**

* **Lack of legal recognition** of climate displacement.

* **Unregulated coastal development** exacerbating vulnerability.

* **Gendered impacts** ‚Äî women in domestic work face abuse, underpayment, and trafficking.

* **Weak enforcement of environmental protections** and labour safeguards.

**Impact on Society & Economy**

* Displacement affects **livelihoods, education, health**, and dignity.

* Rural to urban migration fuels **urban poverty** and **informal employment**.

* Erodes **trust in institutions** when communities are displaced without consent.

**Ethical & Governance Concerns**

* Displacement without consent violates the **right to life and dignity**.

* Criminalising protest challenges **freedom of expression and association**.

* **Managed retreat** without participation is undemocratic and exclusionary.

### **5\. Way Forward**

* **Legal Framework**: Enact laws recognizing **climate migrants**, including **resettlement rights**, livelihood support, and legal status.

* **Labour Reform**: Extend labour protections to informal climate-displaced workers, especially in construction and domestic work.

* **Coastal Zone Planning**: Reform CRZ to prioritize **community-based conservation**, not just commercial interests.

* **Participatory Development**: Mandate **Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC)** for all coastal projects.

* **Urban Inclusion**: Integrate displaced populations into **urban housing, healthcare, and education schemes**.

* **Environmental Justice**: Translate SC‚Äôs environmental jurisprudence into actionable laws protecting both land and people.

* **Kerala** has the lowest MMR (20); **Madhya Pradesh (175)** and **Assam (167)** among the highest.

* In **EAG states** (Bihar, MP, UP, etc.), delays and systemic deficiencies continue.

* Shortages of **specialists, blood banks**, and surgical facilities at CHCs and FRUs remain serious issues.

* **Postpartum hemorrhage**, **obstructed labour**, and **hypertensive disorders** are leading medical causes.

* **ASHA workers**, **emergency transport**, and **financial incentives** have helped improve institutional deliveries.

### **3\. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **National Rural Health Mission (NRHM)** launched in 2005; includes ASHA and ANM networking.

* **National Health Mission (NHM)** now oversees maternal care systems, audits, and incentives.

* **Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY)** offers cash incentives for institutional deliveries.

* **108 Ambulance service** provides emergency transport.

* **Maternal Death Review (MDR)** and **Confidential Review (Kerala model)** identify systemic failures.
