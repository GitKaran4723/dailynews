#### **Issues & Challenges:**

* **Low Innovation Translation**: Despite funding, limited conversion to patents, products, and industry-level collaboration.

* **Startups & Deep-Tech Exclusion**: Limited support to emerging tech sectors.

* **HR Imbalance**: Over-reliance on contractual staff, stagnation in women scientists’ numbers.

* **Siloed Functioning**: Insufficient inter-lab collaboration and synergy with higher education.

#### **Impacts:**

* **Economic**: Limits R\&D’s contribution to industrial growth and self-reliance (Atmanirbhar Bharat).

* **Social**: Missed opportunities to address public health, sanitation, or climate challenges through innovation.

* **Demographic**: Underutilization of young and female talent in the scientific workforce.

### **5\. Way Forward**

1. **Mandate Innovation KPIs**: Set performance indicators tied to startup incubation, patent generation, and tech transfer.

2. **Strengthen Lab-Industry-Academia Linkages**: Formalize collaboration frameworks; incentivize co-development of technologies.

3. **Enable Open Science Platforms**: Share lab resources, testing facilities, and datasets with startups and universities.

4. **Diversify Human Resources**: Encourage women participation and convert contractual roles into permanent research positions.

5. **Institutional Support via Section 8 Companies**: Create embedded innovation hubs and facilitate ease of startup engagement.

## **Are Vaccine-Preventable Diseases Rising?**

### **1\. Basic Understanding**

* **Vaccine-Preventable Diseases (VPDs)**: Diseases like measles, polio, diphtheria, and meningitis, which can be controlled or eliminated through immunisation.

* **Routine Immunisation**: Regularly scheduled vaccines given to children and pregnant women to prevent VPDs.

* **Immunisation Agenda 2030 (IA2030)**: A WHO-led global strategy to strengthen immunisation systems and ensure equitable access to vaccines.

* **Universal Immunization Programme (UIP)**: India's flagship public health programme targeting millions of children and pregnant women annually with life-saving vaccines.

### **2\. The News**

* **What**: WHO, UNICEF, and Gavi have raised alarm over the **global rise of vaccine-preventable diseases** due to missed immunisations and disrupted vaccination systems.

* **When**: Their warning follows a **WHO survey in 108 countries** and precedes **Gavi’s pledging summit on June 25, 2025**.

* **Why**:

  * **Funding cuts**

  * **Misinformation**

  * **Pandemic-related disruptions**

  * **Population growth and conflict zones**

* **Who**: Key organisations — **WHO, UNICEF, Gavi**, and national governments including **India**.

### **3\. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Global**:

  * **Big Catch-Up Initiative (2023)**: A campaign to recover pandemic-missed vaccines.

  * **Gavi’s June 2025 Summit**: Target to raise **$9 billion** to vaccinate **500 million children (2026–2030)**.

  * **Immunisation Agenda 2030 (IA2030)**: Multilateral effort to expand access to vaccines.

* **India**:

  * **Universal Immunization Programme (UIP)**:

    * Targets **26 million children** and **34 million pregnant women** annually.

    * Offers vaccines against **measles, rubella, polio, tetanus, rotavirus, PCV**, etc.

  * Achievements:

    * **Polio-free** certification in **2014**.

    * **Maternal and neonatal tetanus** eliminated in **2015**.

    * Introduction of **MR, RVV, and PCV vaccines**.

  * **NFHS-5 (2019–21)**: Full immunisation coverage at **76.1%** — meaning 1 in 4 children still misses critical vaccines.

### **4\. Mains Relevance**

#### **Issues & Challenges:**

* **Disruptions post-COVID-19**: Global supply chains, surveillance, and outreach were all impacted.

* **Funding Gaps**: Especially in fragile, conflict-affected states.

* **Misinformation**: Vaccine hesitancy fuelled by social media.

* **Surveillance Decline**: Weak disease-tracking systems increase outbreak risks.

#### **Impacts:**

* **Health**: Resurgence of diseases like **measles** even in developed nations (e.g., U.S.).

* **Economy**: Treating outbreaks costs more than prevention.

* **Equity**: Disparities in vaccine access widen health inequities globally.

* **India-specific**: Progress risks reversal if immunisation momentum is lost.

### **5\. Way Forward**

1. **Sustain and Increase Funding**: Fulfill Gavi’s 2025 funding goal; nations must prioritize immunisation in national budgets.

2. **Fight Misinformation**: Launch scientific and community-led awareness campaigns to combat vaccine hesitancy.

3. **Catch-Up Campaigns**: Extend and intensify efforts like the Big Catch-Up to cover zero-dose children.

4. **Strengthen Surveillance**: Invest in real-time disease tracking and early outbreak response systems.

5. **Boost Coverage in India**: Focus on underperforming districts; integrate digital tracking (e.g., Co-WIN-like platforms for UIP).

### **Prelims Pointers**

* **Big Catch-Up**: Global campaign (2023–) to address missed childhood vaccinations post-pandemic.

* **NFHS-5 (2019–21)**: India's full immunisation coverage \= **76.1%**.

* **Gavi**: Vaccine alliance that funds immunisation in low-income countries.

* **UIP**: Covers 26 million children and 34 million pregnant women in India annually.

* **Return on Investment in Vaccines**: $54 for every $1 invested (WHO).
