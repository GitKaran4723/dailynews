* The incident came to light when the girl informed her mother in **late April**, leading to an **FIR on April 30** and the subsequent **arrest of the accused**.

* On **Wednesday night (May 1\)**, **communal tension flared** as mobs vandalized shops and vehicles in protest, triggering fear among locals and tourists.

* Authorities deployed heavy police presence, initiated peace marches, and urged the public not to damage Nainital’s **tourism-dependent image**.

* The **NCW condemned** the act and urged the Uttarakhand DGP for swift and strict action.

* Tourists began leaving the city, and many cancelled upcoming bookings amid rising insecurity.

### **3\. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Legal Action**:

  * FIR under **IPC sections and POCSO Act**.

  * Arrest and judicial custody of the accused.

  * Counselling ordered for the minor by the **District Magistrate**.

* **Policing and Crowd Control**:

  * Peace marches, rapid deployment of forces to prevent escalation.

* **Tourism Impact**: Nainital as a major tourist hub affected by communal incidents.

### **5\. Mains Relevance**

**Issues & Challenges**

* **Communal polarization**: Crimes committed by individuals often misused to stoke broader religious tensions.

* **Mob violence and vigilante justice**: Undermines rule of law.

* **Victim protection**: Often secondary to political and communal narratives.

* **Tourism impact**: Violence harms local economy and public perception of safety.

**Impacts**

* **Social**: Heightens mistrust, communal divides, and psychological trauma for victims.

* **Economic**: Nainital’s economy, highly reliant on tourism, faces booking cancellations.

* **Governance**: Law enforcement and administration come under pressure to manage both justice and peace.

* **Ethical**: Upholding dignity of the minor victim while preventing communal hate and false generalizations.

**Ethical/Governance Concerns**

* Ensuring **due process of law**, avoiding **trial by media or mob**.

* Balancing **public anger** with **legal and constitutional values**.

### **6\. Way Forward**

* **Swift judicial action** under POCSO with sensitive handling of the minor victim’s rehabilitation.

* **Community outreach programs** by local administration to prevent polarization.

* **Strict action** against rioters and those inciting communal hatred under **Section 153A IPC** (promoting enmity).

* **Tourism protection measures**: Public communication assuring safety to prevent cancellations.

* Media and public figures must promote **calm, responsible discourse**, avoiding inflammatory rhetoric.

### **Case Study: Nainital Communal Tension Over Minor’s Rape**

The recent incident in Nainital, where the rape of a 12-year-old girl led to communal tensions and mob violence, presents a serious ethical challenge. The crime itself is heinous and demands strict legal action. However, the subsequent breakdown of law and order, driven by communal narratives, undermines both justice and societal peace.

**As a civil servant**, my first duty is to uphold **justice and rule of law**. I would ensure the **speedy and sensitive handling** of the case under the **POCSO Act**, including the minor’s protection, counselling, and confidentiality.

Simultaneously, it is critical to **prevent the communalization** of the crime. Crimes are committed by individuals, not communities. Collective blame and mob action violate constitutional values. I would enforce **Section 153A IPC** against those inciting communal hatred and take **firm action against vandalism** and violence.

Maintaining **public trust and calm** is vital in a tourist-dependent region like Nainital. I would initiate **peace-building measures** such as inter-community dialogues, press briefings, and patrol deployment to assure safety and normalcy.

The **media** should be engaged through advisories to report responsibly and avoid sensationalism that inflames passions. Civil society and religious leaders can be mobilized to appeal for unity.

Ultimately, this situation demands a balance between **legal firmness**, **empathy for the victim**, and **social harmony**. As Gandhi said, *"An eye for an eye will make the whole world blind."* We must ensure justice is done without allowing it to descend into hatred.

## **Veerashaiva-Lingayats to Seek Separate Religion Code in Census**

### **1\. Basic Understanding**

* **Veerashaiva-Lingayats** are a socio-religious community with a significant presence in Karnataka and surrounding states.

* **Lingayatism**, founded by **Basavanna in the 12th century**, is a distinct spiritual movement emphasizing monotheism, anti-caste ideals, and social reform.

* **Veerashaivas**, traditionally seen as followers of Shaivism, are sometimes considered separate by those who view Lingayatism as distinct from mainstream Hinduism.

* A **religion code** in the Census refers to a unique numeric or categorical identifier for recognized religions. As of the 2011 Census, only six religions—Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, Sikhism, Buddhism, and Jainism—had specific codes, with others grouped under "Other religions and persuasions".

### **2\. The News**

* The **Akhila Bharatha Veerashaiva Mahasabha** is preparing to petition the Central Government for a **separate religion code** for **Veerashaiva-Lingayats** in the upcoming **national Census**.

* The move revives an old demand that was earlier voiced ahead of the **2018 Karnataka Assembly elections** and previously during the **1940s, 1971, 2001, and 2011 censuses**.

* **Internal differences** exist within the community, as the **Jagathika Lingayat Mahasabha** seeks a distinct religion code under just **‘Lingayat’**, while the Veerashaiva Mahasabha proposes the name **‘Veerashaiva-Lingayat’**.

* The **2015 Socio-Economic and Educational Survey** put their population at **11% of Karnataka’s** total, which the Mahasabha disputes, claiming it to be **18–22%**.

* The community holds **significant socio-political clout** in Karnataka and has a spread across Maharashtra, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala.

### **3\. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Census Operations**: Conducted under the **Census Act, 1948**, with the **Registrar General and Census Commissioner** responsible for religious data categorization.

* In **2011**, only six religions had codes. Others were recorded under **"Other Religions and Persuasions (ORP)"**.

* Past **petitions** by Veerashaiva and Lingayat groups were acknowledged but did not lead to a separate classification.

* The **Justice Nagamohan Das Committee** in Karnataka had recommended **Lingayats as a religious minority**, but it was not implemented due to political transitions.

### **4\. Prelims-Focused Points**

* **Basavanna**: 12th-century reformer, key figure in Lingayat philosophy.

* **Census Act, 1948**: Legal basis for India’s decadal census.

* **Category 3B** in Karnataka OBC list includes Veerashaiva-Lingayats.

* 2015 Kantharaj Report: Estimated Veerashaiva-Lingayat population at 66.35 lakh.

* **Religious code**: A digit/category assigned to a religion during Census enumeration.

### **5\. Mains Relevance**

**Issues & Challenges**

* **Identity conflict** within the community (Veerashaiva vs. Lingayat).

* **Religious classification and political implications** in a secular state.

* Risks of **vote-bank politics** around religion-based census claims.

* **Legal ambiguity** in defining religion and community for administrative classification.

**Impacts**

* **Sociopolitical**: Could influence minority status, educational & employment quotas.

* **Administrative**: May require restructuring of religious codes and population data categorization.

* **Cultural**: May reinforce community pride or deepen intra-community divisions.

* **Policy framing**: Affects OBC reservations, minority welfare, and census-based planning.

**Ethical/Governance Concerns**

* **Balancing community rights vs. secular governance**.

* **Avoiding misuse** of religious identity for political gain.

* Need for **transparent and inclusive policy framing** based on evidence and consultation.

### **6\. Way Forward**

* **Establish an expert committee** to examine historical, religious, and social claims of the community impartially.

* Consider **criteria-based recognition of religious codes** (doctrinal uniqueness, institutional setup, population size).

* **Facilitate community consultations** to resolve internal naming/nomenclature disputes.

* Ensure that **religious classification does not override constitutional secularism** or lead to politicization.

* Maintain **transparency in Census methodology** and communicate clearly to prevent misinformation and tension.

## **Debate: Should Lingayats Be Considered a Separate Religion?**

---

### **✅ Arguments *For* Recognizing Lingayats as a Separate Religion**

1. **Doctrinal Differences**

   * **Lingayatism**, founded by **Basavanna**, rejects **caste system**, **ritualism**, and **Vedic authority**—core to orthodox Hinduism.

   * Lingayats worship **Ishtalinga**, and their practices differ significantly from mainstream Shaivism.

2. **Historical Demands**

   * As early as **1940**, the **Veerashaiva Mahasabha** passed resolutions for separate religious recognition.

   * Multiple census petitions (1971, 2001, 2011\) demonstrate **long-standing demand**.

3. **Distinct Identity and Social Reform**

   * Lingayatism evolved as a **social reform movement** advocating **gender equality**, **non-Brahmanical spirituality**, and **monotheism**, qualifying as an **independent religion**.

4. **Precedents of Recognition**

   * The Indian state has earlier recognized **Jainism, Buddhism, and Sikhism** as separate despite their historical links to Hindu culture.

   * **Justice Nagamohan Das Committee** (2018) recommended minority status for Lingayats.

5. **Administrative Clarity**

   * A separate religion code will help gather accurate socio-economic and demographic data to tailor welfare policies.

---

### **❌ Arguments *Against* Recognizing Lingayats as a Separate Religion**

1. **Overlap with Hinduism**

   * Many Lingayats still perform **Hindu rituals**, celebrate **Hindu festivals**, and follow **Shaiva traditions**, indicating cultural and religious integration.

   * The term **Veerashaiva-Lingayat** often blends with Hindu identity.

2. **Internal Division**

   * Sharp divide between **Veerashaivas** (traditional Shaivas) and **Lingayats** (Basava followers) weakens consensus for separate religion.

   * Conflicting nomenclature (e.g., Lingayat vs. Veerashaiva-Lingayat) undermines the movement’s coherence.

3. **Political Motivation**

   * Accusations that the demand peaks **before elections**, suggesting political use rather than spiritual necessity.

   * Risks **vote bank fragmentation** and polarizing communities.

4. **Constitutional Caution**

   * Article 25 allows **freedom within broader religious identities**. Encouraging segmentation may harm **India’s secular and inclusive fabric**.

5. **Policy Complications**

   * New religion tag could impact **OBC status**, **reservation benefits**, and **minority rights**, creating **legal and bureaucratic confusion**.

---

### **🧭 Balanced Conclusion**

While the **Lingayat philosophy has unique doctrinal elements**, recognition as a separate religion must be based on **consensus within the community**, **historical validation**, and **constitutional principles**. The state must **avoid politicization**, focus on **identity protection**, and ensure **cohesion over division**.

## **IIA Team Maps Plasma Shifts Beneath Sun's Surface**

### **1\. Basic Understanding**

* The **Sun’s internal structure** has different layers — from the core to the outer atmosphere — and understanding its **plasma dynamics** is vital to predicting **solar behavior and space weather**.

* The **Near-Surface Shear Layer (NSSL)** is a zone roughly **35,000 km below the Sun’s surface**, where the **rotation rate varies with depth**, and is thought to play a role in the **solar magnetic cycle**.

* **Plasma** — ionized gas — is in constant motion inside the Sun and is responsible for generating **magnetic fields** through a dynamo mechanism.

* **Space weather**, influenced by solar activity like flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), affects Earth’s **satellites, GPS, power grids**, and even climate patterns.

### **2\. The News**

* A research team led by the **Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA)**, with contributions from **Stanford University** and **U.S. National Solar Observatory**, has discovered **massive plasma flows beneath the Sun’s surface**, using data published in the *Astrophysical Journal Letters*.

* These **plasma currents** in the **NSSL** were found to shift with the Sun’s **magnetic cycles**, potentially influencing **solar activity and space weather** on Earth.

* The flows **converge near sunspots**, reverse midway, and then **circulate outward**, forming **giant convection-like cells** influenced by the **Coriolis force**, just like Earth’s hurricanes.

* Lead researcher **Prof. S.P. Rajaguru** and PhD scholar **Anisha Sen** from IIA found that these patterns could reveal deeper, **yet-unknown forces** governing the Sun’s global magnetic dynamics.

### **3\. Government Interventions & Scientific Infrastructure**

* **IIA (Indian Institute of Astrophysics)** is under the **Department of Science and Technology**, GoI, and specializes in solar and space research.

* India has developed **Aditya-L1**, its first solar observatory mission (ISRO), to study the **solar corona and space weather**.

* **ISRO–IIA–IUCAA collaborations** aim to enhance solar and space research through ground-based and orbital missions.

* **National Large Solar Telescope (NLST)** project is in progress to boost India’s solar observational capacity.

### **4\. Prelims-Focused Points**

* **NSSL (Near-Surface Shear Layer)**: \~35,000 km below Sun’s surface, zone of rotational transition.

* **Plasma**: Fourth state of matter; electrically conductive ionized gas.

* **Coriolis Force**: Acts on rotating bodies; causes deflection in fluid flows (e.g., winds, ocean currents).

* **Aditya-L1**: India’s solar mission launched by ISRO to Lagrangian point L1.

* **Space Weather**: Conditions in space affected by the solar wind, CMEs, solar flares.
