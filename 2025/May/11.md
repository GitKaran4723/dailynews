## **India-Pakistan Ceasefire ‚ÄòUnderstanding‚Äô Amid Violations**

### **1\. Basic Understanding**

* **Ceasefire Agreement**: India and Pakistan have a Line of Control (LoC) ceasefire understanding since 2003 to prevent hostilities.

* **LoC**: The military control line dividing Indian and Pakistani controlled parts of Jammu & Kashmir.

* **Cross-border violations**: Shelling or firing across the LoC; often escalates tensions.

* **Terrorism & Diplomacy**: India maintains a "terror and talks cannot go together" policy, especially post-Pulwama and Uri attacks.

### **2\. The News**

* On **May 10, 2025**, India confirmed that **Pakistan had initiated backchannel communication** for reviving the 2003 **LoC ceasefire understanding**.

* Despite the outreach, **Pakistani forces violated the ceasefire in Tangdhar (Kupwara)** the same day.

* This comes in the backdrop of the **Pahalgam terror attack** (April 22\) which killed **26 civilians**, after which India promised strong retaliation.

* Reports suggest the **US may have facilitated** this diplomatic initiative, though both India and Pakistan remain officially silent.

### **3\. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **2003 Ceasefire Understanding**: Not a treaty, but an informal military agreement to stop hostilities.

* **Doval Doctrine**: India‚Äôs strategic doctrine combining offensive defence with diplomacy.

* **Recent Trends**: India‚Äôs stand since 2016 has been **zero tolerance towards terror**, supporting surgical strikes and Balakot airstrike.

* **Institutional Mechanisms**:

  * **DGMO-level talks** for de-escalation.

  * **Ministry of External Affairs (MEA)** coordination with NSA and armed forces.

  * **UNMOGIP** exists but is not recognized by India.

### **4\. Mains Relevance**

#### **Issues and Challenges**

* **Lack of trust**: Violation even after diplomatic outreach signals lack of commitment.

* **Terror-State Nexus**: Cross-border terrorism remains the biggest hurdle.

* **Backchannel Diplomacy**: Often lacks transparency and parliamentary oversight.

* **International Involvement**: Raises sovereignty concerns if foreign powers mediate.

#### **Impact**

* **Security**: Violations threaten civilian life and defense preparedness.

* **Foreign Policy**: India‚Äôs position on bilateralism tested if third-party mediators are involved.

* **Public Sentiment**: Strong nationalist emotions influence domestic discourse.

#### **Ethical/Governance Concerns**

* Maintaining peace while defending sovereignty.

* Managing war rhetoric and responsible state behavior.

### **5\. Way Forward**

* **Transparent Dialogue**: Use structured and official platforms for communication, not informal backchannels.

* **Accountability Measures**: Pakistan must be held accountable for cross-border terror; India can engage only with credible guarantees.

* **People-Centric Approach**: Enhance civilian protection measures (bunkers, alert systems) near LoC areas.

* **International Diplomacy**: Continue exposing Pakistan's duplicity at global forums like FATF and UN.

* **Strengthen Border Management**: Integrate tech surveillance with local intelligence for LoC monitoring.
