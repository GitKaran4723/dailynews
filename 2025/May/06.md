* **Wetlands**: Ecologically sensitive ecosystems that support biodiversity, regulate floods, and recharge groundwater.

* **Logistics Park**: A hub designed for transport, warehousing, and distribution services; often seen as critical for boosting economic infrastructure.

* **AIDC (Assam Industrial Development Corporation)**: A government agency responsible for industrial promotion and land acquisition for projects.

### **2\. The News**

* On **April 7, 2025**, the **Kamrup district administration** notified plans to acquire **150 bighas (≈49.59 acres)** of **Dorabeel grazing land** near Guwahati for a **logistics park** to be set up by a **Kolkata-based firm**.

* Villagers from **21 villages** protested, citing the field's importance for **over 3,000 livestock-rearing families** and **500 pottery-making families**.

* The land also **adjoins an ecologically sensitive wetland**, raising environmental concerns.

* Community leaders have threatened a **mass public movement** if the project proceeds without addressing their grievances.

### **3\. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Forest Rights Act, 2006 (FRA)**: Recognizes rights of traditional forest dwellers over land and resources. If applicable, villagers may seek rights under this Act.

* **Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2017**: Prohibits or restricts development near ecologically fragile wetlands.

* **Governance**: Raises ethical and legal concerns over land rights, public consultation, and environmental compliance.

### **5\. Way Forward**

* **Conduct a Social Impact Assessment (SIA)**: As per 2013 LARR Act, evaluate displacement risk and propose rehabilitation plans.

* **Respect Gram Sabha Consent**: If applicable under PESA/FRA in Scheduled Areas, acquire consent of village-level bodies.

* **Environmental Clearance**: Require detailed ecological assessment due to wetland proximity; involve ASWA in decision-making.

* **Explore Alternative Sites**: Shift project to non-ecologically sensitive and less livelihood-dependent land.

* **Promote Dialogue**: Ensure meaningful engagement with community members and consider compensation/resettlement if unavoidable.
