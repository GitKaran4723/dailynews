* Low awareness among illiterate or semi-literate mothers

* Inconsistent data entry by ASHA/Anganwadi workers

* Loss or damage of physical cards

* Language and accessibility barriers

* Lack of integration with digital health records in many states

**Impacts:**

* **Health:** Missed immunizations, late detection of underweight or stunted children

* **Education:** Delays in early childhood care and education enrolment

* **Women Empowerment:** Reduces agency if mothers are unaware of health entitlements

* **Governance:** Weak link in tracking national health targets (IMR, MMR, nutrition levels)

**Ethical/Governance Angle:**

* Denial of services due to lack of card/documentation

* Need for inclusive and respectful health communication

---

### **5\. Way Forward**

* **Community Awareness Drives:** Involve SHGs, schoolteachers, and local leaders

* **Simplify and Translate:** MCP cards should be in local language with pictorial guidance

* **Digitization:** Develop **m-MCP App** linked to Ayushman Bharat Digital Health Mission

* **Training Frontline Workers:** Focus on meaningful interaction rather than mere documentation

* **Link with PDS and DBT:** Encourage usage by linking benefits like nutrition kits

* **Monitor Quality:** Include periodic audits of MCP card usage and accuracy

---

### **🔹 Prelims Focus Points**

* **What is MCP Card?**: A health record tool for mother and child

* **Covers:** Pregnancy → childbirth → immunization → child growth

* **Jointly by:** MoHFW & MoWCD

* **Linked Schemes:** JSY, PMMVY, Poshan Abhiyaan, ICDS

* **Problem:** Low awareness in rural India

* **Recent Update:** Calls for wider awareness and digitization

## **India’s Coastline and the ‘Coastline Paradox’ – Scientific Explanation Behind Length Increase**

---

### **1\. Basic Understanding**

**What is the “Coastline Paradox”?**

* It is a **mathematical/geometric concept** that states:  
   *“The length of a coastline depends on the scale of measurement.”*

* The finer the scale (smaller measuring unit), the longer the measured length becomes because **coastlines are irregular and fractal-like**.

**Who formulated it?**

* Introduced by **Lewis Fry Richardson**, later formalized by **Benoît Mandelbrot**, father of fractal geometry.

**Why is this relevant now?**

* India recently revised its official coastline from **7,516.6 km to 11,098.8 km** due to **high-resolution digital measurement**.

---

### **2\. The News**

* **What happened?**  
   Scientists at the **National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management (NCSCM)** explained the dramatic jump in coastline length using the **coastline paradox**.

* **Why the increase?**

  * Traditional mapping used lower resolution.

  * New maps are at **1:5,000 scale**, using **satellite imaging, GIS, and LIDAR** to capture every inlet, bay, estuary, and island curve.

* **When?**  
   Report released in May 2025\.

---

### **3\. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **NCSCM (under MoEFCC):** Conducted scientific mapping using advanced tools.

* **National Coastal Mission:** Encourages scientific data in policy planning.

* **CRZ (Coastal Regulation Zone) Notifications:** May be revised based on new coastline data.

* **Blue Economy & Sagarmala Projects:** Heavily dependent on accurate coastal mapping.

* **National Marine Spatial Planning Framework:** Uses coastline data for planning fishing, tourism, industry zones.

---

### **4\. Mains Relevance**

**Issues and Challenges:**

* **Policy Lag:** CRZ and disaster vulnerability maps still based on old coastline

* **State-Level Variation:** States like Gujarat have highly irregular coastlines – paradox more visible there

* **Risk of Encroachment:** Longer coast \= more human activity \= higher regulation needed

* **Jurisdiction Conflicts:** Maritime boundaries, EEZ calculations, and international treaty claims (e.g., UNCLOS) affected

**Impacts:**

* **Scientific:** Brings India in line with global mapping standards

* **Economic:** Influences **port planning, maritime trade, fishing zones**

* **Disaster Management:** Better risk zoning for **tsunamis, cyclones, erosion**

* **Environmental:** Helps protect mangroves, estuaries, and turtle nesting zones

**Ethical/Governance Aspect:**

* Use of scientific data for public good

* Ensuring **transparency and access** to new maps for planners and communities

* Avoiding misuse of data for real estate lobbying

---

### **5\. Way Forward**

* **CRZ Map Revision:** Reassess all existing buffer zones using updated coastline data

* **Awareness Training:** For local officials, fisherfolk, and disaster personnel

* **Legal Alignment:** Update laws using new length for EEZ, port limits, and pollution zones

* **Use in Education & Urban Planning:** Make the paradox part of geography curriculum; use maps in town planning

* **Cross-Institution Collaboration:** NCSCM, ISRO, Hydrographic Office, and IMD must align standards and share data

---

### **🔹 Prelims Focus Points**

* **What is Coastline Paradox?**  
   A coastline appears longer as the scale of measurement becomes finer

* **Old vs. New Length:**

  * Old: 7,516.6 km

  * New: 11,098.8 km

* **Key Body:** NCSCM (MoEFCC)

* **Tools Used:** GIS, Remote Sensing, LIDAR

* **Mapped at Scale:** 1:5,000

* **Relevance:** CRZ, EEZ, Sagarmala, Blue Economy, Disaster Management
