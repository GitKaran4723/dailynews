## **ISRO Tests Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) Successfully**

### **1\. Basic Understanding**

#### **a. What is a Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV)?**

* A type of **space launch system** designed to **return to Earth safely and be reused** for multiple missions.

* Helps significantly **reduce launch costs**, similar to SpaceX‚Äôs Falcon rockets.

#### **b. Why RLVs Matter:**

* Traditional launch vehicles are **expendable** (used once).

* Reusability improves **cost-efficiency**, **turnaround time**, and supports **sustainable space missions**.

* Key for developing **low-cost space tourism** and **commercial satellite launches**.

#### **c. About ISRO:**

* **Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)** is India‚Äôs premier space agency.

* Known for budget-friendly missions like **Chandrayaan**, **Mangalyaan**, and **Gaganyaan (in progress)**.

---

### **2\. The News**

* **When**: May 2025\.

* **What Happened**:

  * ISRO successfully conducted a **landing test** of its Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV-TD) in **Chitradurga, Karnataka**.

  * The vehicle performed a **precise autonomous horizontal landing** after being released from a helicopter.

  * This is a **major milestone** in India‚Äôs roadmap for **space shuttle-like operations**.

---

### **3\. Government Interventions & Initiatives**
