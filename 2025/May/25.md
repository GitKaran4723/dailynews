## **Blue Light Increases Mutations in Yeast DNA – IISER Study**

### **1\. Basic Understanding**

* **What is Blue Light?**  
   Blue light is a high-energy, short-wavelength visible light (400–500 nm) emitted naturally by the sun and artificially by LEDs, phone/computer screens, etc.

* **What are Genetic Mutations?**  
   A mutation is a change in the DNA sequence of an organism. It can be neutral, beneficial, or harmful. Mutations can result in diseases or evolutionary changes.

* **What is Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)?**  
   LOH is a mutation where a diploid organism loses one allele at a gene locus, becoming homozygous. It can drive cancer or other disorders when tumor suppressor genes are lost.

* **Why is Yeast used in research?**  
   Yeast (like *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*) is a model organism with cellular processes similar to human cells, making it ideal for genetic studies.

---

### **2\. The News**

* **What Happened?**  
   Researchers at IISER Thiruvananthapuram found that exposure to blue light significantly increased the rate of **loss of heterozygosity (LOH)** in yeast.

* **Who was involved?**  
   Prof. Nishant K.T.’s lab, along with PhD scholars Nikilesh Vijayan, Sameer Joshi, and postdoc Praseetha Sarath.

* **Where and When?**  
   The study was published in the reputed journal *PLoS Genetics* in May 2025\.

* **Key Finding:**  
   The extent of genetic damage due to blue light was comparable to that caused by known chemical mutagens.

* **Implications:**  
   If similar results are found in humans, chronic exposure to blue light (e.g., from screens, bulbs) may be mutagenic and pose health risks.
