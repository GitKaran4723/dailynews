## **1\. Operation Sindoor & PM Modi’s Ceasefire Address**

### **1\. Basic Understanding**

* **Ceasefire Agreement (LoC):** Since 2003, India and Pakistan have maintained a ceasefire understanding at the Line of Control (LoC) to prevent cross-border hostilities.

* **Nuclear Blackmail:** The term refers to leveraging nuclear threats to deter adversary retaliation or gain geopolitical advantage.

* **Operation Sindoor:** A major Indian military operation launched on May 7, 2025, following the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians.

* **DGMO Talks:** Directors-General of Military Operations from both countries coordinate military-to-military communication to de-escalate situations.

### **2\. The News**

* On **May 13, 2025**, PM Modi, in his first address since Operation Sindoor, stated:

  * The operation is **still ongoing**, and the **cessation of hostilities** is only a “pause”.

  * India will **not tolerate nuclear blackmail** and will not differentiate between terrorists and their state sponsors (referring to Pakistan).

  * He emphasized a **“zero-tolerance” policy** against terrorism, referencing the 2016 surgical strikes and 2019 Balakot airstrikes.

  * Asserted that future talks with Pakistan would only be on **terrorism and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK)**.

* India and Pakistan’s DGMOs agreed to ensure **troop reduction** and continuation of a no-fire commitment.

* U.S. President Trump claimed credit for averting a “nuclear conflict”, though PM Modi sidestepped these claims.

### **3\. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Surgical Strike Doctrine (2016)** and **Balakot Doctrine (2019)** — underline India's proactive counter-terrorism strategy.

* **Indus Waters Treaty Re-evaluation**: India has considered relooking at water-sharing treaties post-terror attacks.

* **Defence Modernization**: Continued focus on operational readiness of tri-services (Army, Navy, Air Force).

* **Counter-Terror Diplomatic Outreach**: India has pursued international support to isolate Pakistan diplomatically post terror attacks.

### **4\. Mains Relevance**

#### **Issues and Challenges:**

* **Cross-border Terrorism** remains a core bilateral challenge.

* **Credibility vs Escalation**: Balancing effective retaliation with risk of nuclear escalation.

* **Third-Party Mediation Concerns**: Trump's statement hints at unwanted external influence, undermining India’s stated position of bilateralism (Shimla Agreement).

#### **Impact:**

* **Polity**: Reinforces the government’s muscular national security narrative.

* **Economy**: Positive market response; Sensex and Nifty surged (\~4%) after de-escalation.

* **Diplomacy**: Reveals fault lines between India’s sovereign posture and global realpolitik.

#### **Ethical/Governance Aspects:**

* **Transparency vs National Security**: Public communication vs operational confidentiality.

* **Misuse of Social Media**: Trolling of Foreign Secretary Misri raises issues of public accountability and digital conduct in sensitive matters.

### **5\. Way Forward**

## **2\. WTO & India’s Stand on Agriculture MSPs**

### **1\. Basic Understanding**

* **WTO (World Trade Organization):** A global institution that regulates international trade; ensures smooth flow of goods and services.

* **Minimum Support Price (MSP):** A government-set floor price to protect farmers from distress sales.

* **Agreement on Agriculture (AoA):** WTO’s treaty (1995) that disciplines trade in agricultural products; includes:

  * **Domestic Support (Subsidies)**

  * **Market Access (Tariff cuts)**

  * **Export Competition (Subsidies, dumping)**

* **De Minimis Limits:** WTO allows developing countries to give up to **10% of the value of agricultural production** as subsidies; exceeding this attracts penalty unless a **peace clause** is invoked.

### **2\. The News**

* On **May 13, 2025**, India formally reiterated at the **WTO Geneva** meeting:

  * It will **continue MSP-based procurement** for food security.

  * India has invoked the **Peace Clause** (2013 Bali Agreement) for rice procurement that exceeded de minimis limits.

  * India criticized WTO rules as **unfair to developing nations**, particularly on food stockpiling and subsidy limits.

* India emphasized:

  * Need for a **permanent solution** on public stockholding.

  * Protection of **food security programs** of developing nations.

### **3\. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Global North vs Global South Divide**: Conflict over fair agricultural trade practices.

#### **Impact:**

* **Food Security**: WTO limits threaten India’s large-scale PDS and buffer stocking.

* **Diplomacy**: Potential friction with WTO and developed countries like US, EU.

* **Farmer Welfare**: Uncertainty on MSP could affect farmers’ income security.

#### **Ethical & Governance Aspects:**

* **Right to Food vs Trade Rules**: Ensuring constitutional rights vs international commitments.

* **Equity**: WTO norms may ignore development needs of poorer countries.

### **5\. Way Forward**

* **Negotiate Permanent Peace Clause**: Lead developing blocs (G33) for a lasting resolution on public stockholding.

* **Reform WTO’s AoA**: Push for reclassification of subsidies, fairer rules on food security.

* **Domestic Reforms**: Improve procurement efficiency, reduce waste, diversify crops.

* **Alliances with Global South**: Build consensus with African, Latin American nations for a common food security front.

---

### **Prelims Pointers**

* **WTO’s De Minimis Limit**: 10% for developing countries.

* **Sovereignty vs Collective Security:** Baltic neutrality is eroding, pushing Europe into new Cold War-like dynamics.

#### **Impact:**

* **Geopolitics:** Strengthens NATO’s deterrence but polarizes East-West relations further.

* **Maritime Security:** Strategic chokepoints (like Kaliningrad) become high-tension zones.

* **Energy Supply Chains:** Naval activity may threaten undersea pipelines and fiber-optic infrastructure.
