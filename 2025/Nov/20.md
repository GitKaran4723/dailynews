# India’s Russian oil cuts predate U.S. tariffs: data
## India’s Strategy to Reduce Dependence on Russian Oil

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Oil Import Dependence:** India imports over 85% of its crude oil needs. Thus, diversification of suppliers is crucial for energy security.
* **Russian Oil Post-Ukraine War:** After the 2022 Russia–Ukraine conflict, Russian crude was available at discounted rates because of Western sanctions. India became one of the largest buyers.
* **Tariffs by the U.S.:** In 2025, the U.S. imposed a *50% tariff* on Indian exports as a penalty for India’s continued purchase of Russian oil.
* **Energy Security Strategy:** Overdependence on any one country — especially one under sanctions — exposes India to geopolitical risks, supply fluctuations, and diplomatic pressure. Hence, diversification is a long-term strategic objective.

### 2. **The News**

* India has been *systematically reducing* its crude oil imports from Russia **even before** the U.S. increased tariffs in August 2025.
* In **September 2025**, the first full month after the U.S. tariff hike:

  * Imports from Russia were **29% lower in value** and **17% lower in volume** compared to September 2024.
* Between late 2024 and September 2025, India reduced the value of Russian oil imports in **8 out of 10 months**, with reductions above **20%** in February, May, June, July, and September 2025.
* Government officials confirmed that this reduction is part of a **larger, pre-existing strategy**, not a direct reaction to U.S. punitive tariffs.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Diversification of Oil Sources:** Increasing imports from Middle Eastern countries, the U.S., Latin America, and Africa.
* **Long-term Supply Agreements:** Negotiations with Saudi Arabia, UAE, Iraq, and U.S. shale producers for stable supply.
* **Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR):** Expansion plans to protect India from supply shocks.
* **Policy Push for Renewable Energy:**

  * National Green Hydrogen Mission
  * Faster deployment of solar and wind energy
  * Ethanol blending programme (20% target)
* **Diplomatic Engagement:** Balancing strategic autonomy — maintaining ties with Russia while preventing overdependence and managing Western pressure.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

**a. Issues and Challenges**

* **Geopolitical vulnerability:** Overreliance on discounted Russian oil risked India’s ties with Western partners, especially during sanctions.
* **Economic exposure:** Sudden supply disruptions or changes in global oil prices could impact India’s inflation and fiscal deficit.
* **Tariff impact:** U.S. tariffs act as diplomatic pressure tools, potentially affecting India’s exports and wider trade relations.

**b. Impact on Economy**

* Reduced Russian oil may slightly increase crude prices for India, affecting:

  * Refinery margins
  * Petroleum product prices
  * CAD (Current Account Deficit)

**c. Strategic and Diplomatic Implications**

* Shows India’s assertion of *strategic autonomy* while simultaneously addressing Western concerns.
* Strengthens India’s narrative of being a responsible global actor balancing multiple interests.

**d. Governance/Ethical Angle**

* Prioritisation of long-term energy security over short-term profit.

# SC quashes provisions of Tribunal Reforms Act
## Supreme Court Strikes Down Provisions of the Tribunal Reforms Act, 2021

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **What are Tribunals?**
  Tribunals are quasi-judicial bodies created to deal with specialised disputes (e.g., NCLT, CAT, Income Tax Appellate Tribunal). They reduce the burden on regular courts and offer subject-matter expertise.

* **Why were they reformed?**
  Over the years, multiple Supreme Court judgments — *R. Gandhi (2010)*, *Madras Bar Association cases*, *Roger Mathew (2019)* — emphasised that tribunals must remain independent from executive control.
  The Tribunal Reforms Act, 2021 attempted to change rules regarding tenure, appointments, and qualifications — areas where the Court had earlier set constitutional limits.

* **Constitutional Concern:**
  **Judicial independence** is a basic feature of the Constitution. Tribunals often perform judicial functions, so excessive executive control violates separation of powers.

### 2. **The News**

* On **Wednesday**, the **Supreme Court** struck down specific provisions of the **Tribunal Reforms Act, 2021**.
* The Court held that these provisions **gave the Union government disproportionate control** over:

  * appointment of tribunal members,
  * tenure and service conditions,
  * and overall functioning of tribunals.
* The Court stated:
  *“When Parliament designs or alters the tribunal system, it must do so in a manner consistent with independence, impartiality, and effective adjudication.”*
* It emphasised that provisions enabling executive dominance “strike at the core of the constitutional arrangement.”

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Tribunal Reforms (Rationalisation and Conditions of Service) Act, 2021:**
  Aimed to reduce the number of tribunals, streamline appointments, and bring uniformity in service conditions.
* **Introduction of Search-cum-Selection Committee:**
  But the Act allowed the government to have a greater say, diluting judicial participation.
* **Earlier Reforms:**

  * Finance Act, 2017, which reorganised tribunals
  * Delegated legislation via rules on appointments and tenure
* **Supreme Court interventions:**
  Multiple judgments already struck down provisions related to:

  * short tenure (3 years)
  * age limits
  * high executive presence in selection committees
* Government has been working toward a more centralised tribunal system, but the Court consistently insisted on *judicial independence*.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

**a. Issues & Challenges**

* **Executive dominance:** Violates separation of powers and allows potential interference in quasi-judicial decision-making.
* **Short tenures:** Affect independence and discourage experienced professionals from joining.
* **Lack of autonomy:** Impacts efficiency, public trust, and fairness.
* **Constitutional challenge:** Tribunals are meant to be substitutes for High Courts in many cases — hence they must be as independent as constitutional courts.

**b. Impacts**

* **Strengthens judicial independence:** Reasserts that tribunals must mirror constitutional safeguards of courts.
* **Limits executive overreach:** Reinforces checks and balances.
* **Improves adjudicatory quality:** Independent tribunals ensure unbiased, effective dispute resolution.
* **Policy implications:** Government will need to redesign tribunal structures in line with judicial directions.

**c. Governance/Ethical Dimensions**

* Independence ensures **fair hearing** and **rule of law**.
* Prevents conflict of interest when the government is itself a litigant in many tribunals.
* Helps maintain public trust in justice delivery.

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Reform tribunal appointments in line with SC judgments**
   Ensure majority judicial presence in selection committees, transparent criteria, and fixed minimum tenure.

2. **Strengthen institutional autonomy**
   Give tribunals independent control over finances, staffing, and administration.

3. **Harmonise statutes**
   Bring all tribunal-related laws in sync with constitutional principles and past SC verdicts to avoid repeated litigation.

4. **Improve working conditions and infrastructure**
   Better pay scales, security of tenure, and modern facilities to attract competent members.

5. **Ensure minimal executive interference**
   Maintain clear separation between administration and adjudication to protect impartiality.

# The threat of digital tradecraft in terrorism
## Red Fort Blast: Rise of Digitally Sophisticated Terror Modules

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Modern Terrorism:**
  Terrorist groups today increasingly combine **traditional physical planning** (reconnaissance, logistics, weapons) with **advanced digital tradecraft** (encrypted apps, VPNs, metadata evasion).
  This makes tracking, intercepting, and dismantling modules far more complicated.

* **Encrypted Communication:**
  Apps with **end-to-end encryption (E2EE)** prevent third parties from reading messages. Some, like **Threema**, even avoid conventional identifiers (phone numbers, email), making users anonymous.

* **Dead-Drop Emails:**
  A technique where multiple users log into the same email account and communicate through unsent drafts.
  This avoids a message trail and is difficult to detect through ordinary surveillance.

* **Operational Security (OpSec):**
  Terror cells increasingly adopt spy-style methods:

  * Using VPNs
  * Avoiding digital footprints
  * Periodic shutdown of devices
  * Self-hosting servers
    These methods reflect academic findings on “multi-domain terror networks.”

### 2. **The News**

* On **November 10, 2025**, a deadly explosion near **Gate No. 1, Red Fort Metro Station, Delhi** killed **15 people** and injured over **30**.
* Authorities quickly treated it as a **terrorist attack**, assigning the probe to the **National Investigation Agency (NIA)**.
* Three doctors from **Al Falah University** — Dr. Umar Un Nabi, Dr. Muzammil Ganaie, and Dr. Shaheen Shahid — are alleged to be key conspirators.
* Investigators uncovered:

  * Use of **Threema**, possibly on a **private self-hosted server**.
  * Use of **dead-drop email drafts** for communication.
  * Multiple recce visits and **ammonium nitrate** stockpiling.
  * Evidence suggesting **possible linkages to Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM)**.
  * Strict operational discipline, including “switching off phones,” minimising digital presence.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **National Investigation Agency (NIA):**
  India’s premier counter-terror agency handling the case using its cyber forensics and inter-agency network.

* **Section 69A, IT Act, 2000:**
  Enables blocking of digital platforms that threaten national security (Threema is reportedly banned), though enforcement challenges persist.
