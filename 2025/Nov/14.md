# Urgent update
## **Need for Updating India’s CPI: October Inflation Data Highlights**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

**Consumer Price Index (CPI):**

* A measure that tracks the average change over time in the prices of a basket of goods and services consumed by households.
* Used to gauge inflation — the rise in general price levels.
* India’s CPI basket is currently based on the **2012 base year**, with weightages assigned to various consumption categories (e.g., food, clothing, housing, fuel).

**Inflation Types:**

* **Headline Inflation:** Overall CPI-based inflation.
* **Core Inflation:** Excludes food and fuel (volatile components).
* **Base Effect:** When inflation appears abnormally high or low due to unusually high or low price levels in the previous year. A high base leads to lower inflation even if prices are rising.

**Why CPI Matters:**

* Acts as the **anchor for the RBI’s monetary policy**, especially the inflation-targeting framework.
* Influences interest rates, borrowing costs, savings, and investment.

---

### **2. The News**

* **October 2025 CPI inflation fell sharply to 0.25%**, the lowest since the CPI series began in 2012.
* This fall **appears misleading**, as it is mainly due to the **base effect**, not due to an actual drop in prices.
* **Food and beverages inflation was –3.7%**, the lowest ever recorded in the current CPI series.
* But this decline happened because **food inflation in October 2024 was extremely high (9.7%)**, creating a high base.
* Despite this, **many other CPI sub-groups showed higher inflation** compared to last year:

  * Fuel & light
  * Housing
  * Tobacco
  * Miscellaneous
* Only **clothing and footwear** showed a genuine decline due to **GST rate cuts**.
* A significant **gap exists between CPI inflation (0.25%) and perceived inflation (7.4%)**, as per an RBI survey.
* The outdated **2012 base year and incorrect basket weightages** are distorting inflation measurement.
* A new CPI series is expected by **Q1 of the next financial year**, as stated by the Ministry of Statistics.

---

### **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **CPI Revision Mechanism:** Handled by the Ministry of Statistics & Programme Implementation (MoSPI).

  * Regular updates are planned but the current update is delayed.
* **Inflation Targeting Framework (2016):**

  * MPC mandated to maintain **4% ± 2%** inflation.
  * CPI is the anchor indicator.
* **Recent GST Rate Cuts** reducing inflation in the clothing-footwear segment.
* **Food inflation management measures:**

  * Buffer stocks via FCI
  * Minimum Export Price / export bans on staples during high inflation
  * Price stabilisation fund for onions, pulses, potatoes
* **Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES)** updates, which will recalibrate CPI weights.

---

### **4. Mains Relevance**

#### **Issues & Challenges**

1. **Base Year Outdated (2012):**
   Consumption patterns have changed drastically — higher services consumption, more processed foods, digital services, fuel usage patterns, etc.

2. **Weightages Do Not Reflect Reality:**

   * Food’s share (46%) is considered too high for urban India.
   * New categories like OTT subscriptions, digital payments, and app-based transport are missing.

3. **Statistical Anomalies Due to Base Effects:**
   October 2025 data shows inflation dropping artificially, masking genuine price pressures.

4. **Disconnect between CPI & Public Perception:**
   CPI at 0.25% vs perceived inflation at 7.4% indicates measurement failure.

5. **Policy Implications:**
   The RBI’s MPC risks making wrong interest rate decisions:

   * If it reads inflation as too low, it may cut rates prematurely.
   * Could fuel asset bubbles or create instability.

6. **Fiscal Planning Challenges:**
   Budget estimates for subsidies, pensions, and fiscal deficits depend on accurate inflation numbers.

#### **Impacts**

* **Economic:** Misleading inflation data affects monetary policy, growth, savings, investment.
* **Social:** Erodes trust in official data if everyday experiences differ from reported inflation.
* **Governance:** Weakens evidence-based policymaking.
* **Political:** Inflation is electorally sensitive; inaccurate measurement can distort public discourse.

---

### **5. Way Forward**

1. **Immediate Updating of CPI Base Year**

   * Move from 2012 to a more recent year using the latest Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (2022–23).
   * Reflect current consumption habits (e.g., digital services, processed foods).

2. **Revised Weightages for Rural and Urban India**

   * Reduce overweighting of food in urban CPI.
   * Add new categories reflecting changing lifestyles and technology adoption.

3. **More Frequent Basket Revisions**

   * Global best practice: revise every 5 years.
   * India should adopt a structured revision cycle.

4. **Develop Complementary Inflation Indicators**

   * A modern “Cost of Living Index”.
   * Regional inflation indices for targeted policymaking.

5. **Enhance Transparency & Communication**

   * Explain base effects and data limitations to the public.
   * Improve statistical releases to reduce misunderstanding.

6. **Strengthen Price Collection Mechanisms**

   * Use real-time digital data from e-commerce platforms.
   * Reduce lags and improve regional representativeness.

# Amoral embrace
## **Syria Under Ahmed al-Sharaa (Abu Mohammed al-Golani): A Controversial Rebranding**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

**Background on Syria’s Civil War:**

* Began in 2011 as part of the Arab Spring.
* Involved the Assad regime, rebel groups, Kurdish forces, ISIS, and foreign powers (U.S., Russia, Iran, Türkiye).
* Radical jihadist groups like al-Qaeda and ISIS exploited the instability.

**Who is Ahmed al-Sharaa / Abu Mohammed al-Golani?**

* Originally a jihadist commander selected by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to establish **al-Qaeda in Syria** (Jabhat al-Nusra).
* Later split from Baghdadi when ISIS was formed.
* Led **Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS)**, which controlled Idlib and was accused of extremist activities, civilian repression, and targeted killings.
* Long carried a **$10 million U.S. bounty**.

**Shifting Regional Dynamics:**

* Middle Eastern geopolitics often involves alliances shifting based on security priorities, counter-terrorism, and the influence of U.S., Israel, Türkiye, and Russia.
* U.S. strategic interest: containing ISIS, limiting Iran’s footprint, securing Israel’s borders.

---

### **2. The News**

* **Ahmed al-Sharaa**, former al-Qaeda Syria chief and HTS leader, has become the **President of Syria** after toppling Bashar al-Assad in late 2024.
* In a dramatic diplomatic turn, he **visited the White House**, with U.S. President Donald Trump stating he “gets along with him”.
* Following his takeover:

  * U.S. **lifted the $10 million bounty** on him.
  * Provided **sanctions exemptions** for Syria.
  * Pressed Congress to **repeal the 2019 sanction law** on Syria.
  * Syria pledged to join the U.S.-led war on ISIS.
  * Mr. Sharaa expressed readiness to **improve ties with Israel** even as Israel expanded control over Golan territories.
* Reports indicate the U.S. is **enhancing its presence at a Damascus airbase**, possibly mediating a Syria–Israel security arrangement.
* Essentially, Mr. Sharaa is steering Syria into the **U.S.-led regional order**, and Washington is welcoming him.
* However, troubling developments include:

  * **Two massacres** against Alawites and Druze communities.
  * **Centralisation of power** through questionable elections.
  * Continued freedom for **transnational jihadists** in HTS.
  * Declining U.S. emphasis on **human rights concerns** that were once central to its criticism of Assad.

# The Tamil Nadu model of sub-State climate action
## **Tamil Nadu’s Climate Action Model: Local Innovation for a Net-Zero Future**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

**Climate Action & Net Zero:**

* *Climate action* refers to efforts aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and enhancing adaptive capacity.
* *Net Zero* means achieving a balance between GHG emissions produced and removed from the atmosphere.

**Why Subnational Climate Governance Matters:**

* States and districts are where **energy use, transport choices, land-use decisions, and local ecosystems** exist.
* Local-level climate planning enables targeted solutions rather than a uniform national strategy.

**Tamil Nadu Green Climate Company (TNGCC):**
A first-of-its-kind state-owned entity that coordinates climate initiatives through four missions:

1. **TN Climate Change Mission (TNCCM)** – emission reduction & climate resilience.
2. **Green Tamil Nadu Mission (GTNM)** – ecosystem and biodiversity restoration.
3. **TN Wetlands Mission (TNWM)** – protecting and rejuvenating wetlands.
4. **TN Coastal Restoration Mission (TN SHORE)** – safeguarding coasts, mangroves, and seascapes.

This structure allows integrated planning across mitigation, adaptation, natural ecosystems, and livelihoods.

# Holding up GLASS to India; securing stewardship to tackle AMR 
# **Antimicrobial Resistance in India – WHO GLASS 2025 Findings**
## **1. Basic Understanding**

### **What is Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)?**

* AMR occurs when **microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, viruses, parasites)** evolve to withstand drugs designed to kill them (antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals).
* This makes routine infections harder — or sometimes impossible — to treat.
* AMR increases:

  * Mortality
  * Hospital duration
  * Cost of healthcare
  * Risk of outbreaks

### **Global Frameworks**

* WHO’s **GLASS (Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System)** collects standardised resistance data from member countries.
* India joined **GLASS in 2017**.

### **Why AMR is dangerous**

* Can turn minor infections into fatal illnesses.
* Limits options for surgeries, ICU care, cancer treatment, and organ transplants.
* Particularly threatens **low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)** with high infectious disease burdens.

---

## **2. The News**

* **WHO’s GLASS 2025 report** warns that **AMR in India is among the highest globally**.
* Key findings:

  * In **2023**, *1 in 3 bacterial infections* in India were resistant to commonly used antibiotics.
  * Globally, *1 in 6* infections showed resistance.
* High resistance found in:

  * **E. coli**
  * **Klebsiella pneumoniae**
  * **Staphylococcus aureus**, especially in ICUs.

### **Aggravating Factors in India**

* Over-the-counter (OTC) antibiotic access.
* Self-medication, incomplete antibiotic courses.
* Environmental contamination (pharma waste, hospital discharge).
* Insufficient enforcement of Schedule H1.
* Gaps in surveillance, especially in rural & primary healthcare.

### **Surveillance Findings**

* India’s surveillance networks:

  * **ICMR AMRSN / i-AMRSS**
  * **NCDC NARS-Net**
* These networks rely heavily on **tertiary hospitals**, leading to **overestimation** of national resistance levels since they handle the sickest patients.

### **Kerala emerges as a model**

* The **Kerala AMR Strategic Action Plan (2018)** actively operationalises the National Action Plan.
* **AMRITH (2024)** initiative stopped OTC sale of antibiotics.
* Latest antibiogram shows a *slight dip* in AMR.

### **Global calls**

* WHO urges better surveillance, rational antibiotic use, stricter regulation, and One-Health integration.

## **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

### **A. National Framework**

1. **National Action Plan on AMR (NAP-AMR) – 2017**

   * Aim: One Health approach, surveillance, stewardship, infection prevention.
   * Progress: Very slow; few States operationalised SAP-AMR.

2. **Schedule H1 Regulation**

   * Restricts OTC sale of antibiotics, but enforcement remains weak.

3. **ICMR’s AMR Surveillance Networks**

   * AMRSN (formed in 2013)
   * i-AMRSS (digital reporting tool)

4. **Food Safety & Standards Authority of India (FSSAI)**

   * Regulates antibiotic use in food-producing animals.

5. **Colistin Ban (2019)**

   * Banned as a growth promoter in animal husbandry.
   * Positive impact expected, though long-term data needed.

### **B. State-Level Interventions (Kerala Model)**

* **2018 SAP-AMR** focusing on multisector collaboration.
* **AMRITH (2024):** Strict action against OTC antibiotic sales.
* State aims for **100% antibiotic literacy by Dec 2025**.
* Notable *decline in resistance* in recent antibiograms.

### **C. One Health Approach**

* Acknowledges links between:

  * Human health
  * Animal health
  * Environment
* Required for sustainable containment of AMR.

### **D. Global Industry & Research Engagement**

* **AMR Industry Alliance**: promotes R&D, equitable access, and responsible manufacturing.
* New antibiotics in development:

  * 97 candidates (2023) vs 80 (2021).
  * Only a few target WHO’s “critical priority pathogens”.

## **4. Mains Relevance**

### **A. Issues & Challenges**

#### **1. Surveillance Gaps**

* Over-reliance on tertiary hospitals → skewed data.
* Insufficient representation of rural, peri-urban regions.
* Limited participation from private sector and NABL labs.

#### **2. Weak Regulatory Enforcement**

* OTC antibiotics still common.
* Schedule H1 poorly enforced.
* Pharma waste management inconsistent.

#### **3. Healthcare System Challenges**

* Inadequate stewardship programmes.
* Limited microbiology labs & trained personnel.
* Infection prevention and control (IPC) practices inconsistent.

#### **4. Environmental Linkages**

* Untreated effluents from:

  * Pharma manufacturing units
  * Hospitals
  * Poultry and aquaculture

#### **5. Economic and Social Factors**

* High disease burden → high antibiotic use.
* Low awareness; antibiotics seen as quick fixes.
* Limited behaviour change among public.

#### **6. Pharmaceutical R&D Gaps**

* New antibiotics rare and expensive.
* Market failure → low incentives for pharmaceutical companies.

### **B. Impacts on Society, Economy, Health & Governance**

**Health:**

* Higher morbidity & mortality.
* Routine medical procedures become risky.

**Economy:**

* Loss of productivity.
* Increased treatment costs.
* Longer hospital stay → strain on healthcare budget.

**Society:**

* AMR hits the poor hardest.
* Delayed diagnosis & irrational medicine use worsen outcomes.

**Governance:**

* Weak coordination between ministries (health, animal husbandry, environment).
* Lack of accountability.

---

### **C. Ethical and Governance Concerns**

* Access vs overuse dilemma.
* Regulating private sector without harming patient access.
* Equity issues for rural and low-income patients.

---

## **5. Way Forward**

### **1. Strengthen Surveillance Networks**

* Expand beyond tertiary hospitals.
* Include:

  * 500+ NABL labs
  * District hospitals
  * Primary and community health centres
* Standardised antibiograms across states.

### **2. Intensify Regulation**

* Fully enforce **Schedule H1** (no OTC antibiotics).
* Strict monitoring of pharmaceutical and hospital waste.
* Regulate veterinary antibiotic use.

### **3. Expand State Action Plans**

* Replicate Kerala model in all states.
* Dedicated budget lines for AMR.

### **4. Improve Stewardship**

* Mandatory antibiotic stewardship programmes in all hospitals.
* Audit antibiotic use regularly.
* Promote diagnostic-led prescribing.

### **5. Public Awareness & Behaviour Change**

* National AMR literacy mission.
* School-level modules on microbes and antibiotics.
* Media campaigns with community leaders.

### **6. Encourage Research & Innovation**

* Incentivise development of novel antibiotics.
* Support public–private partnerships (PPP).
* Promote Indian biotech and academia collaborations.

### **7. Adopt One Health Approach**

* Integrate human, animal, food, and environment surveillance.
* Joint action across ministries.

### **8. Ensure Global Coordination**

* Align with WHO, FAO, OIE standards.
* Participate actively in global AMR financing mechanisms.
