# A Kerala story
## Kerala Eradicates Extreme Poverty: A Landmark in Human-Centred Development

---

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

**Extreme Poverty** refers to a condition where individuals or families lack the basic necessities for survival — food, shelter, healthcare, and means of livelihood. In global terms, the World Bank defines it as living on less than **$2.15 per day (PPP)**. In India, the **Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI)** — developed by NITI Aayog using parameters like **health, education, and standard of living** — is used to assess deprivation beyond income.

**Kerala’s Development Model**, often called the **“Kerala Model”**, emphasizes **human development indicators (HDIs)** such as literacy, healthcare, gender equality, and social welfare, rather than just economic growth. This model has made Kerala comparable to developed nations in terms of **social progress**, despite its modest per capita income.

# The case for energy efficiency
## India’s Clean Energy Paradox: Why the Grid Is Getting Dirtier Despite More Renewables

---

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

India’s **energy transition** is one of the most ambitious in the world — shifting from fossil fuels to **clean, renewable sources** like **solar, wind, hydro, and nuclear**. The country has achieved remarkable growth in renewable energy (RE) capacity: as of **June 2025**, non-fossil fuel sources account for **~50% of total installed capacity**.

However, a paradox has emerged: **India’s electricity is becoming more carbon-intensive**, not less. The **Grid Emission Factor (GEF)** — the amount of CO₂ emitted per megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity — has **risen from 0.703 tCO₂/MWh in 2020–21 to 0.727 tCO₂/MWh in 2023–24**, according to the **Central Electricity Authority (CEA)**.

This means that even though the country has installed more renewable capacity, the **actual electricity consumed** (generation) still relies heavily on **coal**, making the grid “dirtier.” Understanding this paradox requires grasping the **capacity–generation mismatch** and the role of **energy efficiency** in balancing the transition.

---

### 2. **The News**

* **What Happened:** Despite record renewable energy installations, India’s grid has become more carbon-intensive over the past five years.
* **Data:**

  * **GEF increased** from **0.703 → 0.727 tCO₂/MWh (2020–21 to 2023–24)**.
  * **Installed non-fossil capacity:** ~50% of total.
  * **Renewable share in electricity generation:** only **22% (2023–24)**.
* **Reason:**

  * Renewables like solar and wind have **low capacity utilisation (15–25%)**, while coal runs at **65–90%**.
  * **Electricity demand peaks at night**, when solar is unavailable, forcing **coal plants** to compensate.
  * Thus, although installed renewable capacity is large, **coal still delivers most of the electricity**.

This mismatch between **installed capacity** and **actual generation** — coupled with India’s **rapidly rising electricity demand** — is driving up emissions from the grid.

# Has cloud seeding been effective?
## Cloud Seeding in Delhi: Science, History, and India’s Experiments

---

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

**Cloud seeding** is a **weather modification technique** designed to induce or enhance rainfall by dispersing substances (usually salts) into clouds to encourage condensation and precipitation.

**Scientific Principle:**

* Clouds consist of **tiny water droplets or ice crystals** suspended in the atmosphere.
* These droplets are often too small to fall as rain unless they **aggregate or grow larger**.
* In cloud seeding, aircraft (or rockets) release **chemical agents** like **silver iodide, potassium iodide, sodium chloride, or calcium chloride** into suitable clouds.
* These particles act as **nuclei** around which moisture condenses or freezes, eventually forming **raindrops or snowflakes** that fall to the ground.

**Common Methods:**

1. **Aerial Seeding:** Aircraft release flares containing the seeding material into the cloud base or top.
2. **Ground-Based Seeding:** Rockets or generators release seeding agents that are carried upward by air currents.

**Typical Uses:**

* Enhancing rainfall in **drought-prone areas**.
* **Reducing smog** or dust by washing out pollutants.
* **Suppressing hail** or dispersing fog (especially around airports).

---

### 2. **The News**

* **Event:** For the first time in nearly 50 years, **Delhi conducted two cloud seeding trials** with the **Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IITK)**.

# What are the challenges with the High Seas Treaty?
## The High Seas Treaty (BBNJ Agreement): A Milestone for Global Ocean Governance

---

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

The **High Seas Treaty**, formally known as the **Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) Agreement**, is a landmark international treaty adopted under the **United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS, 1982)**.

It addresses a major legal gap: **how to govern and protect marine biodiversity** in the **“high seas”**, which lie **beyond any single nation’s jurisdiction** — roughly **two-thirds of the world’s ocean area** and **nearly half of the Earth’s surface**.

Until now, the high seas were largely **unregulated**, governed only by loose frameworks under UNCLOS. This led to problems such as:

* **Overfishing**
* **Marine pollution**
* **Deep-sea mining**
* **Climate change impacts**
* **Unregulated genetic resource extraction (“biopiracy”)**

The **High Seas Treaty** aims to ensure that **conservation and sustainable use** of marine biodiversity become binding global priorities through clear rules, equitable benefit-sharing, and environmental oversight.

---
