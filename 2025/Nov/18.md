## **Bangladesh Tribunal Sentences Former PM Sheikh Hasina 

---

## **1. Basic Understanding**

### **Crimes Against Humanity**

* These are grave violations such as murder, torture, enforced disappearances, or persecution committed as part of a *widespread or systematic attack* against civilians.
* Such crimes are usually tried under special tribunals or international mechanisms.

### **Special Tribunals**

* These are ad hoc judicial bodies formed to investigate and prosecute specific categories of crimes (e.g., war crimes tribunals, special courts for genocide or mass atrocities).
* They may operate outside the conventional judicial hierarchy and often work under special acts passed by the government or military authorities.

### **Bangladesh Political Context**

* Sheikh Hasina served multiple terms as Prime Minister and led the Awami League.
* Bangladesh has a history of political turbulence, protests, and strong state responses to dissent.
* Student uprisings have historically been central to Bangladesh’s political movements.

---

## **2. The News**

* On **Monday**, a **special tribunal in Bangladesh** sentenced:

  * **Former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina**
  * **Former Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal**
    **→ to death** for *crimes against humanity*.
* Charges relate to the **state crackdown on the student uprising** during **July–August 2024**, which eventually contributed to the fall of the Hasina government.
* **Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Mamun**, former Inspector-General of Police, turned a **state witness**:

  * He testified against Hasina and Khan.
  * He received **five years’ imprisonment** after admitting his role.
* Hasina rejected the judgment, stating:

  * She acted **“in good faith’’**, intending to minimise casualties.
  * The situation had gone out of control.
  * No orders were given to kill protesters.
  * The charges were **“unjustified’’** and **misinterpretations** of events.

* India’s foreign policy emphasises:

  * Stability in neighbourhood
  * Support for democratic institutions
  * Security cooperation (border management, counter-terrorism)

### **B. International Legal Mechanisms Relevant to Crimes Against Humanity**

* **Rome Statute** of the ICC (Bangladesh is a state party; India is not).
* **Universal Declaration of Human Rights**.
* **Bangladesh’s International Crimes (Tribunals) Act**, which was earlier used to prosecute 1971 war crimes.

### **C. Regional Mechanisms**

* SAARC lacks a human rights mechanism.

* When a country’s **imports exceed exports**, the difference is called a **trade deficit**.
  **Trade Deficit = Imports – Exports**
* A high deficit indicates:

  * Greater dependence on foreign goods.
  * Pressure on the domestic currency.
  * Potential vulnerabilities in external accounts.

### **Exports vs. Imports**

* **Exports:** Goods and services sold to other countries.
* **Imports:** Goods and services purchased from other countries.

### **Why Trade Deficit Matters**

* Affects the **Current Account Balance**.
* Influences the **value of the rupee**, forex reserves, and foreign investor confidence.
* Signals competitiveness of domestic industries.

---

## **2. The News**

* In **October 2025**, India’s **trade deficit surged 141%** to **$21.8 billion**.
* **Key numbers:**

  * **Exports:** $72.9 billion (slightly lower than $73.4 billion in October 2024)
  * **Imports:** $94.7 billion (higher than $82.4 billion in October 2024)
* **Reason for surge:**

  * Significant rise in **gold imports**, driven by **festival-season demand**.
  * Merchandise exports remained **subdued**.
* Consequently, the **trade deficit widened sharply** from **$9.05 billion** (Oct 2024) to **$21.8 billion** (Oct 2025).

# The lower judiciary — litigation, pendency, stagnation
# **Judicial Pendency & Subordinate Courts – Structural Problems & Reform Pathways**

## **1. Basic Understanding**

### **Judicial Pendency in India**

* India faces a **massive backlog** of cases:

  * **4.69 crore** cases pending in district courts (National Judicial Data Grid).
* Pendency arises due to:

  * High case inflow
  * Inadequate judge-to-population ratio
  * Procedural delays
  * Inefficient administrative systems
  * Lack of technological integration

### **Subordinate Judiciary**

* Includes **district courts**, **munsif courts**, **civil judges**, **magistrates**.
* They handle:

  * Bulk of civil and criminal cases
  * Summons, appearances, filing.
* They are the *foundation* of the justice system; delay here spills over across the system.

### **Code of Civil Procedure (CPC)**

* Governs procedure in civil trials.
* Contains mechanisms for:

  * Filing suits, summons, pleadings
  * Preliminary/final decrees
  * Executions
  * Appeals
* Many provisions are **archaic**, leading to delay.

### **Modern Challenges**

* Judges appointed without sufficient practical experience.
* Procedures (e.g., pre-suit mediation, cooling-off periods) sometimes increase delays instead of reducing them.

---

## **2. The News**

* A **Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court**, headed by the Chief Justice of India, linked:

  * **Stagnation in subordinate judiciary**
  * **Prolonged litigation & huge pendency**

* Another Bench observed:

  * Some Delhi judges lacked **basic legal knowledge**, prompting orders for **mandatory training**.

* Key statistics:

  * **4.69 crore cases pending** in district courts.

* Current problems noted:

  * Subordinate judges spend hours on **ministerial tasks** such as:

    * Issuing summons
    * Taking appearances
    * Receiving vakalathnamas
    * Listing orders
  * This reduces quality time for **hearing and deciding cases**.

* Suggested reforms:

  * A **separate judicial officer** at district level to handle all ministerial work.
  * Daily cause lists prepared centrally and shared online.
  * Judges to focus **exclusively on merits, trials, and judgments**.
  * Mandatory training under **High Court benches** for new judges.
  * Review provisions causing delays such as:

    * Section 12(A) of Commercial Courts Act (mandatory pre-suit mediation)
    * Six-month cooling-off period in mutual divorce cases
    * Ambiguities under new Rent Act
    * Complex execution procedures under Order XXI CPC
    * Dual-decree system in partition suits

2. **Promote mediation and arbitration** to prevent inflow.
3. **Vacancy filling** — High Courts often have 30–40% vacancies.

---

## **Conclusion**

Judicial pendency is not merely an administrative issue; it strikes at the heart of **access to justice** and the **rule of law**. The present observations of the Supreme Court highlight the urgent need to rethink procedures, rationalise outdated CPC provisions, improve judge training, reduce clerical burden, and adopt technological and structural reforms. Only a comprehensive overhaul can ensure **speedy, efficient, and quality justice** in India.

# The need for a social audit for SIR 2.0
## **Election Commission’s Special Intensive Revision (SIR) 2.0 and Concerns Over Electoral Integrity**

---

## **1. Basic Understanding**

### **What is the Electoral Roll?**

The electoral roll is the official list of all eligible voters in a constituency. It forms the foundation of elections, as only those whose names appear on this list can vote.

### **What is Special Intensive Revision (SIR)?**

The ECI periodically revises electoral rolls to add new voters (typically those turning 18), remove deceased voters, correct entries, and update details.
A **Special Intensive Revision** is an extraordinary, large-scale exercise beyond the routine annual revision.

* It involves re-verification of existing voters.
* It may require citizens to submit fresh documents.
* It is meant to ensure accuracy, but if conducted without clear rules and safeguards, it can risk exclusion.

### **Key Concepts**

* **Adult-Elector Ratio:** Ratio between total adult population and registered voters. A sudden decline indicates possible deletion of eligible voters.
* **Disenfranchisement:** Denial of voting rights to eligible citizens.
* **Ordinarily Resident (Section 19 & 20, RPA 1950):** A person must ordinarily reside in the constituency to be enrolled — but this definition is outdated for modern migration patterns.

---

## **2. The News**

The Hindu editorial raises concerns about the **Election Commission of India’s SIR 2.0**, launched in **12 States and Union Territories**, after observing serious issues in **Bihar**, where a Special Intensive Revision was recently conducted.

### **What happened in Bihar?**

* The SIR required residents to re-prove their eligibility, leading to:

  * A **sharp fall in adult-elector ratio**, suggesting mass deletions.
  * **Disproportionate removal of women and Muslims.**
  * **Duplicate names and bogus entries** — showing poor data quality.
* Citizens, civil society, and political parties fear that this may lead to **mass disenfranchisement**.
* Concerns that SIR resembles a **citizenship verification exercise**, not an electoral roll update.

### **Institutional Concerns**

* The ECI has defended the process aggressively but has appeared **non-transparent and unaccountable**.
* The **Supreme Court**, despite monitoring the issue, did not address the legality of SIR itself (i.e., whether ECI has the power to conduct such a process). It allowed the exercise to continue with minor procedural corrections.

### **Additional Issue: Migrant Voters**

* Tamil Nadu, with high migrant inflows, faces serious problems because:

  * The law’s definition of "ordinarily resident" does not fit current realities.
  * Migrants (seasonal, circular, or semi-permanent) often lose the right to vote either in their home constituency or workplace.

---

## **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

### **Legal Framework**

* **Representation of the People Act, 1950**

  * Section 19: Eligibility to be registered in the electoral roll.
  * Section 20: Meaning of “ordinarily resident”.

### **Institutional Mechanisms**

* **Election Commission of India:** Constitutionally mandated to prepare and revise electoral rolls.
* **Booth-Level Officers (BLOs):** Ground-level workers responsible for verification and updates.
* **Supreme Court:** Oversees legality but has limited its intervention in this instance.

### **Participatory Democracy & Social Audit**

* Article **243A** and **243J**: Empower the public to monitor and audit government activities at the local level.
* **CAG’s guidelines**: Recommend social audits for mass-based programmes.

### **Precedent of Social Audits in Elections**

* In **2003**, under CEC J.M. Lyngdoh, the ECI conducted **ward-level and gram sabha social audits**.
* In Rajasthan, it led to **7 lakh corrections**, demonstrating high public participation and accuracy.

---

## **4. Mains Relevance**

### **Issues and Challenges**

#### **a. Threat to Electoral Inclusion**

* Documentation-heavy processes can exclude:

  * Poor citizens
  * Women
  * Minorities (such as Muslims)
  * Migrants
* This affects the **universality** of adult franchise.

#### **b. Institutional Credibility**

* Perceptions of **partisanship or opacity** in the ECI reduce public trust.
* Defensive attitude of a regulatory body undermines democratic legitimacy.

#### **c. Judicial Oversight**

* Failure to address core legality creates a precedent for unchecked administrative processes.

#### **d. Migrant Voting Rights**

* Outdated definitions in Section 20 do not address:

  * Circular migrants (move frequently)
  * Seasonal workers (agriculture, construction)
  * Students and long-term workers
* Can lead to **double disenfranchisement**: they cannot vote either at home or workplace.

#### **e. Process Vulnerabilities**

* Lack of:

  * Clear rules
  * Audit trails
  * External oversight
  * Transparency

This makes the revision susceptible to **manipulation**, **political interference**, and **bureaucratic errors**.

### **Impacts**

* **Political:** Skewed voter lists can alter electoral outcomes.
* **Social:** Exclusion disproportionately affects vulnerable communities.
* **Ethical:** Violates the principle of equality and fairness.
* **Governance:** Weakens trust in democratic institutions.

---

## **5. Way Forward**

### **a. Mandatory Social Audits**

* Adopt **ward-level and booth-level social audits** as done in 2003.
* Community vetting ensures:

  * Transparency
  * Correction of errors
  * Minimization of exclusions
  * Collective ownership of the electoral process

### **b. Clear Rules for Special Revision**

* The ECI must frame detailed guidelines:

  * Documentation requirements
  * Verification standards
  * Error correction timelines
  * Grievance redress mechanisms
  * Independent oversight

### **c. Protecting Migrant Voting Rights**

* Amend Section 20 to include:

  * Short-term migrants
  * Circular migrants
  * Semi-permanent students/workers
* Explore:

  * **Remote voting technologies**,
  * **Mobile polling stations**,
  * **E-roll portability**.

### **d. Strengthening Institutional Accountability**

* Regular audits by:

  * Civil society
  * Independent observers
  * Constitutional bodies like CAG

### **e. Judicial Clarity**

* The Supreme Court should:

  * Clarify the legality of SIR
  * Issue procedural safeguards
  * Ensure that any revision exercise is rights-protective

### **f. Minimise Documentation Burden**

* BLO-driven verification rather than citizen-driven re-application.
* Use existing government databases (Aadhaar, ration cards, etc.) **only with privacy safeguards**.

# SC says perennial GRAP is not answer to Delhi air pollution
## **Supreme Court on Perennial GRAP & Long-Term Air Pollution Strategy**

---

## **1. Basic Understanding**

### **What is GRAP (Graded Response Action Plan)?**

GRAP is a set of emergency measures implemented in Delhi-NCR based on **Air Quality Index (AQI)** levels.
It includes actions such as:

* Banning construction activities
* Restricting industrial operations
* Halting diesel generator use
* Regulating vehicle entry

GRAP is **reactive**, triggered only when pollution crosses certain thresholds (e.g., “Severe”, “Severe+”).

### **Why is Delhi’s Pollution So Severe?**

Delhi’s winter pollution is caused by the convergence of multiple factors:

1. **Stubble burning** in Punjab and Haryana
2. **Vehicular emissions**
3. **Construction dust**
4. **Industrial pollution**
5. **Winter meteorology** — low wind speed, temperature inversion traps pollutants

### **Groundwater Preservation Act, 2009 (Punjab & Haryana)**

* Delayed sowing of paddy → delayed harvest.
* This leaves **very little time** between paddy harvest and wheat sowing.
* Result: Farmers burn stubble to quickly clear fields.

---

## **2. The News**

On Monday, the **Supreme Court** told the **Central Government** that applying **“perennial GRAP”** — i.e., emergency restrictions throughout the year — is **not a sustainable solution** to Delhi’s air pollution.

### **Key Points from the Hearing**

* **CJI D.Y. Chandrachud** stated that:

  * Year-round GRAP is *harsh* and disrupts livelihoods of lakhs of daily wage workers.
  * Pollution must be tackled through a **long-term, multi-stakeholder policy**, not short-term bans.

* **Centre’s View**

  * Even the Additional Solicitor General admitted that “knee-jerk reactions” can be counterproductive.

* **Suggestions & Observations**

  * Senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan suggested:

    * Year-round GRAP
    * Higher road tax on cars
    * Online functioning of courts
  * Amicus curiae Aparajita Singh highlighted linkage of stubble burning to the **2009 Groundwater Act**.
  * Proposal to **advance paddy harvest** so smoke doesn’t blow toward Delhi.

* **Financial Measures**

  * Centre allocated **₹2,000 crore** to Punjab, Haryana and other states for machines that convert stubble into manure or fuel.

* **Concerns Raised**

  * Merely allocating funds for machinery is not enough.
  * India’s AQI thresholds are far more lenient compared to international standards.
  * GRAP kicks in too late.

The Supreme Court asked the Centre to return on **Wednesday** with a reviewed position.

---

## **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

### **Key Policies**

1. **GRAP (2017 onwards)**
   Framework to manage Delhi-NCR pollution based on severity levels.

2. **National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), 2019**

   * Target: 40% reduction in PM2.5 and PM10 by 2026.
   * Covers 131 non-attainment cities.

3. **Subsidies for Stubble-Management Machinery**

   * Happy Seeder, Super Seeder, Rotavator.
   * Over ₹2,000 crore allocated for Punjab, Haryana, UP.

4. **Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM)**

   * Sets pollution-control directions specific to NCR.

5. **BS-VI Fuel Norms**

   * Cleaner vehicular emissions.

6. **Odd–Even Scheme (Delhi Government)**

   * Periodic vehicle restrictions.

7. **Electric Vehicle Policies**

   * FAME-II, state EV policies to reduce transport pollution.

---

## **4. Mains Relevance**

### **a. Issues and Challenges**

#### **1. Over-reliance on Emergency Measures**

GRAP is designed as a **crisis tool**, not a year-round policy.
A “perennial GRAP”:

* Halts construction → impacts migrant labourers
* Restricts industries → economic disruptions
* Limits vehicles → affects mobility and logistics

#### **2. Lack of Long-Term Structural Reforms**

* Crop diversification has not progressed.
* Stubble management remains expensive for farmers.
* Urban sprawl increases vehicle demand.
* Weak enforcement of dust and industrial norms.

#### **3. Coordination Failure**

Pollution is a **regional** issue:

* Punjab & Haryana’s agriculture
* UP’s industries
* Delhi’s transport and construction

But policies are often **fragmented**, with no unified action plan.

#### **4. Environmental Justice Concerns**

Emergency bans disproportionately affect:

* Daily wage labourers
* Migrant construction workers
* Informal sector workers

These groups have the least responsibility for pollution but face the worst economic impact.

#### **5. Regulatory Weaknesses**

* AQI thresholds in India are far higher than WHO guidelines.
* GRAP activation often happens too late.
* Monitoring systems and forecasting models have gaps.

---

### **b. Social, Economic, Environmental Impacts**

* **Social:** Health burden rises (respiratory diseases, children & elderly most affected).
* **Economic:** Productivity losses; construction and manufacturing shut-downs.
* **Environmental:** Soil degradation through stubble burning; high PM2.5 levels.
* **Governance:** Public frustration with ineffective, inconsistent measures.

---

## **5. Way Forward**

### **1. Shift from Crisis Response to Long-Term Strategy**

* Multi-year pollution reduction roadmap.
* Yearly targets for PM2.5 reduction, not just winter bans.

### **2. Reform Agriculture Practices**

* Promote **short-duration paddy varieties** to widen harvest window.
* Strengthen MSP or alternative incentives for crop diversification.
* Implement **value chain solutions** for stubble (biofuel plants, composting units).

### **3. Strengthen Regional Coordination**

* Revamp CAQM into a **statutory, empowered regional authority**.
* Regular inter-state meetings with enforceable timelines.

### **4. Improve AQI Standards & GRAP Thresholds**

* Bring Indian AQI closer to international health safety norms.
* Trigger GRAP earlier (preemptive, not reactive).

### **5. Protect Livelihoods**

* Provide:

  * Urban employment guarantee during shutdowns
  * Compensation for daily wagers affected by bans
  * Skill training for alternative work in winter months

### **6. Transform Urban Transport**

* Expand metro networks
* Promote EVs and charging networks
* Introduce congestion tax
* Strengthen public bus systems

### **7. Better Monitoring & Forecasting**

* Dense network of AQI sensors
* Use of satellite monitoring for stubble burning
* Real-time enforcement through drones

# Trade impacts of climate action flagged at COP30
## **Trade–Climate Tensions at COP30: India and Developing Countries Push Back**

---

## **1. Basic Understanding**

### **What is COP30?**

COP30 is the annual global climate conference under the **UNFCCC**, where countries negotiate collective actions to limit global warming, adapt to climate impacts, and mobilize finance and technology.

### **Why is Trade Becoming a Climate Issue?**

Climate policies increasingly influence international trade because:

* Countries are imposing **carbon taxes**, **border adjustments**, and **green standards**.
* These measures can become **non-tariff trade barriers**, especially affecting developing countries whose industries are more carbon-intensive.
* Developed countries argue these measures prevent “carbon leakage”.
* Developing countries see them as **unilateral trade restrictions** that violate principles of equity and CBDR-RC (Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities).

### **What is CBAM?**

The **EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism** is a carbon tax imposed on imported goods that emit more CO₂ than EU-produced equivalents.
It aims to:

* Prevent carbon leakage
* Encourage cleaner production globally

But it raises:

* Cost of exports from India and other developing countries
* Concerns about climate protectionism

---

## **2. The News**

At COP30, as ministerial-level negotiations begin, **developing countries including India** pushed for greater focus on the **impact of climate policies on international trade**.

### **Key Developments**

* The COP30 Presidency released a summary of country positions.
* Several developing countries demanded:

  * Annual dialogue on **unilateral, climate-related trade restrictions**.
  * Discussion on cross-border impacts of climate policies.
  * Round-table meetings in **2026 and 2027**, whose results should feed into the **Global Stocktake (2028)**.

### **Why this Concern?**

Unilateral trade measures like **CBAM** threaten:

* Export competitiveness
* Industrial growth
* Equity in climate responsibility

### **Carbon Leakage & 1.5°C Target**

Disagreements between developed and developing countries over trade-related climate measures may weaken collective climate action needed to prevent global warming from surpassing **1.5°C** by 2030.

### **India’s Position**

Environment Minister Bhupendra Yadav will highlight:

* **Finance gaps** for adaptation and mitigation
* The adverse impacts of trade-linked climate policies on developing economies

### **Forum for Climate and Trade Cooperation**

* Launched at COP30 by President Andrei Lago.
* Intended as a platform to bridge climate–trade tensions.
* Aim: A three-year process to address inequalities in climate-linked trade rules.

### **Impact on India**

* India will face major trade implications when **CBAM becomes fully operational in January 2026**.
* Iron & steel exporters may pay **€301 million (~₹3,000 crore)** annually in CBAM fees — the highest among all exporting countries.

---

## **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

### **India’s Engagement at COP**

* Advocates principles of **equity**, **CBDR-RC**, and **climate justice**.
* Highlights inadequate climate finance — only a fraction of the promised **$100 billion/year** delivered.

### **Domestic Preparedness for CBAM**

* MoEFCC, Commerce Ministry, and industry bodies are:

  * Mapping carbon intensity of Indian manufacturing
  * Promoting green hydrogen, renewable energy, and energy-efficient technologies
  * Preparing to challenge protectionist trade measures in WTO forums

### **International Platforms**

* BASIC group (Brazil, South Africa, India, China)
* G77 + China
* Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI)
* International Solar Alliance (ISA)

### **Relevant Treaties & Mechanisms**

* **Global Stocktake (GST)** – reviews global climate efforts every five years
* **UNFCCC principles** – equity, CBDR-RC
* **WTO rules** – non-discrimination, fair competition (CBAM likely to face challenges)

---

## **4. Mains Relevance**

### **Issues and Challenges**

#### **1. Climate Protectionism**

* Developed countries imposing unilateral standards like CBAM blur the line between:

  * legitimate climate action
  * disguised trade barriers
* This violates the spirit of **CBDR-RC**.

#### **2. Burden on Developing Economies**

* Industrial sectors (steel, cement, aluminium) are still fossil-intensive.
* High compliance costs weaken export competitiveness.
* Price-sensitive markets (like EU) may shift to cleaner suppliers.

#### **3. Finance and Technology Gaps**

* Developing countries lack:

  * affordable green technologies
  * concessional climate finance
  * R&D support

This makes decarbonisation slow and expensive.

#### **4. Diplomatic Fragmentation**

* Trade–climate disagreements weaken unity at COPs.
* Could hinder progress on achieving the **1.5°C pathway**.

#### **5. Equity and Climate Justice Concerns**

* Developed countries historically contributed most emissions.
* Yet developing countries bear the economic cost of strict trade-linked climate measures.

### **Impact on India**

* India’s iron, steel, aluminium, fertiliser, and cement exports to EU will be **directly taxed**.
* Jobs and MSMEs dependent on these sectors are at risk.
* Compliance requires massive investments in:

  * renewable energy
  * green hydrogen
  * energy-efficient manufacturing

---

## **5. Way Forward**

### **1. Strengthen Global Platforms for Trade–Climate Dialogue**

* Support the new **Forum for Climate and Trade Cooperation**.
* Push for:

  * transparency
  * early consultations
  * equitable climate-trade frameworks

### **2. Build a WTO-based Challenge to Unilateral Measures**

* India should explore:

  * dispute settlement
  * alliance-building with developing nations
  * claims that CBAM violates **most-favoured-nation (MFN)** and **national treatment principles**

### **3. Accelerate Domestic Decarbonisation**

* Incentivise:

  * green steel
  * renewable-based manufacturing
  * green hydrogen adoption
* Strengthen carbon markets under the **Energy Conservation Amendment Act**.

### **4. Expand Climate Finance Access**

* Push for:

  * concessional loans
  * climate risk transfer mechanisms
  * a reformed, realistic global climate finance architecture

### **5. Support Exporters**

* Create a **National CBAM Transition Fund**.
* Offer:

  * tax credits
  * technology upgradation subsidies
  * capacity-building support

### **6. Promote South–South Cooperation**

* Build coalitions with African, Latin American, and Asian countries to present unified positions at COP.

### **7. Advocate for Just Transition**

* Ensure climate action does not compromise:

  * jobs
  * livelihoods
  * competitiveness of developing country industries

# The trajectory of anti-rape laws in India
## **Mathura Rape Case, Institutional Failure & Evolution of India’s Rape Laws**

---

## **1. Basic Understanding**

### **What was the Mathura Rape Case (Tukaram v. State of Maharashtra, 1979)?**

A landmark custodial rape case involving a **14–16-year-old Adivasi girl, Mathura**, who was raped inside a police station in Maharashtra in 1972.
Despite clear indicators of coercion, the **Supreme Court acquitted the two policemen**, saying the sexual act appeared “consensual” because:

* She had no visible injuries
* She was “habituated” to sexual intercourse
* There was “no resistance”

This judgment became a symbol of **judicial patriarchy** and the **failure of the justice system** to understand consent.

### **Key Concepts**

* **Consent vs. Submission**:
  Consent is voluntary agreement; submission is often compliance under fear, authority, or coercion.
* **Custodial rape**:
  Rape committed by a person in a position of authority (police, jail staff, etc.).
* **Patriarchal judicial reasoning**:
  Linking consent to resistance, physical injury, or a woman’s sexual history (now illegal under Section 53A).

---

## **2. The News**

Forty-six years after the infamous acquittal, **Chief Justice of India B.R. Gavai** has publicly acknowledged that the 1979 judgment was a **“moment of institutional embarrassment”**.

### **Why now?**

The CJI said:

* The judgment reflected **deeply regressive and patriarchal attitudes**.
* It ignored **power dynamics, coercion, vulnerability**, especially in custodial settings.
* The verdict became a turning point that united the nation in protest and triggered India’s women’s rights movement.

### **Impact of the 1979 Judgment**

* Massive public uproar
* A famous 1979 open letter by four academics critiqued the judgment’s flawed logic
* Led to amendments strengthening rape laws
* Catalysed wider reforms including:

  * Dowry Prohibition Act strengthening
  * Establishment of Family Courts
  * Progressive jurisprudence on women’s rights

---

## **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

### **Legal & Policy Changes Triggered by the Mathura Case**

#### **A. Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1983**

* Introduced **custodial rape** as a separate offence (IPC 376(2)).
* Shifted **burden of proof** onto the accused when intercourse is established.
* Prohibited use of a woman’s past sexual history to determine consent.

#### **B. Vishaka Guidelines (1997)**

* Laid down the first framework against **sexual harassment at workplace**, following the gangrape of **Bhanwari Devi**.
* Became the foundation for the **POSH Act, 2013**.

#### **C. Post-Nirbhaya Reforms: Criminal Law Amendment Act, 2013**

* Expanded definition of rape
* Recognised non-penetrative acts and other forms of sexual violence
* Affirmed that **silence or a weak “no” is NOT consent**
* Raised age of consent from **16 to 18 years**
* Introduced penalties for:

  * Police not registering FIRs
  * Hospitals denying treatment

Also added:

* Voyeurism, stalking, acid attacks as new offences
* Death penalty for repeat offenders or cases causing death/vegetative state

#### **D. Criminal Law Amendment Act, 2018**

Triggered by the **Unnao and Kathua** cases.

* Death penalty for rape of children below 12
* Minimum 20 years for rape of minors under 16
* Fast-track investigation (2 months) and appeals (6 months)

#### **E. Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), 2023**

* Made sexual offences **gender-neutral**
* Punishment for gangrape of girls below 18: **death or life imprisonment**
* Introduced:

  * Sexual intercourse under false pretences
  * Wider definition of sexual harassment
  * More stringent penalties

---

## **4. Mains Relevance**

### **a. Issues, Challenges & Contextual Analysis**

#### **1. Patriarchal Judicial Reasoning**

* Judgments relied on:

  * Physical injuries as proof of rape
  * “Resistance test”
  * Victim’s past sexual history
* Ignored social realities of power, fear, coercion.

#### **2. Failure to Recognise Power Dynamics**

In custodial settings:

* Consent becomes legally invalid (position of authority → presumption of coercion).
  Yet Mathura judgment treated custodial setting like a normal situation.

#### **3. Role of Public Mobilisation**

* The Mathura case is a textbook example of how **civil society influences law**.
* Led to India’s earliest nationwide feminist legal mobilisation.

#### **4. Delay in Legislative Reforms**

* 11 years between case and custodial rape being criminalised
* Shows reactive rather than proactive lawmaking

#### **5. Evolution of Concept of Consent in Indian Law**

From requiring physical resistance →
To recognising coercion →
To explicitly defining consent (post-2013) →
To gender-neutral provisions (2023).

### **b. Societal & Governance Implications**

* Increased trust in legal institutions after reforms
* Recognition of women’s rights as human rights
* Need to sensitise judiciary and police
* Strengthening due process and victim protection mechanisms

---

## **5. Way Forward**

### **1. Judicial Sensitisation**

* Mandatory gender sensitisation for judges, prosecutors, and police.
* Understanding consent, power, vulnerability must be central.

### **2. Strengthening Policing Systems**

* Body cameras, CCTV in police stations
* Implementation of **Nandini Satpathy** principles:

  * Women should not be called to police stations
  * Female officers must be present

### **3. Victim-Centric Justice**

* Trauma-informed investigation
* Protection of identity
* Fast-track courts with psychological support systems

### **4. Legislative Clarity**

* Clarify concepts like:

  * “False promise of marriage”
  * Technology-enabled sexual offences
* Ensure consistency between POCSO, BNS, JJ Act

### **5. Reform Custodial Institutions**

* Independent oversight mechanisms (police complaints authorities)
* Zero tolerance approach for custodial crimes

### **6. Improve Implementation of Laws**

* Better training
* Monitoring conviction rates
* Ensuring timely investigation and trial

### **7. Strengthen Civil Society Engagement**

* The Mathura case shows the power of public discourse.
* Encourage community-led awareness on consent, gender rights, and legal remedies.
