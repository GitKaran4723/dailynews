## **Bangladesh Tribunal Sentences Former PM Sheikh Hasina 

---

## **1. Basic Understanding**

### **Crimes Against Humanity**

* These are grave violations such as murder, torture, enforced disappearances, or persecution committed as part of a *widespread or systematic attack* against civilians.
* Such crimes are usually tried under special tribunals or international mechanisms.

### **Special Tribunals**

* These are ad hoc judicial bodies formed to investigate and prosecute specific categories of crimes (e.g., war crimes tribunals, special courts for genocide or mass atrocities).
* They may operate outside the conventional judicial hierarchy and often work under special acts passed by the government or military authorities.

### **Bangladesh Political Context**

* Sheikh Hasina served multiple terms as Prime Minister and led the Awami League.
* Bangladesh has a history of political turbulence, protests, and strong state responses to dissent.
* Student uprisings have historically been central to Bangladesh’s political movements.

---

## **2. The News**

* On **Monday**, a **special tribunal in Bangladesh** sentenced:

  * **Former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina**
  * **Former Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal**
    **→ to death** for *crimes against humanity*.
* Charges relate to the **state crackdown on the student uprising** during **July–August 2024**, which eventually contributed to the fall of the Hasina government.
* **Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Mamun**, former Inspector-General of Police, turned a **state witness**:

  * He testified against Hasina and Khan.
  * He received **five years’ imprisonment** after admitting his role.
* Hasina rejected the judgment, stating:

  * She acted **“in good faith’’**, intending to minimise casualties.
  * The situation had gone out of control.
  * No orders were given to kill protesters.
  * The charges were **“unjustified’’** and **misinterpretations** of events.

* India’s foreign policy emphasises:

  * Stability in neighbourhood
  * Support for democratic institutions
  * Security cooperation (border management, counter-terrorism)

### **B. International Legal Mechanisms Relevant to Crimes Against Humanity**

* **Rome Statute** of the ICC (Bangladesh is a state party; India is not).
* **Universal Declaration of Human Rights**.
* **Bangladesh’s International Crimes (Tribunals) Act**, which was earlier used to prosecute 1971 war crimes.

### **C. Regional Mechanisms**

* SAARC lacks a human rights mechanism.

* When a country’s **imports exceed exports**, the difference is called a **trade deficit**.
  **Trade Deficit = Imports – Exports**
* A high deficit indicates:

  * Greater dependence on foreign goods.
  * Pressure on the domestic currency.
  * Potential vulnerabilities in external accounts.

### **Exports vs. Imports**

* **Exports:** Goods and services sold to other countries.
* **Imports:** Goods and services purchased from other countries.

### **Why Trade Deficit Matters**

* Affects the **Current Account Balance**.
* Influences the **value of the rupee**, forex reserves, and foreign investor confidence.
* Signals competitiveness of domestic industries.

---

## **2. The News**

* In **October 2025**, India’s **trade deficit surged 141%** to **$21.8 billion**.
* **Key numbers:**

  * **Exports:** $72.9 billion (slightly lower than $73.4 billion in October 2024)
  * **Imports:** $94.7 billion (higher than $82.4 billion in October 2024)
* **Reason for surge:**

  * Significant rise in **gold imports**, driven by **festival-season demand**.
  * Merchandise exports remained **subdued**.
* Consequently, the **trade deficit widened sharply** from **$9.05 billion** (Oct 2024) to **$21.8 billion** (Oct 2025).

# The lower judiciary — litigation, pendency, stagnation
# **Judicial Pendency & Subordinate Courts – Structural Problems & Reform Pathways**

## **1. Basic Understanding**

### **Judicial Pendency in India**

* India faces a **massive backlog** of cases:

  * **4.69 crore** cases pending in district courts (National Judicial Data Grid).
* Pendency arises due to:

  * High case inflow
  * Inadequate judge-to-population ratio
  * Procedural delays
  * Inefficient administrative systems
  * Lack of technological integration

### **Subordinate Judiciary**

* Includes **district courts**, **munsif courts**, **civil judges**, **magistrates**.
* They handle:

  * Bulk of civil and criminal cases
  * Summons, appearances, filing.
* They are the *foundation* of the justice system; delay here spills over across the system.

### **Code of Civil Procedure (CPC)**

* Governs procedure in civil trials.
* Contains mechanisms for:

  * Filing suits, summons, pleadings
  * Preliminary/final decrees
  * Executions
  * Appeals
* Many provisions are **archaic**, leading to delay.

### **Modern Challenges**

* Judges appointed without sufficient practical experience.
* Procedures (e.g., pre-suit mediation, cooling-off periods) sometimes increase delays instead of reducing them.

---

## **2. The News**

* A **Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court**, headed by the Chief Justice of India, linked:

  * **Stagnation in subordinate judiciary**
  * **Prolonged litigation & huge pendency**

* Another Bench observed:

  * Some Delhi judges lacked **basic legal knowledge**, prompting orders for **mandatory training**.

* Key statistics:

  * **4.69 crore cases pending** in district courts.

* Current problems noted:

  * Subordinate judges spend hours on **ministerial tasks** such as:

    * Issuing summons
    * Taking appearances
    * Receiving vakalathnamas
    * Listing orders
  * This reduces quality time for **hearing and deciding cases**.

* Suggested reforms:

  * A **separate judicial officer** at district level to handle all ministerial work.
  * Daily cause lists prepared centrally and shared online.
  * Judges to focus **exclusively on merits, trials, and judgments**.
  * Mandatory training under **High Court benches** for new judges.
  * Review provisions causing delays such as:

    * Section 12(A) of Commercial Courts Act (mandatory pre-suit mediation)
    * Six-month cooling-off period in mutual divorce cases
    * Ambiguities under new Rent Act
    * Complex execution procedures under Order XXI CPC
    * Dual-decree system in partition suits

2. **Promote mediation and arbitration** to prevent inflow.
3. **Vacancy filling** — High Courts often have 30–40% vacancies.

---

## **Conclusion**

Judicial pendency is not merely an administrative issue; it strikes at the heart of **access to justice** and the **rule of law**. The present observations of the Supreme Court highlight the urgent need to rethink procedures, rationalise outdated CPC provisions, improve judge training, reduce clerical burden, and adopt technological and structural reforms. Only a comprehensive overhaul can ensure **speedy, efficient, and quality justice** in India.
