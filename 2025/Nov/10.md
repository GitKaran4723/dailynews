### **1. Basic Understanding**

#### **a. Background**

* **Zohran Mamdani**, an American politician of Indian-Ugandan descent and member of the **New York State Assembly**, recently ran a **successful campaign for New York City Mayor**.
* Though operating in the **U.S. political context**, his campaign offers insights for **revitalising Opposition politics in India**, particularly regarding **communication, coalition-building, ideological clarity, and empathy-based engagement**.

#### **b. Broader Context**

* Both India and the U.S. face **deep political polarisation**, with **right-wing populism** gaining mass appeal.
* Mamdani’s campaign demonstrates how **progressive politics can win back disillusioned working-class voters** — not through moral outrage or elitist distance, but through **empathetic listening, concrete economic programmes, and persuasive communication**.

---

### **2. The News / Core Analysis**

#### **a. Central Message**

> Mamdani’s model of politics is not oppositional but constructive — blending **economic justice**, **cultural confidence**, and **strategic coalition-building**.

#### **b. Key Pillars of His Political Strategy**

1. **Empathy over Alienation**

   * Unlike the global Left’s tendency to dismiss right-wing voters as “irrational bigots,” Mamdani **listened empathetically** to Trump voters, identifying genuine grievances — economic precarity, high rents, poor transport, and child-care burdens.
   * This helped him build a **non-adversarial narrative**, grounded in shared socio-economic concerns.

2. **Economic Core with Ideological Clarity**

   * His agenda’s **bedrock was economic** — rent control, free public transport, universal childcare.
   * However, he also **upheld cultural and ideological values** — pluralism, democracy, and humane internationalism — thereby **avoiding reductionist “economics-only” politics.**
   * In contrast, Indian progressives often prioritise **abstract secularism or anti-communalism**, neglecting *bread-and-butter* issues of livelihood and inequality.

3. **Positive and Multi-layered Narrative**

   * Mamdani’s campaign avoided being *anti-Trump* or *anti-Cuomo*.
   * Instead of negative rhetoric, he presented a **coherent alternative vision**, using **reason, evidence, and optimism** — making his politics persuasive rather than reactive.

4. **Coalition-Building with Pragmatism**

   * Despite being a democratic socialist, Mamdani **won endorsements from centrist Democrats**, business leaders, and moderates — recognising that **broad coalitions are essential to win power**.
   * He **recalibrated controversial positions** — e.g., toning down “defund the police” rhetoric — without compromising core ideals.
   * This demonstrated a **balance between ideological authenticity and tactical flexibility**.

5. **Effective Political Communication**

   * Accepted the **financial disadvantage** of Left politics but innovated through **grassroots canvassing and social media**.
   * His **digital content humanised politics**, mixing humour, food, and relatable narratives with disciplined messaging.
   * This **restored trust** among voters alienated by technocratic or elitist communication.

6. **“Calling In”, Not “Calling Out”**

   * Mamdani refused the politics of contempt. Instead of “exposing” or “mocking” opponents, he **invited sceptics into conversation**, embodying *democratic persuasion* over *performative outrage*.

* The case originated from the **2016 suicide of Sushant Rohilla**, a student at Amity Law School, Delhi, who was **barred from writing exams due to attendance shortage**.
* The Delhi High Court, invoking *parens patriae* jurisdiction, converted the incident into a **public-interest inquiry** into whether attendance enforcement in universities met constitutional standards of **fairness, proportionality, and reasonableness**.

#### **b. Broader Context**

* The judgment arrives amid **increasing student suicides and stress-related mental health crises** in higher education.
* It examines the **interface between academic autonomy** and **constitutional accountability** — particularly how educational institutions must exercise discretion in a manner consistent with **Articles 14 and 21** of the Constitution.

---

### **2. The Core Issue Before the Court**

#### **a. Not Attendance, but its Enforcement**

* The **central issue** was not whether universities could set attendance requirements, but **how** they enforced them.
* The Court found that **mechanical and punitive application** of attendance rules — without notice, counselling, or opportunity to explain — **violated procedural fairness**.

#### **b. Constitutional Principles Involved**

* **Article 14:** Decisions by public universities must be **non-arbitrary**, reasoned, and proportionate.
* **Article 21:** Protects **life, dignity, and mental well-being** — encompassing a student’s right to fair treatment and humane academic processes.
* The Court thus constitutionalised **fairness in education governance**, linking administrative decisions to **human dignity** and **due process**.

---

### **3. Court’s Findings**

#### **a. Validity of Attendance Rules**

* The **Bar Council of India (BCI)**, under **Rule 12 of the Legal Education Rules (2008)**, has authority to mandate:

  * **70% minimum attendance**, relaxable to **65% in exceptional circumstances**.
* The Court **upheld this rule**, recognising its intent to ensure academic discipline and professional commitment.

#### **b. Critique of Rigid Enforcement**

* The Court held that **rigid and mechanical enforcement** — such as automatic debarment — was **disproportionate** and **constitutionally infirm**.
* Debarment, with severe academic consequences, cannot be imposed **without procedural safeguards**.
* The judgment urged the **BCI and UGC** to **revisit the framework** in light of:

  * **National Education Policy (NEP) 2020:** Promotes flexibility and holistic learning.
  * **UGC Regulations (2003):** Encourage learner-centred education and academic support mechanisms.

### **4. Procedural Safeguards Mandated**

Universities must now ensure **fairness and transparency** in attendance enforcement through:

| **Requirement**                                        | **Purpose**                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Weekly attendance updates**                          | Transparency; allows early intervention.                                               |
| **Monthly shortage notices to students and guardians** | Ensures awareness and remedial opportunity.                                            |
| **Counselling sessions**                               | Address academic or mental-health issues contributing to absenteeism.                  |
| **Alternative learning options**                       | Extra classes, home assignments, or academic activities (e.g., legal aid work, moots). |
| **Documentation of hardships**                         | Record illness, mental health issues, or family emergencies.                           |
| **Opportunity for representation**                     | Students must be heard before final debarment.                                         |

Only after **all remedial avenues** are exhausted may a university deny examination entry.
