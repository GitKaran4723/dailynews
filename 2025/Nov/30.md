# Ditwah-driven rain floods south T.N., damages crops
## **Cyclone Ditwah Brings Torrential Downpour to Tamil Nadu**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

Cyclones in the Bay of Bengal follow a predictable development pattern influenced by warm sea surface temperatures, low-pressure formation, and moisture-laden winds. Key concepts relevant here:

* **Cyclone Structure**: A rotating system with strong winds, intense rain bands, and a low-pressure centre.
* **Intensity Scale (India Meteorological Department)**:
  Depression → Deep Depression → Cyclonic Storm → Severe Cyclonic Storm → Very Severe Cyclonic Storm → Super Cyclone.
* **Parallel Coast Movement**: When a cyclone does not make landfall but moves near and parallel to the coast, it still brings heavy rains, storm surges, and strong winds.
* **Tamil Nadu’s Vulnerability**: Coastal and delta districts—Nagapattinam, Thanjavur, Cuddalore, Mayiladuthurai, Chennai—receive extreme rainfall due to northeast monsoon and cyclone interactions.

Understanding these principles is essential for interpreting Cyclone Ditwah’s behaviour and impacts.

# Why has Goa been asked to set up a tiger reserve?
## **CEC Recommends a Tiger Reserve in Goa: Context, Findings & Implications**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

#### **a) What is a Tiger Reserve?**

Under the **Wildlife Protection Act, 1972**, a tiger reserve consists of:

* **Core Zone**:
  Inviolate area meant exclusively for wildlife conservation; human settlements are offered voluntary relocation packages.
* **Buffer Zone**:
  Surrounds the core area; allows regulated human activity such as eco-tourism, agroforestry, and community-led conservation.

Tiger reserves get:

* Higher budgetary allocation
* Stricter protection mechanisms
* Landscape-level conservation strategies
* Dedicated Tiger Conservation Plans

#### **b) National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA)**

A statutory body under the Wildlife Protection Act responsible for:

* Approving Tiger Conservation Plans
* Monitoring reserves
* Advising States on tiger habitat management

#### **c) Why Goa Matters Ecologically?**

Goa’s forests form part of the **Western Ghats**, a global biodiversity hotspot.
Its wildlife sanctuaries create a **tiger corridor** with:

* **Kali Tiger Reserve (Karnataka)**
* **Bhimgad Wildlife Sanctuary**
* **Sahyadri Tiger Reserve (Maharashtra)**

This corridor supports both **resident** and **transient** tiger populations and ensures genetic exchange.

---

### **2. The News**

The **Central Empowered Committee (CEC)** of the Supreme Court has recommended that Goa establish a **tiger reserve** in a **phased manner**, following:

* A **Bombay High Court direction (2023)** ordering the State to notify five protected areas as a tiger reserve.
* The Goa Foundation’s petition after **poisoning deaths of a tigress and three cubs** in 2020.
* Prior **NTCA recommendations (2016)** for the same areas.

The Goa government initially opposed the move, claiming **1 lakh people** would be affected—later revised to **5,000–6,000 persons** across **1,274 households**.

The government also argued tigers were merely **transient** in Goa—contradicting its *own earlier submissions* (2018) where it stated Goa hosted a **resident tiger population**.

The Supreme Court asked the CEC to review the matter, undertake field visits, and submit a report—filed last week.

---

### **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

#### **Judicial & Policy Framework**

* **Bombay HC (2023)**: Directed notification of protected areas as a tiger reserve.
* **Supreme Court**: Examining Goa’s SLP; mandated CEC review.
* **NTCA (2016 onwards)**: Ecological assessment supporting tiger reserve status.

#### **Forest Rights Compliance**

* Settlement of **Scheduled Tribes and forest dwellers’ rights** under the Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006.
* Preparation of a **Tiger Conservation Plan** addressing coexistence, voluntary resettlement, and livelihood safeguards.

#### **Conservation Measures**

# How will new codes change labour laws?
## **Implementation of the Four Labour Codes: Status, Features, Concerns & Way Forward**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

#### **a) Labour Codes – What Are They?**

Between 2019–2020, Parliament codified **29 Central labour laws** into **4 Labour Codes**:

1. **Code on Wages (2019)**
2. **Industrial Relations Code (2020)**
3. **Code on Social Security (2020)**
4. **Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions (OSHWC) Code (2020)**

These reforms aim to modernise India’s labour governance, unify fragmented laws, and create a more predictable ecosystem for workers and employers.

#### **b) Why Implementation is Slow**

Labour is a **Concurrent List** subject.
Thus:

* Centre must frame **Central Rules**
* States must frame **State Rules**

A Code cannot be implemented unless **both** sets of Rules are ready.

Though the Centre has issued draft rules for all Codes, several States have not completed the process — delaying nationwide rollout.

#### **c) Importance of Labour Codes**

They aim to:

* Expand social security
* Bring uniformity across states
* Formalise employment
* Reduce litigation and compliance burdens
* Modernise industrial relations

The Codes, however, trigger intense debates on **worker protection vs labour flexibility**.

---

### **2. The News**

On **November 21**, Union Labour Minister Mansukh Mandaviya said the government will now proceed with implementing all four Labour Codes.

But the timeline has stretched because:

* As of **July 2025**:

  * **32 States/UTs** have published draft Rules
  * **West Bengal & Lakshadweep** have not drafted any
  * **Tamil Nadu** has not drafted Rules under Social Security Code
  * **Delhi** has only drafted Rules under the Code on Wages

The Centre told Parliament that **the lag in States** is the main reason for delayed implementation.

The article then elaborates on features, employer responses, trade union concerns, and the next steps.

---

### **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

#### **Structural Reforms**

* Codification of **29 laws** into four simplified Codes.
* Creation of a **national floor wage** for uniform standard of living.
* Digital compliance platforms to reduce paperwork.
* Statutory mandate for **appointment letters** for all workers.

#### **Social Security Expansion**

* Inclusion of **gig workers**, **platform workers**, and **unorganised workers** under social security schemes.
* Mandatory **EPF**, **ESI**, maternity benefits, and insurance coverage for a wider worker base.

#### **Industrial Relations & Ease of Doing Business**

* Facilitating **fixed-term employment**.
* Introducing **negotiating union / negotiating council**.
* Allowing greater flexibility for recruitment and retrenchment (with thresholds increased).

#### **Occupational Safety**

* Single OSH framework for factories, mines, plantations, and migrant workers.
* Mandated welfare facilities and safety inspections.
* Provisions allowing **women to work at night** with safeguards.

1. **Federal Friction**

   * Opposition states object to the Centre’s “unilateral” approach.
   * Fear of erosion of state powers over wage-setting.

2. **Worker Protection Concerns**

   * Trade unions argue the Codes reduce protections:

     * Diluted rights to strike
     * Restrictions on trade union functioning
     * Higher thresholds exclude small factories from coverage
     * Risk of increased contractualisation

3. **Social Security Gaps**

   * 93% of India’s workforce is informal; unions say the Codes do little to change this.
   * No guaranteed mechanism to bring informal workers into social security net.

4. **Employer Expectations vs MSME Realities**

   * Large industries support the Codes for flexibility and uniformity.
   * MSMEs fear increased financial burden and compliance costs.

5. **Implementation Bottlenecks**

   * Uneven state readiness.
   * Need for extensive training of inspectors, employers, HR systems.

6. **Gender & Safety Dimensions**

   * Allowing women into night shifts requires robust enforcement.
   * Unions fear women may face safety risks without systemic preparation.

#### **b) Socio-Economic Impacts**

* Potential for formalisation of workforce
* Growth in industrial employment
* But risk of marginalising unorganised sector workers
* Better productivity through modern compliance systems
* Improved safety and gender equity if implemented well

#### **c) Ethical & Governance Issues**

* Inclusion of gig workers without affecting platform earnings
* Preventing coercive relocations or misuse of fixed-term contracts
* Transparency in wage determination
* Worker participation in rule-making processes

---

### **5. Way Forward**

1. **Strengthen Cooperative Federalism**

# What are the facts on uranium in breast milk?
## **Uranium Found in Breast Milk in Bihar: What the Study Shows and Why Panic Is Unwarranted**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

#### **a) What is Uranium (U238)?**

* A **naturally occurring radioactive metal** found in soil, rocks, groundwater, and even oceans.
* **U238** makes up **99% of natural uranium**.
* Emits **alpha particles** that **cannot penetrate skin**, making external exposure relatively harmless.
* Health concerns arise mainly from **ingestion**, especially long-term exposure through contaminated groundwater.

#### **b) How Does Uranium Enter the Human Body?**

* Primarily through **drinking water** from uranium-rich groundwater.
* Lesser extent through food, soil, or dust.
* After entering the body, most uranium is **excreted via urine**, with only a tiny fraction entering breast milk.

#### **c) Why Breast Milk Was Studied**

* Infants are a **critical vulnerable group**.
* Breast milk can reflect the mother’s exposure to environmental contaminants.
* No global limit exists for uranium in breast milk, but WHO’s limit for drinking water (**30 µg/L**) serves as a comparative yardstick.

---

### **2. The News**

A study titled **“Discovery of uranium content in breast milk and assessment of associated health risks for mothers and infants in Bihar, India”** (published in *Nature*, Nov 21) examined **40 breast milk samples** from lactating mothers across **six districts** of Bihar:

* **Districts sampled:** Begusarai, Katihar, Nalanda, Samastipur, Khagaria, Bhojpur
* **Timeframe:** Oct 2021 – July 2024
* **Testing Centre:** Mahavir Cancer Sansthan & Research Centre, Patna

#### **Key Findings**

* Uranium concentration ranged from **0 to 5.25 µg/L**.
* Highest U238 levels recorded in **Katihar**.
* All values far below WHO’s **30 µg/L** drinking-water guideline.
* Uranium presence strongly correlated with **groundwater contamination**, previously documented in 151 districts across 18 Indian States.

The initial public reaction was panic due to the association of uranium with radioactivity and cancer. However, experts clarified that **levels detected are low and unlikely to cause harm**.

---

### **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

While the news focuses on research findings, broader institutional frameworks exist:

#### **Environmental Monitoring**

* **Central Ground Water Board (CGWB)** conducts periodic water quality surveys, including uranium mapping.
* **Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC)** and **Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB)** monitor radiation compliance.

#### **Health & Safety Regulations**

* **Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS)** sets limits for uranium in drinking water (aligned with WHO guidelines).
* **Health Ministry** guidelines promote breastfeeding and monitor infant health indicators.

#### **Public Health & Water Safety**

* National Rural Drinking Water Programme (now **Jal Jeevan Mission**) tracks groundwater contamination.
* State Pollution Control Boards monitor heavy metal content in water sources.

#### **Research & Surveillance**

* Encouragement of isotope-specific environmental studies under the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE).
* Plans for **expanded studies** across other States to analyse breast milk for uranium traces.

---

### **4. Mains Relevance**

#### **a) Issues & Challenges**

1. **Groundwater Contamination**

   * Uranium levels rising in several districts due to geological factors, excessive groundwater extraction, and declining water tables.

2. **Public Panic Due to Misinterpretation**

   * Leads to harmful behaviours like stopping breastfeeding — risking malnutrition, infections, and higher infant mortality.

3. **Lack of Breast Milk Standards**

   * No globally accepted permissible limit for uranium levels in breast milk, making interpretation harder.

4. **Small Sample Size**

   * Study tested only 40 mothers; not enough for population-wide conclusions.

5. **Environmental Health Surveillance Gaps**

   * Need for regular monitoring of heavy metals in water, soil, and food chains.

#### **b) Impacts on Mothers and Infants**

* Current study indicates **low risk**, but long-term exposure through contaminated water may:

  * Impair kidney development
  * Affect cognitive outcomes
  * Lower IQ and neurodevelopmental milestones

* Mothers themselves are safe:

  * Most uranium is **excreted in urine**, not accumulated in breast milk.

#### **c) Ethical and Governance Concerns**

* Ensuring transparent communication to avoid public panic.
* Need to protect the rights of rural households relying solely on groundwater.
* Scientific accountability in risk communication.

---

### **5. Way Forward**

1. **Strengthen Groundwater Monitoring**

   * Quarterly heavy metal testing in uranium-prone districts.
   * GIS-based mapping of uranium hotspots.

2. **Public Communication Strategy**

   * Clear advisories stating: **breastfeeding is safe**.
   * Avoid sensationalism; focus on science-led messaging.

3. **Safe Drinking Water Provision**

   * Install **reverse osmosis (RO)** or **adsorption-based filtration units** in high-risk areas.
   * Accelerate piped water under **Jal Jeevan Mission**.

4. **Expand Research**

   * Larger sample size across districts and other States.
   * Isotope-specific studies to track uranium movement from environment → mother → infant.

5. **Healthcare Monitoring**

   * Periodic kidney and neurodevelopmental screening for infants in uranium-affected districts.
   * Training ASHA workers and PHCs in environmental health risks.

6. **Environmental Remediation**

   * Promote groundwater recharge.
   * Reduce over-extraction through regulation and incentives.
   * Soil–water interaction studies to understand uranium mobilization.

7. **Inter-Agency Coordination**

   * Collaboration between DAE, ICMR, Jal Shakti Ministry, and State Health Departments.
