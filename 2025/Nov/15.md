# NDA takes Bihar by storm
## **Bihar Assembly Election 2025 – NDA’s Big Victory**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

To understand this news, a few political concepts are useful:

* **Anti-incumbency:** A tendency of voters to vote against the ruling party after long years in power due to dissatisfaction.
* **Vote Share vs Seat Share:**

  * *Vote share* is the percentage of total votes won.
  * *Seat share* is the actual number of seats won.
    In first-past-the-post (FPTP) systems like India’s, high vote share does not necessarily convert into seats if votes are not geographically concentrated.
* **NDA (National Democratic Alliance):** A coalition of parties led by the BJP at national level.
* **Mahagatbandhan/INDIA Bloc:** Opposition alliance composed of RJD, Congress, Left parties, etc.
* **Mahila Rojgar Yojana (MRY):** A state government scheme providing ₹10,000 financial support to women, aimed at livelihood support and election-oriented welfare.

This background frames the electoral outcome in Bihar.

# Flexible inflation targeting, a good balance
## **Review of India’s Flexible Inflation Targeting (FIT) Framework**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

To grasp the significance of this review, it is essential to understand the foundations of India’s monetary policy regime.

#### **A. Flexible Inflation Targeting (FIT) Framework**

* Adopted in **2016** under an amendment to the RBI Act.
* Mandates RBI to maintain **4% inflation with a tolerance band of 2% on either side (2%–6%)**.
* The aim is:

  * **Price stability**,
  * **Macroeconomic stability**,
  * Supporting sustainable long-term growth.

#### **B. Why Inflation Matters**

* High inflation acts as a **regressive tax**, hurting the poor disproportionately.
* It reduces **savings**, distorts **investment decisions**, and impacts **macroeconomic stability**.
* RBI’s emphasis on inflation management strengthened after the end of automatic monetisation (1994), which earlier enabled government overspending by printing money.

#### **C. Headline vs Core Inflation**

* **Headline Inflation:** Includes all items (food + fuel + core items).
* **Core Inflation:** Excludes food and fuel, focusing on demand-driven inflation.
* Debate arises because food prices in India are volatile due to supply shocks, but they also have **second-round effects** on wages and core inflation.

Understanding these distinctions helps in evaluating the adjustments being considered for India’s next inflation-targeting cycle (2026–2031).

---

### **2. The News**

* The current FIT mandate ends in **March 2026** and is presently under review.
* The **RBI released a detailed discussion paper** posing questions on:

  1. Whether **headline** or **core** inflation should be targeted,
  2. The **acceptable level** of inflation for India,
  3. The future **width of the inflation band**.
* The analysis presented in the article responds to these three key questions.

**Key points from the article:**

* Headline inflation should remain the target due to its broader welfare relevance.
* Empirical analysis shows **acceptable inflation is around 4%**, consistent with the existing target.
* The present tolerance band of **±2% (2–6%)** offers sufficient flexibility, but the RBI must avoid staying near the upper limit for long.
* Strong coordination between **FRBM Act (fiscal prudence)** and **FIT (monetary discipline)** is essential for macroeconomic stability.

---

### **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

#### **A. Adoption of the FIT Framework (2016)**

* RBI Act amended to institutionalise inflation targeting.
* Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) established for rate decisions.
* Primary objective: Maintain price stability while supporting growth.

#### **B. Fiscal Controls**

* **FRBM Act, 2003**: Limits fiscal deficit and prevents excessive borrowing.
* Eliminated automatic monetisation of deficits (post-1994), reducing inflationary pressures.

#### **C. Policy Coordination**

* The government and RBI jointly set inflation targets for each 5-year period.
* FIT complements:

  * Fiscal deficit reduction,
  * External sector stability,
  * Sustainable growth frameworks.

#### **D. Efforts to Improve Inflation Measurement**

* Strengthening CPI measurement systems,
* Better monitoring of food supply chains,
* Improved forecasting models for monetary policy decisions.

---

### **4. Mains Relevance**

This topic relates to **GS-III: Economy – Monetary Policy, Inflation, Fiscal-Monetary Coordination**, and partly **GS-II: Governance**.

#### **A. Issues & Challenges**

1. **Headline vs Core Targeting**

   * Food inflation in India has persistent second-round effects → headline targeting is more appropriate.
   * Core inflation alone may misread price pressures in a food-heavy economy.

2. **Threshold Inflation**

   * Growth tends to decline sharply when inflation exceeds **6%**.
   * Empirical estimates indicate an **inflection point at ~4% inflation**, validating the current target.

3. **Band Width**

   * The ±2% band has been flexible enough, but **prolonged 6% inflation undermines credibility**.
   * The challenge lies in anchoring expectations while responding to supply shocks.

4. **Risk of Fiscal Slippage**

   * Relaxation of FRBM norms or high government borrowing can increase inflationary pressures.
   * Past episodes (1970s–1980s) show high inflation caused by **monetisation of fiscal deficits**.

5. **Trade-off Between Growth and Inflation**

   * Phillips Curve relationship weakens in the long run.
   * India’s data indicates that sustained high inflation **hurts growth** rather than supporting it.

6. **Second-Round Effects of Food Inflation**

   * Wage adjustments and cost push factors convert food price spikes into durable inflation.
   * Therefore, monetary policy must consider food inflation.

#### **B. Impacts**

* **Macroeconomic stability:** FIT has helped keep inflation range-bound despite shocks (COVID-19, Ukraine crisis, supply disruptions).
* **Investment climate:** Predictable inflation encourages corporate investment.
* **Welfare:** Anchored inflation protects the poor from severe price volatility.
* **Credibility:** India’s monetary policy credibility has improved globally after adopting FIT.

---

### **5. Way Forward**

1. **Retain Headline Inflation as Target**

   * Reflects the lived experience of households,
   * Captures food inflation and second-round effects.

2. **Maintain the 4% Target**

   * Supported by empirical threshold analysis,
   * Consistent with long-term growth potential,
   * Aligns with historical inflation-growth relationship.

3. **Preserve the ±2% Band**

   * Offers flexibility to deal with supply shocks,
   * But RBI should avoid staying near upper bound for long to maintain credibility.

4. **Strengthen Fiscal-Monetary Coordination**

   * Fiscal prudence under FRBM must work in tandem with monetary tightening.
   * Avoid quasi-monetisation through excessive borrowing.

5. **Improve Inflation Forecasting Models**

   * Incorporating climate shocks, food supply disruptions, and global commodity cycles.
   * Enhance high-frequency data collection on food and fuel prices.

6. **Manage Food Supply Drivers**

   * Invest in storage, logistics, and agricultural reforms to reduce food inflation volatility.
   * Improve MSP procurement, buffer stocks, and market efficiency.

7. **Communicate Expectations Clearly**

   * Strong forward guidance from RBI helps anchor market and household expectations.

8. **Assess Long-Term Structural Changes**

   * Rising incomes and urbanisation may alter consumption patterns and inflation dynamics.
   * Periodic reviews of the basket and weights are essential.
