8. **Strengthen Voter Awareness**

   * Educate citizens about checking and securing their electoral data through campaigns and digital literacy initiatives.

---

### **Conclusion**

India’s electoral roll is the **foundation of its democracy** — as vital as its Constitution or Parliament. Duplicates, fakes, and unauthorized deletions compromise **electoral integrity** and **public trust**.
Reform must combine **technological modernization**, **institutional transparency**, and **multi-stakeholder participation**. The ECI’s credibility depends on whether it can move from **defensive denial** to **proactive accountability** — ensuring that every Indian has **one vote, one identity, and one voice**.

# The malleable Code of Conduct
## Model Code of Conduct (MCC) and Its Relevance Amid Repeated Violations

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Model Code of Conduct (MCC)**:
  A set of **ethical norms and behavioral guidelines** for political parties and candidates to ensure **free, fair, and transparent elections**. It governs the conduct of parties, ministers, and government officials during the election period.

* **Historical Background**:

  * First introduced in **Kerala (1960)** and later adopted nationwide.
  * Officially enforced by the **Election Commission of India (ECI)** since the **1990s**.
  * Last major revision in **2013**, reflecting evolving campaign practices.

* **Duration**:
  The MCC comes into force **from the date of announcement of election schedule** by the ECI and remains in effect **until the results are declared**.

* **Core Provisions**:

  1. **General conduct** – No hate speeches, bribery, or intimidation of voters.
  2. **Meetings and processions** – Prior permission needed; no disturbance of public order.
  3. **Party in power restrictions** – Cannot announce new projects, schemes, financial grants, or use public resources for campaigning.
  4. **Campaigning guidelines** – Regulates use of media, expenditure, and campaign materials.

---

### 2. **The News**

* **What happened**:
  The **Bihar government’s Mukhyamantri Mahila Rojgar Yojana (MMRY)**, launched in **August 2025**, began direct cash transfers of ₹10,000 each to women beneficiaries during the election period.
* **Timeline**:

  * **Aug 2025** – Scheme launched.
  * **Sept 26, 2025** – First tranche disbursed by the Prime Minister.
  * **Oct 31 and Nov 7** – Weekly transfers continued even as **Bihar Assembly elections** were scheduled for **Nov 6 and Nov 11**.
* **Issue**:
  Although technically under an “ongoing scheme,” its **timing and disbursement during the MCC period** violated the **spirit** of the Code by influencing voter sentiment.
* **Broader Context**:
  Successive governments—across parties—have **circumvented MCC** provisions before elections by announcing or executing new projects disguised as extensions of older ones.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Institutional Mechanisms**

**a. Legal Framework**

* The MCC **is not legally enforceable**; it is **a moral and ethical code**, not a statute.
* The **Election Commission of India** enforces it through its constitutional powers under **Article 324** (superintendence, direction, and control of elections).
* Violations may invite action under:

  * **Indian Penal Code (IPC)** – Sections on bribery, defamation, and undue influence.
  * **Representation of the People Act, 1951 (RPA)** – Provisions related to corrupt practices (Sections 123–136).

**b. Parliamentary Recommendations**

* The **Standing Committee on Personnel, Public Grievances, Law and Justice (2013)** recommended **making MCC legally binding**.
* The **ECI opposed** this, citing short election cycles (≈45 days) and slow judicial processes, which could delay polls.

**c. Policy Alternatives Discussed**

* **Simultaneous Elections**: Proposed partly to reduce the MCC’s repetitive enforcement, which disrupts governance and project implementation.
* **Digital Monitoring**: ECI increasingly uses **social media surveillance**, **real-time expenditure tracking**, and **cVIGIL app** for complaint reporting.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

**a. Issues and Challenges**

* **Non-enforceability**: Since MCC is not a law, violations often go unpunished or receive symbolic warnings.
* **Ethical vs. Legal Divide**: Many actions may not technically break laws but still **violate the spirit of neutrality**.
* **Governance Disruption**: Frequent elections and MCC restrictions delay welfare schemes and policy rollouts.
* **Cash and Populist Politics**: Direct cash transfers (like MMRY) before elections blur the line between governance and electoral influence.
* **Erosion of Public Trust**: Perceived bias or inaction by the ECI in high-profile violations undermines faith in electoral institutions.

**b. Impacts**

* **Political**: Distorts the level playing field by enabling ruling parties to leverage state machinery.
* **Economic**: Unplanned expenditure on pre-poll schemes burdens public finances.
* **Social**: Creates voter dependency and expectation of last-minute freebies.
* **Institutional**: Weakens ECI’s moral authority if its directives are routinely ignored.

**c. Constitutional & Ethical Dimensions**

* **Article 324** – Entrusts ECI with ensuring *free and fair elections*; any lapse affects the **basic structure of democracy**.
* **Ambedkar’s warning** – Even good laws fail if implemented by “a bad lot” — applicable here, where intent, not law, determines efficacy.
* **Ethics in Governance (GS Paper IV)** – Reflects the tension between **political morality** and **legalistic loopholes**.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Legal Backing for Key MCC Provisions**

   * Codify select MCC rules (especially those on **use of government funds and announcements**) into the **Representation of the People Act**.

2. **Empower the Election Commission**

   * Strengthen its authority to impose penalties, including **temporary disqualification** or **funding suspension** for repeat violators.

3. **Real-time Public Disclosure**

   * Mandate that all government disbursements during MCC period be published online for **public audit**.

4. **Define “Ongoing Schemes” Clearly**

   * Create a fixed timeline — e.g., only schemes **operational six months before election announcement** qualify as ongoing.

5. **Strengthen Voter Awareness and Ethics**

   * Public campaigns to sensitise voters that **freebies during elections** often undermine democratic fairness.

6. **Institutional Accountability**

   * Encourage **post-election reviews** by independent experts or parliamentary committees to assess MCC compliance.

7. **Reform MCC Through Consensus**

   * ECI must engage **all political parties** to evolve a **revised, enforceable MCC 2.0**, reflecting today’s political and technological realities.

---

### **Conclusion**

The **Model Code of Conduct** remains a cornerstone of India’s electoral integrity — but its **moral authority is waning** due to habitual violations cloaked in legality.
Ambedkar’s observation aptly reminds us that **laws alone cannot safeguard democracy**; the **ethics and intent of those in power** determine their value.
To preserve electoral sanctity, India must move toward **a more enforceable, transparent, and ethically grounded MCC**, ensuring that governance and elections never overlap in motive or manipulation.

# FATF releases updated asset recovery framework; India played a key role, says ED
## FATF Releases Global “Asset Recovery Guidance and Best Practices”

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Financial Action Task Force (FATF)**:
  An **inter-governmental body** established in **1989** by the G7 to combat **money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation financing**. It sets **international standards** and monitors member countries’ compliance.

  * India became a **member in 2010**.
  * FATF works through **40 Recommendations**, which form the global anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CFT) framework.

* **Asset Recovery**:
  Refers to the **process of tracing, freezing, confiscating, and returning** the proceeds of crime — whether derived from corruption, money laundering, terrorism, or fraud.
  It is a **key pillar of global financial integrity** and ensures that “crime does not pay.”

* **Non-conviction-based (NCB) confiscation**:
  A legal mechanism that allows authorities to **seize criminal assets even without a criminal conviction** — for example, when the accused has absconded, died, or prosecution is otherwise impractical.

---

### 2. **The News**

* **What happened**:
  The **FATF released its “Asset Recovery Guidance and Best Practices”** document — a landmark update to global standards for confiscation and cooperation in fighting financial crimes.
* **When**:
  Announced in **November 2025**.
* **Who was involved**:

  * The **Financial Action Task Force (FATF)** led the global framework.
  * **India’s Enforcement Directorate (ED)** played a **prominent role** in drafting and contributing case studies.
* **Highlights of the Guidance**:

  1. Provides a **comprehensive framework** for identifying, tracing, freezing, managing, confiscating, and returning criminal assets.
  2. Represents the **most significant FATF reform in over 30 years** on confiscation and international cooperation.
  3. Expands the definition of “asset recovery” to cover the **entire process** — from detection to repatriation.
  4. **Introduces Non-Conviction-Based Confiscation (NCB)** — allows asset seizure even without conviction when prosecution isn’t feasible.
  5. Promotes **extended confiscations** and **unexplained wealth orders (UWOs)**, compelling individuals to prove the lawful source of their wealth.
  6. Encourages **early-stage provisional measures** to freeze or secure assets to prevent dissipation.
* **India’s Role**:

  * India, through the **Enforcement Directorate (ED)**, contributed **case examples** that have been included in the guidance as **model practices**.
  * This recognition signals India’s **growing international influence in asset recovery and anti-money laundering enforcement**.

# Challenges facing the upcoming income survey
## India’s First Household Income Survey (2026): A New Milestone in Socio-Economic Data Collection

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **What is the Household Income Survey (HIS)?**
  The **Household Income Survey (2026)** is an upcoming large-scale national survey designed to **directly measure household incomes** — marking a **first-of-its-kind** initiative in India’s statistical system.

  * Unlike earlier surveys that *inferred* income through expenditure or employment data, this survey will **collect income data explicitly**, along with detailed socio-economic variables.

* **Why is it needed?**
  India currently relies on **proxy measures** like:

  1. **Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS)** – captures wages and employment trends, not household-level income.
  2. **Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES)** – uses consumption as an indirect measure of income.
  3. **RBI’s Consumer Confidence Survey (CCS)** – tracks public perception of income changes, not actual data.
     Together, these offer **partial insights**, but no comprehensive understanding of income distribution, inequality, or financial well-being.

* **Institutional Context**:
  The survey is being conducted by the **Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI)**, aligning with efforts to modernize India’s official data architecture and support evidence-based policymaking.

---

### 2. **The News**

* **What**:
  The **Household Income Survey, 2026** will be India’s **first direct, nationwide attempt** to measure **income across all sources** and link it with detailed household characteristics.

* **When**:
  To be launched in **2026**, after **pilot testing in August 2025**.

* **Key Features of the Survey**:

  1. **Comprehensive Income Capture**

     * Salaried workers: salary, allowances, bonuses, stock options, overtime, leave encashment, severance pay.
     * Casual workers: number of days worked, wages, tips, bonuses.
     * Self-employed: crop sales, gross receipts, raw material and input costs.
  2. **Socio-economic and Demographic Detailing**

     * Data on caste, religion, occupation, land ownership, property type, dwelling size, and household loans.
  3. **Integration with Expenditure Data**

     * Repeats parts of HCES to record input costs, rent, and maintenance expenses — enabling **profit estimation** for households.
  4. **Inclusion of Welfare Transfers**

     * Records income from **Central and State schemes** (e.g., *Kalaignar Magalir Urimai Thittam* in Tamil Nadu).
     * Also tracks **pensions, alimony, remittances**, and **social transfers**.
  5. **Income–Debt Linkages**

     * Measures what share of household income goes toward **loan repayments**, offering insights into EMI-dependent urban lifestyles.
  6. **Agricultural Insights**

     * Enables direct assessment of claims like “**Doubling Farmers’ Income**” through self-reported agricultural income and costs.

* **Pilot Testing Findings (August 2025)**:

  * **95% respondents** found income questions **sensitive** or intrusive.
  * **Affluent households** hesitated more than rural respondents.
  * **Many overstated expenses** or underreported income, indicating **recall bias** and **response hesitation**.
  * **Proposed solutions**:

    * Deploy local-language field staff for trust-building.
    * Introduce **self-compilation options** for urban gated communities.
    * Use media outreach to explain the survey’s purpose and confidentiality assurances.

* **National Statistical Commission (NSC)** – ensures quality, independence, and credibility of national statistics.
* **Economic Census & Socio-Economic Caste Census (SECC)** – capture household-level economic data but lack direct income measures.
* **Digital India Initiatives** – enable better integration of administrative datasets (PAN, GST, UPI) for validation of survey estimates.

**b. Global Context**

* **OECD and World Bank** conduct similar income surveys for understanding poverty and inequality (e.g., *EU-SILC*, *LIS Database*).
* India’s HIS aims to **align with international standards** in household income measurement, enhancing **comparability and global data credibility**.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

**a. Issues and Challenges**

* **Sensitivity of income data**: People consider income questions intrusive; may hide or inflate figures.
* **Accuracy and recall errors**: Difficulty in remembering exact income or interest earned.
* **Trust deficit**: Fear that data may be shared with tax authorities.
* **Heterogeneity**: Variability across regions, occupations, and informal sectors complicates aggregation.
* **Underreporting in informal economy**: A large share of Indian income remains unaccounted for due to informal employment.
* **Administrative capacity**: Requires extensive field training, multilingual staff, and technological tools for real-time validation.

**b. Implications and Importance**

* **Policy Impact**:

  * Enables **better targeting of welfare schemes** and subsidy rationalisation.
  * Provides factual basis for debates on **inequality, social justice, and income mobility**.

# What constitutes as contempt of court in India?
## Contempt of Court and the Protection of Judicial Authority in India

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Concept of Contempt of Court:**
  “Contempt of court” refers to acts that **undermine the authority, dignity, or functioning of the judiciary**. It ensures respect for judicial institutions and protects the integrity of justice delivery.

* **Constitutional Basis:**

  * **Article 19(2)** – Allows reasonable restrictions on free speech, including for “contempt of court”.
  * **Article 129** – Declares the **Supreme Court** as a *Court of Record* with power to punish for its contempt.
  * **Article 215** – Confers the same status and power on **High Courts**.

* **Statutory Basis:**

  * **Contempt of Courts Act, 1971** codifies the procedure and classification of contempt.

    * **Civil Contempt (Sec. 2(b))**: Wilful disobedience of a court order or undertaking.
    * **Criminal Contempt (Sec. 2(c))**:

      1. Scandalising or lowering the authority of any court.
      2. Prejudicing or interfering with judicial proceedings.
      3. Interfering with the administration of justice in any other manner.

* **Initiation of Contempt Proceedings:**

  * Courts can initiate **suo motu** action.
  * A third party can move a petition **with consent of the Attorney General (AG)** or **Advocate General (Adv. G)** for Supreme Court and High Courts respectively.

---

### 2. **The News**

* **Trigger:**
  Recent **derogatory and contemptuous remarks** allegedly made against the **Chief Justice of India (CJI)** and the **Supreme Court** have sparked debate on the **limits of free expression and judicial criticism**.

* **Core Issue:**
  The remarks, widely circulated on social media, are seen as acts that **diminish the authority** of the judiciary and **interfere with the administration of justice**, prompting calls for contempt proceedings.

* **Judicial Context:**
  The controversy has reignited discussions on whether **criticism of judges or judgments** should invite contempt or be protected as **fair criticism** within democratic discourse.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Institutional Framework**

**a. Legislative and Constitutional Provisions:**

* **Contempt of Courts Act, 1971** – Governs all contempt proceedings.
* **Article 19(1)(a)** – Guarantees freedom of speech, but subject to contempt restrictions under **Article 19(2)**.
* **Articles 129 & 215** – Empower the Supreme Court and High Courts respectively to act against contempt.

**b. Judicial Precedents:**

1. **Ashwini Kumar Ghosh v. Arabinda Bose (1952)** –
   Fair criticism of judicial acts is allowed, but transgression becomes contempt.

2. **E.M.S. Namboodiripad v. T.N. Nambiar (1970)** –
   Public statements attacking judges’ integrity amount to contempt, as they lower public confidence in justice.

3. **Anil Ratan Sarkar v. Hirak Ghosh (2002)** –
   The power of contempt must be exercised cautiously and only when a clear violation exists.

4. **M.V. Jayarajan v. High Court of Kerala (2015)** –
   Abusive public speeches against judicial orders amount to criminal contempt for undermining judicial authority.

5. **Shanmugam @ Lakshminarayanan v. High Court of Madras (2025)** –
   The object of contempt punishment is **to preserve the administration of justice**, not to shield judges from criticism.

**c. Institutional Safeguards:**

* The **Attorney General’s consent** serves as a gatekeeping mechanism against misuse of contempt proceedings.
* Courts can choose to **forgive or warn** if the contemnor issues an **unqualified apology** (Section 12, Contempt of Courts Act).

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

**a. Issues and Challenges**

* **Balance between Free Speech and Judicial Dignity:**
  Contempt law safeguards judicial independence but risks **curbing legitimate criticism**.
* **Broad Interpretation of ‘Scandalising the Court’:**
  The phrase is subjective and can be misused to stifle dissent.
* **Media and Social Media Trials:**
  Amplify contemptuous statements, influencing public perception and subverting judicial neutrality.
* **Judicial Accountability vs. Judicial Immunity:**
  Excessive use of contempt powers can make the judiciary appear intolerant of criticism.
* **Global Concerns:**
  Many democracies (e.g., UK) have **abolished “scandalising the court”** as an offence, favouring transparency and criticism within limits.

**b. Impacts**

* **Institutional Impact:** Upholds judicial independence but risks alienating public opinion if perceived as censorship.
* **Democratic Impact:** The judiciary must retain legitimacy through reasoned judgments, not fear of punishment.
* **Ethical Impact:**
  Contempt should not be a tool of ego but a safeguard for justice — reflecting the judiciary’s moral, not coercive, authority.

**c. Constitutional and Ethical Perspective:**

* **Article 19(2)** enables reasonable restriction for maintaining judicial dignity — balancing **rights and responsibility**.
* **Constitutional Morality (Dr. B.R. Ambedkar)**:
  Respect for institutions forms the backbone of democracy; contemptuous acts erode this moral foundation.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Redefine “Scandalising the Court”**

   * Narrow its scope to cover only acts that **substantially interfere with justice**, not mere critical opinion.

2. **Promote Transparency and Self-Restraint**

   * Judiciary should respond to criticism with **reasoned explanations**, not contempt proceedings, unless absolutely necessary.

3. **Public Awareness and Media Guidelines**

   * Strengthen media ethics to ensure judicial criticism remains informed, factual, and responsible.

4. **Judicial Training in Communication Ethics**

   * Encourage sensitivity among judges to handle criticism without compromising institutional dignity.

5. **Periodic Review of Contempt Law**

   * Establish a parliamentary or Law Commission review to align the 1971 Act with **modern democratic values**.

6. **Encourage Constructive Criticism**

   * Facilitate public dialogue and academic scrutiny of judgments as part of judicial accountability mechanisms.

7. **Preserve Judicial Independence**

   * While criticism is essential, personal attacks or misinformation campaigns must be checked to preserve **faith in the justice system**.

---

### **Conclusion**

The **Contempt of Court law** is both a **shield and a sword** — meant to protect judicial integrity, not silence democratic voices.
As Dr. Ambedkar warned, even good laws falter under bad intent. Hence, the true test of constitutional morality lies not in punitive action, but in balancing **judicial dignity with democratic freedom**.

The judiciary, media, and citizens must together uphold **constructive criticism, institutional respect, and legal responsibility** — ensuring that justice is not only done but **remains credible in the eyes of the people**.
