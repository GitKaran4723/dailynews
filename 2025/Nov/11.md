# What South Asia wants from COP30
### 1. **Basic Understanding**

**Background — The Paris Agreement (2015):**

* Adopted at **COP21**, the Paris Agreement is a landmark global accord under the **UNFCCC**, committing countries to limit global temperature rise to **well below 2°C**, ideally **1.5°C**, above pre-industrial levels.
* It relies on **Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)** — self-declared emission and adaptation commitments by each country, to be strengthened every five years.

**Climate Change & South Asia:**

* South Asia, home to **nearly two billion people**, is one of the most **climate-vulnerable regions** in the world.
* The region faces frequent **heatwaves**, **floods**, **landslides**, **glacial lake outbursts**, **rising sea levels**, and **crop losses**.
* Countries like **India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Maldives, and Sri Lanka** share interconnected ecosystems — the Himalayas, monsoon systems, and the Indian Ocean — making **regional cooperation essential**.

**Context of COP30 (Belém, Brazil):**

* A decade after the Paris Agreement, COP30 focuses on **implementation, finance, and adaptation**.
* It comes amid **weakening multilateralism**, **rising trade protectionism**, and the **U.S.’s withdrawal** from the Paris Agreement once again — undermining trust in global climate governance.

---

### 2. **The News**

* **South Asian nations** have come together to articulate a **shared regional climate agenda** at **COP30 in Brazil**, led by the **Special Envoy for South Asia**.
* The region’s approach is **pragmatic and collaborative**, focusing on:

  * Renewable energy transitions,
  * Climate-resilient agriculture, and
  * Integrating adaptation into national development plans.
* Through consultations with governments and civil society in **Bhutan, Nepal, Maldives, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh**, five **core concerns and priorities** were identified:

**1️⃣ Implementation Gap:**

* There is a **major shortfall between pledges and delivery** — only **65 countries** have submitted enhanced NDCs.
* According to **CEEW**, of 203 global initiatives launched since 2015, only **5% achieved their stated goals**.
* South Asia must therefore **strengthen regional cooperation**, align priorities, and establish robust governance to track implementation.

**2️⃣ Adaptation Priority:**

* The **ADB** projects that South Asia may see **double the number of days above 35°C** by 2100.
* Impacts range from **glacial floods (Nepal)** to **coastal submergence (Maldives)** and **heatwaves (India)**.
* Emphasis is on **locally-led adaptation**, supported by **adequate technical, institutional, and financial assistance**.

**3️⃣ Trust Deficit:**

* Repeated **broken promises** and **non-fulfilment of climate finance commitments** by developed nations have eroded trust.
* Developed nations must **honour their pledges**, enhance NDC ambition, and **rebuild faith in multilateralism**.

**4️⃣ Climate Finance:**

* Climate finance must be:

  * **Predictable** (long-term and stable),
  * **Adequate** (matching actual needs),
  * **Accessible** (low transaction costs), and
  * **Non-debt inducing** (grants over loans).
* South Asia calls for a **tripling of adaptation finance** and **dedicated regional allocations** from funds like the **Green Climate Fund (GCF)** and the **Loss and Damage Fund**.
* Proposal: Establish a **South Asian Resilience Finance Facility (SARFF)** to channel innovative regional funding.

**5️⃣ Role of Non-State Actors:**

* **Private sector, civil society, academia, youth**, and **subnational governments** must complement state efforts.
* Businesses can drive sustainable innovation; civil society can ensure accountability; youth can infuse urgency and innovation.
* Emphasizes **regional knowledge exchange** and **traditional wisdom sharing** across borders.

# In free fall
## Sudan’s Darfur Crisis: RSF Atrocities and the Deepening Civil War

---

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

**Sudan — A Brief Background:**

* Located in **North-East Africa**, Sudan has been marred by **ethnic conflicts**, **military coups**, and **humanitarian crises** for decades.
* The **Darfur conflict** began in **2003**, when ethnic African rebel groups accused the **Arab-dominated government** of marginalising them.
* In response, the government mobilised the **Janjaweed militia**, notorious for committing genocide-like atrocities against non-Arab communities.

**The Rapid Support Forces (RSF):**

* The **RSF** was formally created in **2013** by then-President **Omar al-Bashir**, evolving from the **Janjaweed** militia.
* Ostensibly a paramilitary force under the government, it became **Bashir’s personal army**, used for internal suppression.
* The RSF later gained significant autonomy, wealth (from gold mines in Darfur), and external support — notably from the **UAE**.

**Current Conflict (Since 2023):**

* A full-scale **civil war erupted in April 2023** between the **Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF)**, led by **Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan**, and the **RSF**, led by **Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (Hemedti)**.
* Both factions were partners in the **2021 military coup** that derailed Sudan’s democratic transition, but they split over the issue of **integrating RSF into the army**.
* The war has devastated Sudan, leading to **mass displacement**, **food insecurity**, and **state fragmentation**.

---

### 2. **The News**

* In **late October 2025**, the **RSF captured El-Fasher**, the last major army-held city in **Darfur**, marking a critical military and humanitarian turning point.
* Following the city’s capture, the **RSF carried out mass atrocities** — killings, rapes, and the **massacre of civilians** at a **maternity hospital**.
* The **Darfur region**, already famine-stricken, is now **largely under RSF control**, with the militia holding **five of Darfur’s provincial capitals**.
* The **UN** has termed Sudan’s humanitarian crisis as the **worst in the world**, with:

  * **12 million displaced persons**,
  * **Tens of thousands killed**, and
  * Widespread **famine** and **disease outbreaks**.
* Both the **RSF** and the **Sudanese army** have been accused of **war crimes**, but the RSF’s actions are increasingly being described as **genocidal**.
* The **SAF** continues to control central and northern Sudan (backed by **Egypt**), while the **RSF** dominates Darfur (backed by the **UAE**).

---

### 3. **Government and International Interventions**

**Domestic Developments:**

* The **Omar al-Bashir regime (1989–2019)** used militias like the Janjaweed/RSF for ethnic cleansing and suppression.
* The **2019 revolution** toppled Bashir, raising hopes for democracy, but the **2021 coup** by the SAF and RSF ended the civilian-led transition.
* Post-2021, Sudan has been under **military rule**, with failed attempts at international mediation.

**International Response:**

* The **United Nations**, **African Union (AU)**, and **IGAD (Intergovernmental Authority on Development)** have repeatedly called for **ceasefires** and **peace talks**, with limited success.
* **U.S. and European Union** have imposed **sanctions** on both RSF and army leaders.
* **UAE and Egypt**, however, have continued **indirectly arming their respective proxies**, aggravating the conflict.
* Humanitarian organisations like **WFP** and **UNHCR** face immense challenges in delivering aid amid violence.

**International Legal Actions:**

* The **International Criminal Court (ICC)** still has open **warrants for Omar al-Bashir** for genocide in Darfur (2008).
* The RSF’s current crimes could also **trigger ICC prosecution** under **crimes against humanity** or **genocide statutes**.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### **Issues and Challenges**

1. **Ethnic and Sectarian Cleavages:** Arab vs. African communities underpin the violence, deepening social fractures.
2. **State Fragmentation:** Dual power structures (Army vs RSF) risk **state collapse** and **regional spillover** into Chad, South Sudan, and Libya.
3. **Humanitarian Catastrophe:** Famine, mass displacement, and gender-based violence have reached unprecedented scales.
4. **Proxy Involvement:** Regional powers (Egypt, UAE) prolong the war for strategic gains, undermining peace prospects.
5. **Erosion of Multilateralism:** The global community’s fragmented response weakens the credibility of international humanitarian law.

#### **Impacts and Significance**

* **For Africa:** The conflict threatens regional stability in the **Sahel and Horn of Africa**, complicating existing crises in Chad and Ethiopia.
* **For Global Governance:** Highlights the **limitations of UN peacekeeping** and the **failure of post-conflict state-building** efforts.
* **For India:** As part of **UN peacekeeping missions in Sudan and South Sudan**, India’s engagement underscores its role in global peace operations and humanitarian diplomacy.

#### **Ethical and Human Rights Dimensions**

* **Genocide and ethnic cleansing** violate the **Responsibility to Protect (R2P)** doctrine adopted by the UN in 2005.
* The atrocities challenge the world’s moral conscience and question the **efficacy of global justice mechanisms** like the ICC.
* Raises the issue of **accountability vs. realpolitik**, as foreign powers continue to arm perpetrators.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

**1️⃣ Immediate Ceasefire and Dialogue:**

* Global and regional actors (AU, UN, IGAD) must **press Egypt and UAE** to halt arms supplies and **enforce a ceasefire**.
* Appoint **neutral mediators** to broker dialogue between the **SAF and RSF**, with participation from **civilian representatives**.

**2️⃣ Humanitarian Corridors and Aid Delivery:**

* Create **UN-supervised humanitarian corridors** for safe passage of aid to Darfur and Khartoum.
* Strengthen coordination between **WFP**, **UNHCR**, and **local NGOs**.

**3️⃣ Accountability Mechanisms:**

* Establish an **international fact-finding mission** under the UN Human Rights Council.
* Pursue **ICC prosecutions** against RSF commanders for crimes against humanity and gender-based violence.

**4️⃣ Long-term Political Settlement:**

* Initiate a **Sudan Peace Process 2.0**, emphasizing:

  * Federal governance,
  * Civilian oversight of security forces, and
  * Integration of militias under a unified command structure.

**5️⃣ Global Responsibility:**

* Revive the **Responsibility to Protect (R2P)** principle for Darfur-like crises.
* The **UN Security Council** must move beyond veto paralysis to authorise **targeted sanctions** and **humanitarian interventions**.

---

### ✅ **Summary Insight (For Mains Answer Writing)**

> *“Sudan’s tragedy is a cautionary tale of how militarised politics, ethnic polarisation, and external interference can destroy a fragile state. The atrocities in Darfur are not just an African crisis but a test of global conscience — one that demands credible action, not silence.”*

---

### 5. **Mains Relevance**

#### **Issues and Challenges:**

1. **Fiscal Impact:**

   * The **pension bill (₹2.76 lakh crore)** forms a large component of the **2025–26 Union Budget’s revenue expenditure**.
   * Salary and pension hikes significantly affect **fiscal deficit targets** and **States’ finances**.
2. **Private–Public Pay Parity:**

   * Entry-level government jobs often pay **higher than private sector**, but **senior roles** offer lower compensation, discouraging experts.
3. **Attracting Talent:**

   * Lack of performance-based incentives limits recruitment of **domain specialists** in technology, economics, and policy design.
4. **Intangibles & Work Conditions:**

   * TORs do not include parameters like **training, workplace flexibility**, or **learning environment**, which affect productivity.
5. **Pension Sustainability:**

   * The shift from **Old Pension Scheme (OPS)** to **National Pension System (NPS)** remains politically contentious.

#### **Impact and Significance:**

* **Economic:** Increases aggregate demand but pressures fiscal resources.
* **Administrative:** Enhances morale and motivation among government employees.
* **Political:** Implementation of CPC recommendations often becomes an electoral issue.
* **Federal:** State governments face **spillover fiscal stress** as they adopt Central recommendations.

---

### 6. **Way Forward**

**1️⃣ Broaden the Composition of the CPC:**

* Include **finance experts, HR professionals, and labour economists** to bring multi-dimensional insights into pay reform.

**2️⃣ Introduce Performance-linked Pay:**

* Align increments and promotions with **measurable outcomes**, particularly for managerial and specialist roles.

**3️⃣ Rationalise Pension Liabilities:**

* Gradually phase out non-contributory pensions and expand **NPS with guaranteed minimum returns**.

**4️⃣ Focus on Non-Monetary Benefits:**

* Include **learning, work-life balance, mental health, and flexible work arrangements** in service design.

**5️⃣ Encourage Differentiation in Pay Structure:**

* Offer **market-linked salaries** for niche expertise (e.g., AI, cybersecurity, data analytics) while maintaining equity for general services.

**6️⃣ Fiscal Prudence and Phased Implementation:**

* Stagger salary hikes over multiple years to minimise fiscal shock and maintain macroeconomic stability.

---

### ✅ **Summary Insight (For Mains Answer Writing)**

> *“The 8th Central Pay Commission represents a critical balancing act — between fiscal prudence and fair compensation, between tradition and reform. To sustain morale, attract talent, and ensure fiscal discipline, India must modernise its public pay architecture from one that rewards tenure to one that values performance, equity, and skill.”*

# Why access to knowledge is crucial for innovation
## 2025 Nobel Prize in Economics: Knowledge, Innovation, and Social Barriers to Growth

---

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

**The Nobel Prize in Economics (2025):**

* Awarded to **Joel Mokyr**, **Philippe Aghion**, and **Peter Howitt** for their pioneering research on **technological change, innovation, and economic growth**.
* While Aghion and Howitt are best known for their **Schumpeterian theory of “creative destruction”**, Joel Mokyr adds a **historical and cultural dimension**, focusing on **how societies generate, share, and apply knowledge**.

**Schumpeter’s Core Idea — Creative Destruction:**

* Economic growth is driven by **entrepreneurial innovation** that replaces old technologies and systems (“creative destruction”).
* However, **Mokyr extends this concept** by arguing that innovation itself depends on **the social and cultural institutions that determine the flow and accessibility of knowledge**.

---

### 2. **Mokyr’s Model: Knowledge as the Engine of Growth**

**Two Types of Knowledge:**

| Type                        | Description                                                            | Example                                      |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Propositional Knowledge** | Theoretical or scientific knowledge — understanding *why* things work. | Physics, chemistry, economic theories.       |
| **Prescriptive Knowledge**  | Practical or technical knowledge — knowing *how* to make things work.  | Engineering, craftsmanship, software coding. |

**Core Argument:**

* Economic growth occurs **when both forms of knowledge expand** *and* are **shared widely across society**.
* Merely *possessing* knowledge is insufficient — **access, exchange, and application** of knowledge drive true innovation.
* Hence, technological progress is not purely economic; it is **a social and cultural process** shaped by institutions, norms, and values.

**Key Insight:**

> *A society grows not by hoarding knowledge, but by democratizing it.*

**Implications of Mokyr’s Model:**

1. Free exchange of ideas fosters invention and entrepreneurship.
2. Closed hierarchies and restrictive institutions (e.g., caste, patriarchy, or elite monopolies) hinder knowledge diffusion.
3. Economic dynamism depends as much on **education and social inclusion** as on capital and markets.

---

### 3. **Application to India: Caste, Knowledge and Growth**

**The Caste System as a Knowledge Barrier:**

* Historically, **caste** determined access to **education, professions, and skills**, restricting both *propositional* (scientific) and *prescriptive* (technical) knowledge to a few.
* Violence and exclusion reinforced this divide, preventing **cross-community learning** — essential for innovation.
* Even post-Independence, while **reservations** sought to democratize access, **elite capture of quality education** persists due to:

  * Unequal school infrastructure.
  * Expensive private universities.
  * Declining public investment in education.

**Economic Implications:**

* **Knowledge asymmetry** leads to **low innovation density** — fewer individuals experiment or create.
* **Fragmented labour markets** mirror social divisions, reducing productivity and cooperation.
* **Social rigidity** suppresses the free flow of ideas — contradicting Mokyr’s core principle that *innovation is a social act of exchange*.

**Policy Relevance:**

* Expanding access to **quality public education** and **breaking caste barriers** are not just welfare measures — they are **growth strategies**.
* As Mokyr’s model implies, **social reform is economic reform** when knowledge is the productive asset.

---

### 4. **Automation and the New Knowledge Divide**

**Automation & Job Polarisation:**

* **AI and automation** are transforming labour markets by:

  * Eliminating **routine jobs**.
  * Expanding **high-skill jobs** (AI developers, data scientists).
  * Increasing **low-skill service jobs** (delivery, hospitality).
* This creates a **hollowed-out middle**, where fewer people gain **hands-on experience with production technologies**.

**Implications for Knowledge Sharing:**

* **Prescriptive knowledge** — the “how-to” of production — risks becoming concentrated in a small elite of engineers and machine operators.
* Workers displaced by automation **lose opportunities to learn by doing**, weakening the **social transmission of technical skills**.
* Over time, this reduces the **breadth of practical knowledge** in society, undermining innovation — even if productivity rises temporarily.

**Analytical Link (Mokyr’s Perspective):**

> * Caste and unequal education restrict access to *propositional knowledge.*
> * Automation and polarisation restrict access to *prescriptive knowledge.*
> * Together, they create a **two-tiered economy**: a small class of innovators and a large class excluded from innovation.

---

### 5. **Mains Relevance: Critical Analysis**

#### **Issues and Challenges**

1. **Knowledge Inequality:** Concentration of education and technology in elite groups.
2. **Institutional Barriers:** Social hierarchies (caste, gender, region) restrict innovation.
3. **Automation Risk:** Technological progress may deepen inequality if not accompanied by upskilling.
4. **Retreat of the Public Sector:** Privatisation of higher education limits access for disadvantaged communities.

#### **Broader Impacts**

* **Social:** Restricts social mobility and perpetuates inequality.
* **Economic:** Reduces aggregate innovation capacity and long-term growth potential.
* **Cultural:** Weakens collaborative learning traditions essential for creativity.
* **Ethical:** Challenges the principle of *equal opportunity to participate in progress*.

#### **India-specific Lessons from Mokyr’s Framework:**

* **Education reform** must be treated as an engine of economic growth, not just welfare.
* **Cultural reform** (reducing social exclusion) complements economic liberalisation.
* **Innovation policy** should integrate *inclusive access to knowledge* with *technological upgrading.*

---

### 6. **Way Forward**

**1️⃣ Democratise Knowledge:**

* Strengthen **public education systems** — from primary to university level — with emphasis on affordability and quality.
* Mandate **inclusivity in private universities** through reservation or financial aid mechanisms.

**2️⃣ Promote Cross-Social Collaboration:**

* Encourage **interdisciplinary and inter-community innovation hubs**.
* Break down **socio-occupational silos** to enable wider idea exchange.

**3️⃣ Balance Automation with Upskilling:**

* Invest in **technical and vocational training** to ensure workers adapt to new technologies.
* Foster **“learn-by-doing”** programs and industrial apprenticeships.

**4️⃣ Integrate Cultural and Economic Policy:**

* Treat **social inclusion**, **gender equality**, and **anti-caste reforms** as economic accelerators, not separate moral goals.

**5️⃣ Knowledge as Public Good:**

* Open access to publicly funded research and technological data.
* Encourage **knowledge commons** through open innovation and digital learning platforms.

---

### ✅ **Summary Insight (For Mains Answer Writing)**

> *“Joel Mokyr’s model redefines growth as a cultural process — where innovation depends on the diffusion of both ideas and skills. In India, breaking caste barriers, expanding access to quality education, and mitigating automation’s exclusionary effects are not only moral imperatives but essential economic strategies for inclusive and sustained growth.”*
