# CJI to consider plea to revive NJAC, end Collegium system
## **Revival of NJAC vs Collegium System**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

#### **Collegium System**

* The current mechanism for appointing judges to the Supreme Court and High Courts.
* Composed of the Chief Justice of India (CJI) + 4 senior-most SC judges (for SC appointments) and CJI + 2 senior-most SC judges (for HC appointments).
* Evolved through *Judges Cases* (1981, 1993, 1998) and is **judge-made law**, not established by the Constitution.

#### **National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC)**

* Created by the **99th Constitutional Amendment (2014)**.
* Aimed to replace the Collegium system.
* Composition:

  * CJI (Chairperson)
  * 2 senior-most SC judges
  * Union Law Minister
  * 2 eminent persons
* Intended to introduce:

  * Executive participation
  * Transparency
  * Institutional checks and balances

#### **2015 Judgment**

* In *Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association (SCAORA) vs Union of India*, a 5-judge Bench struck down the NJAC as **unconstitutional**, primarily because:

  * It diluted judicial primacy in appointments (violated judicial independence under basic structure doctrine).
  * Potential risk of political/executive influence.

---

### **2. The News**

* On Wednesday, CJI **Surya Kant** orally stated that the Supreme Court would **consider a plea** demanding revival of the **NJAC** and ending the current **Collegium system**.
* The plea, filed by **Advocate Mathews J. Nedumpara**, seeks:

  * Reconsideration of the 2015 decision striking down the NJAC.
  * Restoration of a system where the executive has equal say in judicial appointments.
* Nedumpara has asked for **in-person argument permission**.
* The petition even names the **CJI and Supreme Court Collegium** as respondents along with the Union Government and several political parties.
* NJAC, although passed unanimously by Parliament and most State legislatures, operated only briefly before being struck down in 2015.

---

### **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

#### **Past Measures**

* **99th Constitutional Amendment and NJAC Act (2014):**

  * A major attempt to reform the judicial appointments process.
  * Reflected political consensus across states and parties.

* **Law Commission Recommendations**

  * Several reports have spoken about the need to ensure transparency and objective criteria in judicial appointments.

* **MoP (Memorandum of Procedure) Negotiations**

  * After striking down NJAC, the SC asked the government to revise the MoP to increase transparency, but finalization remains pending.

#### **Current Context**

* The Union Government has repeatedly expressed concern about:

  * Delays in appointments
  * Lack of transparency in the Collegium
  * Need for a more accountable system
* Periodic debates in Parliament and public forums continue to push for reforms.

---

### **4. Mains Relevance**

#### **Key Issues**

1. **Independence of Judiciary vs. Executive Influence**

   * The central debate is whether giving the government an equal role compromises independence (basic structure) or improves democracy and accountability.

2. **Transparency Deficit**

   * Collegium workings lack objective criteria, public minutes (though some improvements have been made), or written guidelines.

3. **Democratic Legitimacy**

   * Critics argue that judges appointing judges is undemocratic.
   * Supporters claim independence demands judicial primacy.

4. **Basic Structure Doctrine**

   * Revival of NJAC requires navigating the Court’s strong position that judicial primacy is part of basic structure.

5. **Institutional Tensions**

   * Frequent disagreements between Judiciary and Government over appointments impact the functioning of higher courts.

6. **Public Trust and Perception**

   * The ongoing dispute often creates an impression of opacity, friction, and delay.

#### **Broader Implications**

* **Polity:** Debates on separation of powers and constitutional authority.
* **Governance:** Impact on efficiency of judicial system due to vacancies.
* **Ethics:** Appointment process must balance independence with accountability.
* **Society:** Access to speedy justice suffers when appointments are delayed.

---

### **5. Way Forward**

1. **Balanced Model**

   * A modified NJAC ensuring judicial primacy but allowing structured executive participation.
   * Inclusion of eminent persons through a transparent, apolitical mechanism.

2. **Clear Evaluation Criteria**

   * Objective parameters for selection: merit, integrity, diversity, representation from marginalised communities.

3. **Transparency Measures**

   * Publicly available minutes, reasons for selections/non-selections.
   * Annual reports by Collegium or any reformed commission.

4. **Finalize the Memorandum of Procedure (MoP)**

   * Define timelines for government response.
   * Establish a vetting mechanism to avoid indefinite delays.

5. **Strengthen Parliamentary Oversight (Without Judicial Interference)**

   * Committees could review procedural aspects (not candidates) to maintain checks and balances.

6. **Ensure Safeguards Against Executive Overreach**

   * Any revived NJAC structure must protect judiciary from political capture.

7. **Promote Diversity in the Judiciary**

   * Gender, regional, caste, and professional diversity can strengthen legitimacy and trust.

# Over 40 lakh people screened for cancers under Gruha Arogya scheme
## **Gruha Arogya Scheme: Karnataka’s Large-Scale Rural NCD and Cancer Screening Initiative**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

#### **Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs)**

* NCDs include chronic illnesses such as diabetes, hypertension, cancers, mental health disorders, COPD, CKD, neurological diseases, etc.
* They are **slow-progressing**, often **asymptomatic in early stages**, making **early detection critical**.
* In India, NCDs account for nearly **60% of total deaths**.

#### **Cancer Screening**

* Screening for cancers (oral, breast, cervical) helps detect disease early and improves survival.
* Rural India faces challenges such as low awareness, limited access to diagnostic facilities, and socio-cultural barriers.

#### **ASHA and CHO Roles**

* **ASHA workers** are grassroots health workers responsible for community mobilisation, awareness, and preliminary screening.
* **Community Health Officers (CHOs)** at Health & Wellness Centres conduct advanced screening, maintain digital records, and refer suspected cases.

---

### **2. The News**

* Karnataka’s **Gruha Arogya scheme**, expanded statewide in **August 2024**, has screened **40 lakh+ rural residents** (aged 30+) for cancer and major NCDs.

* Between **August 1 and October 31**, findings include:

  * **16,277** suspected cancer cases

* **Rotational cancer screening camps** in rural areas through central funding.

---

### **4. Mains Relevance**

#### **Issues & Challenges**

1. **High Burden of NCDs and Cancers**

   * Late detection leads to high mortality; 25–30% of cancers in Karnataka are tobacco-related.

2. **Rural Health Gaps**

   * Limited diagnostic infrastructure
   * Low awareness about cancer symptoms
   * Cultural stigma, especially for breast and cervical cancer tests

3. **Human Resource Constraints**

   * ASHAs face heavy workload; CHOs require continuous training.
   * Ensuring data accuracy in large-scale digital screening.

4. **Follow-Up and Continuity of Care**

   * Screening is effective only if followed by timely referral, diagnosis, and treatment.
   * Many rural patients face financial, transport, and social barriers to reach tertiary care centres.

5. **Systemic Dependence on Public Infrastructure**

   * SAST and KMIO face high patient loads.
   * Need for decentralization of oncology care.

6. **Tobacco-Linked Burden**

   * Karnataka shows high prevalence of oral cancer due to tobacco chewing and smoking.

#### **Impact**

* **Health:** Early detection reduces mortality and treatment cost.
* **Economy:** NCDs cause major productivity loss among working-age rural population.
* **Governance:** Strengthens preventive healthcare and evidence-based planning.

# Limited room
## **Rupee Depreciation (Nov 2024–Nov 2025): Causes, RBI’s Response, and Policy Challenges**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

#### **Exchange Rate Depreciation**

* When the rupee weakens against the U.S. dollar, it means more rupees are needed for one dollar.
* Example: ₹83.4 → ₹89.2 per USD is a **7% depreciation**.

#### **Managed Float Regime**

* India follows a **floating but managed** exchange rate.
* RBI does not fix the rupee’s value but **intervenes** to prevent excessive volatility.

#### **Dollar-Rupee Swap (Buy-Sell Swap)**

* A tool used by central banks to:

  * Inject rupee liquidity
  * Build/sustain forex reserves
  * Prevent disorderly market movements
* In a buy-sell swap, RBI **buys dollars now** and **sells them later**, effectively supplying rupees to the banking system.

#### **Current Account Deficit (CAD)**

* CAD occurs when imports > exports.
* Higher gold and crude imports widen CAD, increasing demand for foreign currency → rupee comes under pressure.

---

### **2. The News**

* Between **late November 2024 and now**, the rupee has depreciated **about 7%**, sliding from **₹83.4 to ₹89.2 per USD**.
* This mirrors past pressure periods — notably **2018**, when the rupee slid **11–12%** amid global dollar strength.
* The present depreciation is caused by:

  * **Strong U.S. dollar**
  * **High U.S. interest rates**
  * **Trade tensions** and **tariff pressures** affecting exporters
  * **Widening CAD** due to higher bullion imports
* The RBI has attempted to stabilise the rupee:

  * Conducted a **$10 billion buy-sell swap in Feb 2025**
  * Sold **$50 billion** in the forex market between Nov 2024–Nov 2025
  * These interventions slowed the slide but could not stop it because of strong external pressures.
* Despite depreciation, India’s **forex reserves are high** (~$693 billion).
* Domestic inflation is extremely low: **0.25% CPI (Oct 2025)**.
* Depreciation + costlier oil (shift from Russian crude → U.S. crude) poses inflation risks.
* The article stresses that **monetary measures alone cannot fix structural weaknesses** — particularly India’s heavy dependence on imported oil.
* Trade agreements (Japan, UAE, ASEAN) have **not improved India’s trade balance**, raising questions about current trade strategy.

---

### **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

#### **Monetary Actions by RBI**

* **Forex Market Sales (~$50 billion)** to offset excessive depreciation.
* **Buy-Sell Dollar Swaps**:

  * $5 billion swap in 2019
  * $10 billion swap in Feb 2025
* **Managed-float policy** to smoothen volatility.
* Maintaining **comfortable reserves** (~$693 billion) to assure market stability.

#### **Trade & Energy Policies**

* **Oil import diversification**: earlier reliance on discounted Russian crude kept inflation low.
* Gradual shift to costlier U.S. crude raises import bill.
* Government efforts on:

  * **Ethanol blending**
  * **Hydrogen mission**
  * **Solar mission**
  * **FAME scheme** (EV adoption)
* However, trade agreements (Japan, UAE, ASEAN) have resulted in **unfavourable trade balances**, highlighting inefficiencies.

#### **Structural Reforms**

* Promotion of **domestic manufacturing** under Make in India/PLI schemes.
* Push for **renewable energy**, EVs, and reducing crude dependency.

---

### **4. Mains Relevance**

#### **Issues & Challenges**

1. **External Vulnerability**

   * U.S. high-interest environment → capital outflows from emerging markets.
   * Dollar strength leads to global currency depreciation.

2. **Oil Dependence**

   * India imports ~85% of its crude.
   * Depreciation makes oil even costlier → inflation risk.

3. **Trade Imbalances**

   * FTAs have not improved export competitiveness.
   * High tariffs on Indian goods by the U.S. reduce competitiveness.

4. **CAD Widening**

   * Driven by gold imports and high crude imports.
   * Weakens rupee due to higher foreign currency demand.

5. **Limits of RBI Intervention**

   * RBI cannot target a specific exchange rate.
   * Heavy intervention can deplete reserves and distort markets.

6. **Inflation and Monetary Policy Dilemma**

   * Ultra-low CPI (0.25%) gives policy room.
   * But imported inflation risk from oil remains.

7. **Geopolitical Uncertainty**

   * Trade wars, U.S. tariffs, and global slowdown hurt India’s export sector.

#### **Impacts**

* **Economic**: Higher import bills, pressure on fiscal deficit, potential inflation spike.
* **Social**: Rising fuel costs affect transport, food supply chain, household budgets.
* **Business**: Exporters gain from weaker rupee but face tariff pressures; importers face rising costs.
* **Governance**: Highlights the need for coordinated monetary + fiscal + trade strategies.

---

### **5. Way Forward**

1. **Reduce Oil Dependence (Strategic Priority)**

   * Accelerate EV ecosystem: charging infra, battery manufacturing, fleet electrification.
   * Expand renewable energy capacity.
   * Scale up green hydrogen and biofuel blending.

2. **Strengthen Export Competitiveness**

   * Shift from tariff-based protection to productivity-based competitiveness.
   * Encourage logistics efficiencies, reduce compliance costs.

3. **Rethink Trade Policy**

   * Evaluate FTAs based on sectoral impacts, not headline trade volumes.
   * Pursue comprehensive trade strategy rather than ad-hoc bilateral deals.

4. **Boost Domestic Manufacturing**

   * Strengthen PLI schemes with focus on technology transfer and supply-chain resilience.
   * Improve ease of doing business and reduce input costs.

5. **Enhance Foreign Exchange Stability**

   * Continue cautious interventions; avoid defending any particular rate.
   * Build hedging mechanisms for oil and gold.
   * Expand rupee trade settlement avenues.

6. **Fiscal-Monetary Coordination**

   * Combine RBI’s liquidity management with government’s fiscal support for key sectors.
   * Avoid excessive subsidisation of fuel but rationalise tax structure during high volatility.

7. **Diversify Energy and Trade Partners**

   * Negotiate long-term crude contracts with a wider group of countries.
   * Reduce dependence on politically sensitive regions.

8. **Promote Gold Alternatives**

   * Boost instruments like Gold ETFs, sovereign gold bonds to reduce physical gold imports.

# Presidential opinion versus the federal structure
## **Supreme Court’s 16th Presidential Reference: Federalism, Governors’ Powers, and Constitutional Concerns**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

#### **Federalism in India**

* India follows **cooperative federalism**, where powers are divided between the Union and States under the Constitution.

* Although India is not a classical federation (like the U.S.), the Constitution ensures:

  * **Clear division of powers** (Union, State, Concurrent Lists)
  * **Autonomy of States in State subjects**
  * **Limited Union interference** unless in exceptional circumstances

* **Federalism is part of the Basic Structure**, as held in *S.R. Bommai vs Union of India (1994)*.

#### **Role of Governors (Article 153–201)**

* Governors are appointed by the President on the advice of the Union Government.
* Their constitutional functions include:

  * Giving assent to State Bills
  * Reserving Bills for Presidential consideration
  * Returning Bills for reconsideration
* However, these powers are intended to be **limited**, **reasonable**, and not politically motivated.

#### **Presidential References (Article 143)**

* The President may seek the Supreme Court’s opinion on questions of constitutional law of public importance.
* The **16th Presidential reference** concerned:

  * Governor’s discretion
  * Timelines under Article 200
  * Whether long delays or reservation of Bills violate federalism

---

### **2. The News**

* The Supreme Court recently delivered its opinion on the **16th Presidential reference** regarding **Governor and President’s powers**, especially under Article 200 (assent to State Bills).
* Critics argue:

  * The Court’s opinion **expanded the discretionary authority** of Governors.
  * It did **not impose clear timelines** for Governors to act on Bills.
  * It accepted the idea of **“limited directions”** and **implicit discretionary spaces**, allowing Governors to hold Bills indefinitely.
* This decision, according to the article, threatens India’s **federal balance**, giving Governors excessive power over elected State governments.
* The article warns that, without timelines, the Governor becomes an **unelected veto player**, undermining democratic mandate.
* It also situates this opinion within a **larger pattern of centralisation**, citing GST compensation, cess usage, conditional central schemes, misuse of investigative agencies, and political influence.

---

### **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

#### **Constitutional Provisions**

* **Article 200**: Governor may assent, withhold, return, or reserve a Bill.
* **Article 201**: President decides on Bills reserved by Governor.
* **Article 163**: Governor acts on aid and advice of Council of Ministers except in areas requiring discretion.

#### **Supreme Court Interventions (Past & Present)**

* **S.R. Bommai (1994)**: Federalism = Basic structure; Governor cannot misuse powers.
* **Nabam Rebia (2016)**: Governor cannot act independently without specific constitutional authorization.
* **2023–24 judgments (e.g., TN Governor case)**:

  * Mandated that Governors must act **within reasonable time**; cannot delay Bills indefinitely.

#### **Recent Presidential Reference Opinion**

* The Supreme Court’s 16th reference opinion (as criticized) emphasizes:

  * Governors having certain “unwritten” discretionary powers.
  * No explicit timelines for assent.
  * Legitimizing “limited directions” to State governments.

#### **Centre’s Broader Federal Policies**

* **GST Regime**: Issues over compensation to States.
* **Cess & surcharge usage**: Not shareable with States → reduces State fiscal space.
* **Finance Commission deviations**: Concerns over incomplete implementation of devolution.
* **Conditional central schemes**: High State contribution (up to 50%) for centrally sponsored schemes.
* **Political financial transfers**: Example: Cash transfer to 1.21 crore women in Bihar before elections; special package to Andhra Pradesh.
* **Use of central agencies**: CBI, ED, IT for political pressure.

These are cited as **structural attacks on federalism**.

---

### **4. Mains Relevance**

#### **Key Issues**

1. **Erosion of Federal Balance**

   * Allowing Governors to indefinitely delay or reserve Bills shifts power from elected State governments to appointed Governors.

2. **Democratic Deficit**

   * Unelected Governors overriding or obstructing the mandate of a democratically elected legislature.

3. **Rise of Centralisation**

   * Increasing financial, administrative, and political control by the Union over States.

4. **Threat to Basic Structure**

   * Federalism and Judicial Review are core components of the basic structure.
   * Unlimited Governor discretion threatens both.

5. **Administrative Paralysis**

   * Bills kept pending → policy implementation stalled.
   * Elected governments forced into continuous litigation.

6. **Misuse of Institutional Mechanisms**

   * Investigative agencies, conditional grants, and central control of appointments reinforce Union dominance.

7. **Precedent for Future Abuse**

   * Once such power is sanctioned by courts, it can easily be misused by successive governments.

#### **Broader Implications**

* **Polity:** Weakening cooperative federalism; reducing States to administrative units.
* **Governance:** Legislative gridlock; increased dependency on Centre.
* **Finance:** States constrained by reduced fiscal autonomy and lowered devolution.
* **Society:** The will of the people of States becomes secondary to political decisions at the Centre.
* **Ethics:** Violates principles of reasonableness, non-arbitrariness, and fairness.

---

### **5. Way Forward**

1. **Introduce Clear Constitutional Timelines**

   * Amend Article 200 or interpret it judicially to mandate:

     * Maximum 2–4 weeks for assent, return, or reservation.
   * Prevents indefinite sitting on Bills.

2. **Reaffirm Governor’s Limited Role**

   * Governors must act strictly on **aid and advice** of State Cabinet except in narrowly defined discretionary matters.
   * Codify this through guidelines or legislation.

3. **Strengthen Federal Forums**

   * Empower Inter-State Council and Zonal Councils for dispute resolution.
   * Regular meetings to address Centre–State frictions.

4. **Reform Governor Appointment Process**

   * Bipartisan consultation between Union and State governments for appointment.
   * Merit-based selection; fixed code of conduct.

5. **Financial Federalism Reforms**

   * Share cesses and surcharges with States.
   * Strengthen GST Council decision-making.
   * Implement Finance Commission recommendations fully.

6. **Judicial Safeguards**

   * Courts must retain robust judicial review over:

     * Delay in Bill assent
     * Misuse of discretionary powers
     * Politically motivated actions by Governors

7. **Reduce Central Overreach**

   * Limit misuse of CBI/ED/IT for political gains.
   * Ensure neutrality of federal investigative agencies.

8. **Promote Cooperative Federalism**

   * Centre–State collaboration in policy-making.
   * Transparent fiscal transfers.
   * Encourage best practices among States rather than coercive uniformity.

# CJI calls for national judicial policy to reduce divergence
## **Call for a National Judicial Policy: Enhancing Coherence and Access to Justice**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

#### **Judicial Federalism in India**

* India has a **unitary judiciary** but **federal court structure**:

  * **25 High Courts** with their own territorial jurisdictions
  * **Supreme Court** as the apex court
* While the Constitution expects consistency in interpretation, High Courts often issue **divergent rulings** on similar questions of law.

#### **Judicial Policy**

* A national judicial policy can refer to:

  * Common procedural standards
  * Uniform interpretation of constitutional principles
  * Harmonised administrative practices
  * Shared digital, linguistic, and infrastructural frameworks
* Purpose: Reduce unpredictability and ensure citizens receive **consistent justice outcomes** regardless of State.

#### **Access to Justice**

* Means more than legal rights; includes:

  * Affordability
  * Physical accessibility
  * Language inclusivity
  * Timely disposal
* Many marginalised groups experience justice as **complex, expensive, and distant**.

#### **Mediation**

* An alternative dispute resolution (ADR) mechanism.
* Faster, voluntary, participatory, and less adversarial.
* Reduces burden on courts and provides humane solutions.

### **4. Mains Relevance**

#### **Issues & Challenges**

1. **Divergent High Court Rulings**

   * Different interpretations of key laws (e.g., PMLA bail, reservation laws, cybercrime regulation, marriage laws, internet shutdowns).
   * Creates confusion, forum-shopping, delays final resolution.

2. **Unpredictability and Legal Instability**

   * Businesses, governments, and citizens face uncertainty.
   * Weakens the uniformity of constitutional rights across states.

3. **Judicial Infrastructure Gaps**

   * Shortage of courtrooms, judges, support staff.
   * Backlogs exceeding **4.4 crore cases**.

4. **Barriers to Access**

   * High litigation cost.
   * Language barriers — English used in higher courts.
   * Rural-urban divide.

5. **Fragmented Judicial Governance**

   * No coordinated national framework for training, technology, timelines, data collection, or case management.

6. **Underutilised ADR Mechanisms**

   * Mediation and conciliation remain peripheral despite lower cost and time advantages.

#### **Impacts**

* **Governance:** Judicial delays impede policy implementation and economic activity.
* **Economy:** Contract enforcement becomes sluggish; affects investor confidence.
* **Society:** Marginalised groups remain alienated from the justice system.
* **Polity:** Strengthening rule of law requires predictable and consistent judicial outcomes.
