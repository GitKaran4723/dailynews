# India posts 8.2% Q2 GDP growth, tops six quarters
## **India’s Q2 GDP Growth at 8.2% (FY 2025–26)**

---

## **1. Basic Understanding**

### **What is GDP?**

* **Gross Domestic Product (GDP)** measures the total value of goods and services produced within a country during a specific period.
* **Real GDP**: Adjusted for inflation. Shows true growth in actual output.
* **Nominal GDP**: Not adjusted for inflation. Influenced by price changes.
* **GDP Deflator**: Measures inflation by comparing nominal GDP to real GDP. A **low deflator** indicates low inflation.

### **Why GDP Matters?**

* Indicates overall economic health.
* Guides fiscal policy, monetary policy, investment decisions.
* Influences government revenue, fiscal deficit targets, employment prospects.

---

## **2. The News**

* India's **GDP grew by 8.2%** in **Q2 of FY 2025–26 (July–September)** — the highest in **six quarters**.
* The last higher growth was in **Q4 of FY 2023–24**.
* This is higher than:

  * **5.6%** growth in Q2 last year
  * **7.8%** in Q1 of the current year
* Growth in **H1 of FY 2025–26** stands at **8%**.
* **Drivers**: Strong performance in **manufacturing and services**.
* PM Modi hailed the growth, attributing it to **pro-growth reforms**.
* Economists, however, highlight concerns:

  * **Nominal GDP growth is only 8.7%**, suggesting subdued underlying activity.
  * A **low GDP deflator** boosted real GDP figures.
* Lower nominal growth may hinder the government’s ability to meet the **4.4% fiscal deficit target**, as nominal GDP was assumed to grow **10.1%**.
* The **IMF recently rated India’s national accounts with grade ‘C’**, adding political and analytical debate.

---

## **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

### **Reforms supporting recent growth**

* **PLI Scheme (Production-Linked Incentives)** → boosted manufacturing competitiveness.
* **PM Gati Shakti National Master Plan** → improved logistics efficiency.
* **Make in India 2.0** → encourages domestic manufacturing and investment.

---

## **4. Mains Relevance**

### **Issues & Challenges**

1. **Low Nominal GDP Growth**

   * Nominal growth (8.7%) is significantly below expectations.
   * Reflects lower price levels or weak demand-led inflation—indicative of structural softness.

2. **Fiscal Deficit Pressure**

   * Fiscal deficit target of **4.4%** is based on **10.1% nominal growth**.
   * If nominal GDP stays low, government revenue-to-GDP ratio weakens.

3. **Uneven Sectoral Recovery**

   * Services and manufacturing contributed heavily, but:

     * Agriculture is under stress due to monsoon variability.
     * Rural consumption remains slow.

4. **Employment Concerns**

   * High GDP growth does not necessarily translate into **high employment growth**.
   * Manufacturing growth often comes with automation.

5. **Statistical Credibility Debate**

   * IMF’s ‘C’ grade for national accounts → questions over data quality & transparency.
   * Domestic data credibility is crucial for investors and rating agencies.

6. **High Growth on Low Deflator Base**

   * Real GDP inflated because of unusually low deflator.
   * Can create a mismatch between ground reality and macro numbers.

### **Impact Dimensions**

* **Economy**: High real growth boosts investor sentiment but low nominal growth affects fiscal consolidation.
* **Polity**: Government highlights reforms; opposition questions data credibility.
* **Society**: Growth may not immediately translate into improved wages or rural prosperity.
* **Governance**: Data transparency and statistical independence become policy issues.

---

# Data deficiencies
## **IMF’s ‘C’ Grade for India’s National Accounts Statistics**

---

## **1. Basic Understanding**

### **What are National Accounts?**

National accounts provide a **comprehensive statistical description of an economy**. They include:

* **GDP & GVA**
* **Sectoral output** (agriculture, industry, services)
* **Investment levels**
* **Consumption trends**
* **Exports & imports**
* **Saving patterns**

These datasets are essential for:

* Monetary and fiscal policymaking
* Budget planning
* Understanding growth trends
* International comparisons

### **What is the IMF’s Data Quality Assessment Framework (DQAF)?**

* IMF periodically grades countries’ statistical systems.
* Grades typically range from **A (highest)** to **D (lowest)**.
* A **‘C’ grade** means *significant shortcomings impair reliable economic surveillance*.
* It signals issues in data accuracy, timeliness, comprehensiveness, and methodology.

### **Why is Base Year Important?**

* Base year should reflect **current consumption patterns, technology, production structure**.
* If outdated, growth rates, inflation, and sectoral contributions become misleading.

India’s national accounts, CPI, and IIP **still use 2011–12** as base year → outdated by over a decade.

---

## **2. The News**

* The **IMF has given India’s national accounts a ‘C’ grade**, the second-lowest ranking.
* This places India in the same category as **China**, which has faced longstanding credibility issues in economic data.
* IMF notes:

  * Base year (2011–12) is **too old**.
  * Outdated methodologies **hinder surveillance** of the Indian economy.
  * Delays in updating indices such as **IIP** and **CPI** add to this problem.
* The **CPI received a ‘B’ grade**, not ‘A’, because:

  * Base year is old
  * Food has excessive weight, distorting inflation measurement
* RBI’s monetary policy may be impacted because inflation is not captured accurately.
* The Government is now revising base years for:

  * **National Accounts**
  * **CPI**
  * **IIP**
    New series expected by **early 2026**.
* Major structural issue: **inability to capture the informal sector** accurately.
* Positive reforms:

  * MCA-21 database improved corporate sector coverage
  * Planned use of **GST data** will further refine GDP estimation
* IMF says delays in updating data series have significant policy consequences.

---

## **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

### **1. Ongoing Methodological Revisions (Due 2026)**

* Updating base years for GDP, CPI, IIP to reflect:

  * Current consumption patterns
  * Changing industrial structure
  * New technologies and services
* Revising survey methodologies across NSSO and CSO.

### **4. Strengthening Statistical Architecture**

* Role of **National Statistical Commission (NSC)**.
* Rationalisation of statistical processes under the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI).

### **5. Transparency & Data Timeliness**

* Plans to reduce delays in releasing new data series.
* Harmonisation with global statistical standards (SNA 2008).

---

## **4. Mains Relevance**

### **Issues & Challenges**

#### **1. Outdated Statistical Base**

* Using **2011–12 base year** for GDP, CPI, IIP → misrepresents real structural shifts.
* High growth or low inflation may partially be *statistical illusions*.

#### **2. Inaccurate Inflation Measurement**

* Excessive weight of food in CPI (owing to old consumption basket).
* Understates or overstates inflation → **monetary policy errors**.

#### **3. Informal Sector Blind Spots**

* India’s informal sector contributes **45–50% of GDP** and **80–90% of employment**.
* Poor estimation leads to:

  * Misleading GDP numbers
  * Weak understanding of household incomes
  * Poor design of welfare programs

#### **4. Data Timeliness & Credibility**

* Long delays reduce relevance.
* International investors rely on credible, timely data for decisions.
* IMF’s ‘C’ affects India’s perception in global financial markets.

#### **5. Policy Impairment**

* Faulty data leads to:

  * Incorrect fiscal targets
  * Suboptimal monetary tightening/loosening
  * Misaligned welfare policies

#### **6. Comparability Issues**

* India’s data must align with global standards (SNA 2008).
* Methodological gaps hinder comparison with G20 economies.

# The ‘impartiality’ of a nominated Governor
## **Debate on the Role of Governors: Supreme Court’s Judgment and Constituent Assembly Spirit**

---

## **1. Basic Understanding**

### **Who is a Governor?**

* The Governor is the **Constitutional head of a State**, appointed by the President under **Article 155**.
* Functions broadly include:

  * Acting **on the aid and advice** of the Council of Ministers (**Article 163**).
  * Constitutional duties such as summoning the legislature, giving assent to Bills, recommending President’s Rule, etc.
* The office was modeled on the **Westminster system**, intended to be **neutral, ceremonial, and non-political**.

### **Constituent Assembly’s Vision**

The Assembly debated the Governor’s role extensively between 1947–49.
Key concerns included:

* Whether a nominated Governor would become an **agent of the Centre**.
* Whether discretionary powers would revive the **colonial legacy** of the Government of India Act, 1935.
* Whether Governors could override elected legislatures.

**Dr. B.R. Ambedkar’s clarifications shaped the final design:**

* Governor is a **“purely constitutional Governor”**.
* Must **act on Cabinet advice** in all but a few explicitly listed matters.
* Cannot be an **“interfering authority”**.
* Any discretionary power is **limited**, not general or overriding.

This set the framework for India’s federal parliamentary democracy.

---

## **2. The News**

* Recent **Supreme Court judgments** on the role of Governors and the **advisory opinion in the 16th Presidential Reference** have rekindled debate.
* These rulings concern:

  * Governor’s power to withhold assent
  * Delays in granting assent
  * Scope of discretionary powers
  * Constitutional morality in federal functioning
* The debate becomes symbolic as the **Constitution was adopted on November 26, 1949**, and the issues highlight tensions between the **text** and **spirit** of the Constitution.
* Several incidents across Opposition-ruled States show Governors:

  * Delaying assent to Bills
  * Reserving routine Bills for the President
  * Acting contrary to Cabinet advice
* Critics argue this behavior violates the original intent expressed by Ambedkar and the Constituent Assembly.

---

## **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

### **1. Constitutional Provisions**

* **Articles 153–161** regulate the Governor’s office.
* **Article 163** outlines the Governor’s discretionary powers—but only in matters where the Constitution explicitly grants discretion.
* **Article 200**:

  * Governor may give assent, withhold assent, return the Bill (if not Money Bill), or reserve it for the President.
* **Article 356**: Governor reports breakdown of constitutional machinery.

### **2. Judicial Interventions**

* **Nabam Rebia (2016)**: Discretion is limited; Governor must follow Cabinet advice.
* **Shamsher Singh (1974)**: Governor is a constitutional figurehead.
* Recent advisory on **16th Presidential reference**—clarifies boundaries between Governor and elected government.

### **3. Efforts for Cooperative Federalism**

* Inter-State Council revival
* Guidelines on Governor-state relationships by Sarkaria Commission, Punchhi Commission
* Parliamentary committees recommending time-bound assent to Bills

---

## **4. Mains Relevance**

### **Issues & Challenges**

#### **1. Misuse of Discretionary Powers**

* Governors often act beyond the **narrow discretion** intended by the Constitution (e.g., delays, withholding assent).
* Behaviors resemble colonial-era powers under the **1935 Act**, which members of the Assembly had warned against.

#### **2. Erosion of Federal Morality**

* Withholding or delaying assent **“as late as possible”** undermines the principle that Governor is **not a parallel authority**.
* Damages trust between Centre and States.

#### **3. Ambedkar’s Vision vs Present Reality**

* Ambedkar said:

  * *Governor is not an agent of the Centre*
  * *Governor cannot sit in judgment over Bills*
  * *Governor must act on advice unless Constitution explicitly provides discretion*
* Present-day conduct contradicts these principles.

#### **4. Judicial Ambiguity**

* Courts sometimes hesitate to lay down **clear timelines** or **binding restrictions**, which leads to misuse.
* Judicial restraint allows Governors to interpret phrases like **“as soon as possible”** arbitrarily.

#### **5. Constitutional Design vs Human Conduct**

* Dr. Ambedkar warned: “If things go wrong… **Man will be vile**.”
* K.R. Narayanan questioned whether the Constitution failed or **we failed the Constitution**.

This reinforces the need to uphold constitutional morality, not merely textual provisions.

## **5. Way Forward**

### **1. Time-bound Framework for Assent to Bills**

* Amend Article 200 or frame judicial guidelines to ensure:

  * Assent / Return of Bill within **specified time** (e.g., 60 or 90 days).
  * Prevent indefinite delays.

### **2. Codify Governor’s Functions**

* Clear rules defining:

  * What constitutes “discretion”.
  * What actions require Cabinet advice.
* Adopt recommendations from **Sarkaria & Punchhi Commissions**.

### **3. Strengthen Federalism**

* Institutional mechanisms like the **Inter-State Council**, **Zonal Councils**, and **regular Centre–State dialogues**.
* Ensure Governors act as **neutral constitutional umpires**, not political actors.

### **4. Judicial Clarification**

* Supreme Court should interpret:

  * Meaning of “as soon as possible” under Article 200
  * Boundaries of discretion
  * Safeguards against arbitrary reservation of Bills
* Courts must protect the **spirit of parliamentary democracy**.

### **5. Reform Governor Appointments**

* Consider transparent criteria:

  * Eminent persons with administrative or academic experience

# The ‘impartiality’ of a nominated Governor
## **Debate on the Role of Governors: Supreme Court’s Judgment and Constituent Assembly Spirit**

---

## **1. Basic Understanding**

### **Who is a Governor?**

* The Governor is the **Constitutional head of a State**, appointed by the President under **Article 155**.
* Functions broadly include:

  * Acting **on the aid and advice** of the Council of Ministers (**Article 163**).
  * Constitutional duties such as summoning the legislature, giving assent to Bills, recommending President’s Rule, etc.
* The office was modeled on the **Westminster system**, intended to be **neutral, ceremonial, and non-political**.

### **Constituent Assembly’s Vision**

The Assembly debated the Governor’s role extensively between 1947–49.
Key concerns included:

* Whether a nominated Governor would become an **agent of the Centre**.
* Whether discretionary powers would revive the **colonial legacy** of the Government of India Act, 1935.
* Whether Governors could override elected legislatures.

**Dr. B.R. Ambedkar’s clarifications shaped the final design:**

* Governor is a **“purely constitutional Governor”**.
* Must **act on Cabinet advice** in all but a few explicitly listed matters.
* Cannot be an **“interfering authority”**.
* Any discretionary power is **limited**, not general or overriding.

This set the framework for India’s federal parliamentary democracy.

---

## **2. The News**

* Recent **Supreme Court judgments** on the role of Governors and the **advisory opinion in the 16th Presidential Reference** have rekindled debate.
* These rulings concern:

  * Governor’s power to withhold assent
  * Delays in granting assent
  * Scope of discretionary powers
  * Constitutional morality in federal functioning
* The debate becomes symbolic as the **Constitution was adopted on November 26, 1949**, and the issues highlight tensions between the **text** and **spirit** of the Constitution.
* Several incidents across Opposition-ruled States show Governors:

  * Delaying assent to Bills
  * Reserving routine Bills for the President
  * Acting contrary to Cabinet advice
* Critics argue this behavior violates the original intent expressed by Ambedkar and the Constituent Assembly.

---

## **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

### **1. Constitutional Provisions**

* **Articles 153–161** regulate the Governor’s office.
* **Article 163** outlines the Governor’s discretionary powers—but only in matters where the Constitution explicitly grants discretion.
* **Article 200**:

  * Governor may give assent, withhold assent, return the Bill (if not Money Bill), or reserve it for the President.
* **Article 356**: Governor reports breakdown of constitutional machinery.

### **2. Judicial Interventions**

* **Nabam Rebia (2016)**: Discretion is limited; Governor must follow Cabinet advice.
* **Shamsher Singh (1974)**: Governor is a constitutional figurehead.
* Recent advisory on **16th Presidential reference**—clarifies boundaries between Governor and elected government.

### **3. Efforts for Cooperative Federalism**

* Inter-State Council revival
* Guidelines on Governor-state relationships by Sarkaria Commission, Punchhi Commission
* Parliamentary committees recommending time-bound assent to Bills

---

## **4. Mains Relevance**

### **Issues & Challenges**

#### **1. Misuse of Discretionary Powers**

* Governors often act beyond the **narrow discretion** intended by the Constitution (e.g., delays, withholding assent).
* Behaviors resemble colonial-era powers under the **1935 Act**, which members of the Assembly had warned against.

#### **2. Erosion of Federal Morality**

* Withholding or delaying assent **“as late as possible”** undermines the principle that Governor is **not a parallel authority**.
* Damages trust between Centre and States.

#### **3. Ambedkar’s Vision vs Present Reality**

* Ambedkar said:

  * *Governor is not an agent of the Centre*
  * *Governor cannot sit in judgment over Bills*
  * *Governor must act on advice unless Constitution explicitly provides discretion*
* Present-day conduct contradicts these principles.

#### **4. Judicial Ambiguity**

* Courts sometimes hesitate to lay down **clear timelines** or **binding restrictions**, which leads to misuse.
* Judicial restraint allows Governors to interpret phrases like **“as soon as possible”** arbitrarily.

#### **5. Constitutional Design vs Human Conduct**

* Dr. Ambedkar warned: “If things go wrong… **Man will be vile**.”
* K.R. Narayanan questioned whether the Constitution failed or **we failed the Constitution**.

This reinforces the need to uphold constitutional morality, not merely textual provisions.

# India’s disaster response, a slippery slope for federalism
## **Inter-Governmental Disaster Financing and the Drift from Cooperative Federalism**

---

## **1. Basic Understanding**

### **Disaster Financing in India**

India’s disaster-response funding framework is built on the **Disaster Management Act, 2005**, which created a **two-tier system**:

1. **State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF)**

   * Shared between Centre and States:

     * **75:25** for most States
     * **90:10** for Himalayan and north-eastern States
   * Used for **immediate relief**: food, shelter, medical aid, compensation.

2. **National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF)**

   * Entirely funded by the **Union government**.
   * Used when a disaster is classified as **“severe”**, with more funds for relief.

### **What is Cooperative Fiscal Federalism?**

* System where the Union and States share responsibilities and resources.
* Disasters require **joint action and timely transfers**.
* Ideally, funding should be based on **need**, **risk**, and **urgency**, not negotiation.

---

## **2. The News**

* The **Wayanad landslides (July 2024)** killed nearly **300 people** and damaged thousands of homes.
* Kerala assessed losses at **₹2,200 crore**, but the Centre released only **₹260 crore** — just **11%** of the estimated loss.
* The Union cited Kerala’s **unspent SDRF balance** and prior loans as reasons for reducing aid.
* This episode has amplified concerns that India’s disaster financing is becoming **more centralised** and **conditional**, rather than cooperative.
* Procedural issues, delays, and discretionary decision-making reveal a **funding mismatch** between State needs and Union disbursements.
* Similar patterns were seen in **Cyclone Gaja (Tamil Nadu, 2018)** and **Karnataka floods (2019)**.

---

## **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

### **1. Institutional Framework under DMA 2005**

* **NDMA**, **SDMAs**, and **DDMAs** coordinate disaster preparedness and relief.
* Funds allocated through Finance Commissions.

### **2. Role of the Union Government**

* Contributes to SDRF.
* Provides **additional NDRF support** after a central assessment.
* Classifies disasters as “severe”.

### **3. Role of the Finance Commission**

* Determines SDRF allocations every five years.
* Uses criteria such as population, geography and poverty — not actual hazard exposure.

### **4. Recent Union Measures**

* Interest-free loans for capital investment (e.g., Kerala).
* Guidelines on utilisation of SDRF.
* Monitoring of unspent balances.

*(However, these interventions often do not reflect the realities of reconstruction needs.)*

---

## **4. Mains Relevance**

### **A. Challenges in India’s Disaster Financing**

#### **1. Widening Gap Between Needs and Aid**

* States face rising disaster losses due to climate change.
* Union disbursements lag behind needs → fiscal pressure on States.

#### **2. Outdated Relief Norms**

* Compensation ceilings (₹4 lakh for death, ₹1.2 lakh for damaged house) unchanged for a decade.
* Do not cover reconstruction or livelihood loss.

#### **3. Discretion in “Severe” Classification**

* The Act **does not define** what qualifies as a “severe calamity”.
* Leads to inconsistent decisions across States.

#### **4. Procedural, Not Automatic, Support**

* Relief depends on:

  * State memorandum
  * Inter-Ministerial assessment
  * High-level approval
* This sequential process delays aid even in large-scale disasters.

#### **5. Flawed Allocation Formula**

* Current Finance Commission criteria ignore:

  * Hazard maps
  * Landslide/flood exposure
  * Climate vulnerability
* Use of **poverty as a proxy** undervalues risk-prone States like Kerala or Uttarakhand with high disaster intensity but high human development indicators.

### **B. Federalism Concerns**

#### **1. Drift Toward Centralisation**

* Union citing unspent SDRF balances reduces State access to NDRF.
* Delays in “severe” classification limit assistance.
* States increasingly need to **negotiate** instead of receiving predictable relief.

#### **2. Climate Change as a Stress Test**

* Disasters are becoming bigger, more frequent, and more unpredictable.
* States cannot absorb shocks without **timely and adequate federal support**.

#### **3. Erosion of Constitutional Morality**

* Cooperative federalism shifts to conditionality-based transfers.
* States forced to justify themselves during crises rather than receiving solidarity.

---

## **5. Way Forward**

### **1. Introduce Objective, Automatic Triggers for Disaster Aid**

Learn from global best practices:

* **Rainfall intensity thresholds** (like Mexico’s FONDEN)
* **Per capita damage** (FEMA, U.S.)
* **Fatalities per million**
* **Loss-to-GSDP ratio**
* **Satellite-based assessment** (African Risk Capacity model)

Such triggers reduce **discretion**, **delay**, and **political negotiation**.

### **2. Redefine “Severe Disaster” with Clear Criteria**

* Use multi-parameter vulnerability index.
* Include geological risks (landslides), climate risks, infrastructure damage.

### **3. Update Relief Norms and Compensation**

* Align relief with **current reconstruction costs**.
* Expand SDRF/NDRF scope to include **livelihood recovery**, not only immediate relief.

### **4. Reform Finance Commission Criteria**

* Use:

  * Hazard exposure maps (IMD, CWC, GSI)
  * Climate risk indices
  * Urban vulnerability metrics
* Move beyond population and area.

### **5. Strengthen State Autonomy in Disaster Funds**

* States should have operational control over SDRF.
* Union oversight should be **post-auditory**, not **pre-approval**.

### **6. Create a Climate Disaster Mitigation Fund**

* Parallel fund for long-term infrastructure (embankments, slope stabilization, flood control).
* Prevent disasters before they occur.

### **7. Institutionalise Transparency and Timelines**

* Mandate time-bound approvals for NDRF.
* Publish reasons for acceptance/rejection of State claims.
* Annual public audit of disaster allocations.

### **8. Deepen Cooperative Federalism**

* Regular Centre–State coordination meetings.
* Technical advisory boards with representation from disaster-prone States.
* Promote shared responsibility between governments.

---

## **Conclusion**

Disasters not only expose terrain and climate vulnerabilities — they expose **institutional and federal vulnerabilities**. The widening gap between assessed needs and approved aid shows a move toward a **centralised, discretionary, and negotiation-based** system of disaster financing.

To preserve constitutional federalism, India must shift from **procedural charity** to **rules-based partnership**, ensuring predictable, adequate, and timely assistance.

The Wayanad landslide serves as a wake-up call:
**If federalism fails during crises, it fails when it matters most.**
