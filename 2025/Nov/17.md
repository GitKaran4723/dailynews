# Too little, much later
## **Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Rules, 2025: Delays, Dilutions & the Erosion of Privacy**

---

## **1. Basic Understanding**

### **What is the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act?**

Passed in 2023, the DPDP Act is India’s first dedicated data protection law intended to safeguard individuals’ personal data in the digital space.

### **Why is Data Protection Important?**

In the digital age:

* Citizens constantly share data with apps, banks, schools, workplaces, the government, and Big Tech.
* Without safeguards, this data can be misused for surveillance, profiling, monetisation, or discrimination.
* Privacy is a **fundamental right** under Article 21 (Puttaswamy Judgment, 2017).

### **What are DPDP Rules?**

Rules are subordinate legislation needed to operationalise the Act.
The **2025 Rules** were notified on November 14, 2025, but:

* Delay implementation of key protections
* Immediately enforce the dilution of the RTI Act
* Raise concerns about institutional independence

---

## **2. The News**

Eight years after the Supreme Court recognised privacy as a fundamental right, India finally notified its **Digital Personal Data Protection Rules, 2025**. But instead of strengthening privacy protections, the Rules:

* **Delay most safeguards until 2027**
* **Immediately implement restrictions on the Right to Information (RTI)**
* Provide minimal new protections
* Retain wide exemptions for government surveillance and data processing

### **Key Issues Highlighted**

* The final law and Rules give the **government wide authority** over citizens’ data.
* The Data Protection Board of India (DPBI) is institutionally weak:

  * Works **under the Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY)**
  * Is not independent
* The DPDP process lacked transparency — **three drafts** were circulated in earlier years with little explanation on changes.
* The final Rules were released on the day of the **Bihar Assembly election results**, reducing public attention.

### **RTI Dilution**

* Public Information Officers (PIOs) can now **reject any request for personal information**, except what must be disclosed under other laws.
* Weakens the ability of citizens to seek accountability in:

  * Welfare schemes
  * Public expenditure
  * Recruitment and examination processes
  * Local governance

---

## **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

### **Legislative Framework**

* **DPDP Act, 2023:** Main law governing data privacy
* **DPDP Rules, 2025:** Operational guidelines
* **RTI Act Amendment:** Restricts disclosure of personal data
* **Information Technology Act, 2000 & Rules:** Interact with DPDP framework
* **Cert-In Guidelines:** Reporting cyber incidents

### **Institutional Mechanism**

* **Data Protection Board of India (DPBI):**

  * Handles complaints, data breaches, penalties
  * But functions under MeitY, raising concerns of conflict of interest.

### **Government’s Stated Objectives**

* Ease of compliance for industry
* Boosting digital economy
* Streamlining data governance
* Protecting minors’ data

However, critics argue these objectives have overshadowed privacy concerns.

---

## **4. Mains Relevance**

### **a. Issues and Challenges**

#### **1. Threat to Fundamental Right to Privacy**

* Delayed protections (till 2027) mean status quo continues.
* Wide exemptions allow:

  * Government agencies to process data without consent
  * Vague grounds like “national security” and “public order” to bypass safeguards

#### **2. Weak Institutional Independence**

* DPBI under MeitY → conflict of interest:

  * MeitY promotes investments from Big Tech
  * And supervises investigations against them
* Undermines trust and fairness.

#### **3. RTI Dilution**

* “Personal information” can now be withheld easily.
* Will severely affect:

  * Investigation of corruption
  * Transparency in welfare delivery
  * Access to information on government functionaries
* Violates core objective of RTI: transparency in public life.

#### **4. Corporate Compliance Favoured Over Citizen Rights**

* 12–18 months compliance extension even for tech giants.
* Few obligations for data fiduciaries.
* Limited user rights:

  * No right to data portability
  * No right to be forgotten (effectively diluted)
  * No independent grievance mechanism

#### **5. Lack of Transparency in Rule-Making**

* Minimal changes after a 3-month consultation period.
* Final Rules released on a politically sensitive day → reduced scrutiny.
* No clarity on public feedback.

#### **6. State and Big Tech Surveillance**

* Citizens remain “open books”:

  * Government can access data widely
  * Big Tech continues to collect, profile, and monetise data
* Users lack meaningful control.

### **b. Impact on Society & Governance**

* **Privacy:** Erosion of citizens’ autonomy
* **Transparency:** Weakened RTI regime → reduced accountability
* **Economy:** Big Tech gets compliance relief
* **Governance:** Increased centralisation of power
* **Trust:** Decline in public confidence in data governance

---

## **5. Way Forward**

### **1. Strengthen Independence of the Data Protection Board**

* Must function similar to:

  * Election Commission
  * CAG
  * TRAI
* Appointment process should be independent of the executive.

### **2. Restore RTI Strength**

* Amend Rules to:

  * Balance privacy with transparency
  * Allow access to information in public interest
* Follow Supreme Court precedents (Girish Deshpande, Puttaswamy).

### **3. Shorten Implementation Timelines**

* Staggered rollout but not beyond 12 months.
* Big Tech already has global compliance systems (GDPR).

### **4. Narrow Government Exemptions**

* Clear definitions for:

  * National security
  * Public order
  * Public interest
* Mandatory audit trails for government data access.

### **5. Expand User Rights**

* Right to data portability
* Right to be forgotten
* Right to consent withdrawal
* Right to object to profiling

### **6. Transparent Rule-Making**

* Publish stakeholder submissions
* Independent expert committees
* Parliamentary scrutiny

### **7. Public Awareness and Digital Literacy**

* Need mass awareness on:

  * Data rights
  * Privacy settings
  * Reporting mechanisms
  * Consequences of data misuse

### **8. Harmonise DPDP with Other Laws**

* Align with:

  * RTI Act
  * IT Act
  * Consumer Protection Act
  * Aadhaar Act
* Ensure data localisation rules are clear and consistent.

# Delhi’s air, a ‘wicked problem’ in need of bold solutions
## **Delhi’s Winter Air Pollution Crisis: A Structural Public Health Emergency**

---

## **1. Basic Understanding**

### **What is Delhi’s Air Pollution Crisis?**

Each winter, Delhi’s Air Quality Index (AQI) routinely crosses **400 (“Severe”)**, indicating air that is hazardous even for healthy individuals. Schools shut down, flights are disrupted, and hospitals report surges in respiratory emergencies.

Air pollution here is not a **seasonal phenomenon**; it is a **chronic, multi-source, and deeply structural problem**.

### **Why Does Pollution Spike in Winter?**

1. **Meteorological Factors**

   * **Temperature inversion** traps pollutants near the surface.
   * **Low wind speeds** reduce dispersion.
   * The city lies in a **basin-like geography** with the Aravallis acting as barriers.

2. **Anthropogenic Sources**

   * Vehicles (over 3.3 crore in NCR)
   * Construction dust
   * Industrial emissions
   * Stubble burning
   * Waste burning
   * Firecrackers during festivals

### **What Makes This Dangerous?**

Fine particulate matter (**PM2.5**) enters the bloodstream and affects:

* Lungs
* Heart
* Brain
* Autoimmune system

Long-term exposure cuts **life expectancy by up to 10 years**.

---

## **2. The News**

The article highlights how each winter Delhi witnesses a **public health emergency**, yet governance response remains cyclical and reactive. Despite multiple stakeholder round tables, policies, and public debates, **little progress has been made**.

Key highlights:

* Long-term exposure is linked to asthma, COPD, cancers, strokes, hypertension, cognitive decline, depression, and autoimmune diseases.
* Pollution costs India **1.36% of its GDP annually** (~$36.8 billion).
* People are relocating from Delhi due to severe health risks.
* Emergency measures (cloud seeding, air purifiers) divert resources from long-term solutions.

The piece argues that Delhi’s air pollution is a **“wicked problem”** — complex, cross-sectoral, and politically difficult — requiring coordinated, multi-year, science-led action.

# Swing, but do not miss
## **WHO Global TB Report 2025: India’s Mixed Progress Toward TB Elimination**

---

## **1. Basic Understanding**

### **What is Tuberculosis (TB)?**

TB is an infectious disease caused by *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, primarily affecting the lungs but capable of involving other organs. It spreads through air when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks.

### **Key Terms**

* **Incidence:** New TB cases per year per lakh population.
* **Prevalence:** Total number of ongoing infections (new + existing).
* **MDR-TB (Multidrug-Resistant TB):** TB that does not respond to isoniazid and rifampicin, the two most powerful first-line drugs.
* **RR-TB:** TB resistant to rifampicin alone.
* **TB Mortality:** Deaths due to TB per lakh population.

### **Global Context**

The global target under the WHO’s End TB Strategy is to **eliminate TB by 2030**. India set an even more ambitious target: **TB elimination by 2025**, which it is going to miss.

---

## **2. The News**

The **WHO Global Tuberculosis Report 2025** paints a mixed picture for India.

### **Positive Indicators**

* **TB Incidence Down by 21%**
  From 237/lakh (2015) → 187/lakh (2024), the **sharpest decline globally**.
* **TB Mortality Down**
  From 28/lakh (2015) → 21/lakh (2024).
* **High treatment success rate (90%)** for new and relapsed cases.
* Use of **AI tools, molecular diagnostics, nutritional support**, and **newer therapies like BPaLM** has improved case detection and outcomes.

### **Concerning Indicators**

* India still accounts for **25% of global TB cases** — the **highest burden** worldwide.
* India recorded **maximum TB cases globally in 2024**.
* **Highest MDR-/RR-TB burden** in the world (32% of global cases).
* **MDR-/RR-TB treatment success only 77%**.
* TB mortality still **three times the elimination target**.

### **State-Level Breakdown**

* **Highest TB cases:** Uttar Pradesh → Maharashtra → Bihar → Madhya Pradesh
* **Highest prevalence rate:** Delhi
  (high rate but lower absolute numbers)

### **India’s Target**

* TB elimination goal of **2025** is unattainable now.
* The report highlights strengths but also deep structural challenges.

# The POCSO Act is gender-neutral by design
## **Gender Neutrality Under the POCSO Act: Can Women Be Prosecuted for Penetrative Sexual Assault?**

---

## **1. Basic Understanding**

### **What is the POCSO Act?**

The **Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012** is India’s primary law to protect children (below 18 years) from sexual abuse. It defines a wide range of offences including penetrative sexual assault, aggravated assault, sexual harassment, and child pornography.

### **Section 3: Penetrative Sexual Assault**

Under Section 3, penetrative sexual assault includes:

* Penile penetration
* Penetration with objects or fingers
* Oral penetration
* Making a child perform these acts

The section uses the pronoun **“he”**, which has become the basis for the recent petition.

### **The Key Question**

Can women be prosecuted under Section 3 for penetrative sexual assault?

The article argues that **yes**, they can — and should — under law and principles of child protection.

---

## **2. The News**

The Supreme Court recently agreed to hear a petition from a woman accused of **penetrative sexual assault** under POCSO.
She argues that:

* The law is gender-specific
* Section 3 applies only to male perpetrators
* She cannot be prosecuted under this provision

The case raises a foundational question about the nature of India’s child sexual abuse law:
**Is POCSO gender-neutral for both victims and perpetrators?**

### **The Article’s Key Argument**

The POCSO Act is **gender-neutral** for *both* victims and offenders.

To support this conclusion, three major arguments are advanced:

1. Statutory interpretation
2. Legislative intent
3. Normative and child-protection considerations

---

## **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

### **Legislative Framework**

* **POCSO Act, 2012**

  * Protects all children (boys, girls, transgender children).
  * Defines sexual offences broadly.
  * Applies irrespective of gender unless explicitly specified.
* **General Clauses Act, 1897, Section 13(1)**

  * Masculine pronoun (“he”) includes females unless context indicates otherwise.

### **Parliamentary Statements**

* Ministry of Women and Child Development (Lok Sabha, 2024):
  **“POCSO is a gender-neutral Act.”**
* Statement of Objects & Reasons of the 2019 POCSO Amendment Bill:
  **“Gender neutral”** protection is a key objective.

### **Comparison with Other Laws**

* **Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) Section 63** (rape) is explicitly gender-specific:

  * Perpetrator: *man*
  * Victim: *woman*
* POCSO, dealing with the same acts, **contains no such gender-specific language** — indicating deliberate legislative choice.

### **Judicial Position**

* In **Sakshi v. Union of India (2004)**, the Supreme Court emphasized the need to recognise:

  * Broader forms of sexual abuse
  * The vulnerability of children
  * The diversity of perpetrator–victim dynamics

POCSO was designed keeping this jurisprudence in mind.

---

## **4. Mains Relevance**

### **Issues and Challenges**

#### **1. Textual Interpretation**

* Section 3 uses “he”, but:

  * General Clauses Act → masculine includes feminine
  * Section 3 covers acts women can commit (digital/oral penetration, coercing acts with third persons)

#### **2. Legislative Intent**

* POCSO explicitly aims to protect **all children**.
* Parliament did not narrow the provision to male perpetrators, unlike in BNS.

#### **3. Normative and Child Protection Concerns**

* Child sexual abuse is rooted in **power imbalances**, not only biological differences.
* Excluding women as potential perpetrators:

  * Denies justice to victims abused by women
  * Ignores survivor testimonies and research
  * Reinforces stereotypes that women cannot be abusers
  * Undermines the Act’s purpose

#### **4. Concept of Gender Neutrality in Sexual Offences**

* POCSO predates India’s broader shift toward gender-neutral sexual offences (e.g., BNS 2023 amendments in other contexts).
* Reading POCSO as gender-specific contradicts evolving global and Indian jurisprudence.

#### **5. Institutional Responsibility**

* Courts must uphold:

  * Child protection
  * Inclusive jurisprudence
  * Survivors’ rights
  * Legislative intent

---

## **5. Way Forward**

### **1. Affirm Gender Neutrality of POCSO**

* Essential to ensure justice for *all* victims.
* Prevents loopholes allowing female offenders to evade prosecution.

### **2. Promote Sensitization among Enforcement Agencies**

* Police, prosecutors, and judges need training on:

  * Gender-neutral interpretation
  * Child psychology
  * Handling cases where the perpetrator is female

### **3. Strengthen the Text of the Act (Future Reforms)**

* Explicitly state gender neutrality to avoid ambiguity.
* Align POCSO with gender-neutral reforms introduced in other criminal laws.

### **4. Improve Awareness and Reporting**

* Community awareness programmes to:

  * Destigmatize reporting
  * Encourage disclosures where women are perpetrators
  * Address myths about gender and abuse

### **5. Ensure Holistic Child Protection**

* Integrate POCSO implementation with:

  * School awareness programmes
  * Counselling services
  * Support for child witnesses
  * Medical and psychological services

# The legal hoodwinking of Adivasis
## **Cancellation of Ghatbarra’s Community Forest Rights: What the Chhattisgarh HC Judgment Means for Adivasi Justice**

---

## **1. Basic Understanding**

### **What are Community Forest Rights (CFRs)?**

Under the **Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006**, tribal and forest-dwelling communities are entitled to:

* Access, manage, and protect forests
* Use forest produce
* Govern their customary lands through Gram Sabhas

### **Why Are CFRs Crucial?**

For Adivasis, forests are more than land—they are:

* A source of livelihood
* A cultural and spiritual space
* Part of their identity and autonomy

### **Forest Diversion Laws**

Any diversion of forest land for mining or infrastructure requires:

1. **Settlement of forest rights**
2. **Free, prior and informed consent (FPIC)** from affected Gram Sabhas
   This flows from:

* FRA (Section 4 and Rules)
* Forest Conservation Act, 1980
* MoEFCC guidelines since 2009

### **Hasdeo Arand**

One of India’s **largest contiguous forest tracts**, known for:

* Dense forest cover
* Wildlife corridors
* Rich Adivasi habitation
* Large coal reserves
  It has been at the centre of conflicts between mining and community rights.

---

## **2. The News**

Last month, the **Chhattisgarh High Court upheld the cancellation** of the CFR rights granted to **Ghatbarra village** in Hasdeo Arand.

### **Why is this Significant?**

* The community had been fighting for nearly a decade for restoration of their rights.
* While the case was pending, mining was allowed to continue, felling **lakhs of trees**.
* The Court termed the original CFR recognition a **“mistake”** and suggested **monetary compensation**.

The ruling is a major setback for:

* Adivasi self-determination
* Enforcement of the Forest Rights Act
* Environmental justice in ecologically fragile zones

---

## **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

### **Forest Rights Act, 2006**

Key provisions relevant here:

* **Section 4(7):** Forest rights are recognised *free of all encumbrances*.
* **Rule 12(B):** District Level Committees (DLCs) must verify and record reasons if rights are not recognised.
* **Gram Sabha Authority:** Gram Sabhas are the primary authority to determine, verify, and approve rights.

### **Forest Conservation Framework**

* **Forest Conservation Act, 1980**
* **MoEFCC’s 2009 circular:** No forest diversion without settlement of forest rights + Gram Sabha consent.

### **Judicial Precedents**

* **Niyamgiri judgment (2013):** Affirmed Gram Sabha supremacy in matters of customary forest rights and religious/cultural practices.
* **NGT’s 2014 decision:** Set aside forest clearance for the same mine and ordered reconsideration.

### **Administrative Actions**

* The Environment Ministry’s **Forest Advisory Committee (FAC)** initially rejected the project due to:

  * Unsettled forest rights
  * Ecological sensitivity

However, political decisions overturned expert advice.

---

## **4. Mains Relevance**

### **Issues and Challenges**

#### **1. Undermining the FRA’s Core Principles**

The Court held that CFRs were void because the land was already diverted.
But under **Section 4(7)**, diversion **cannot** supersede customary rights; instead, rights must be recognised *free of encumbrances*.

The judgment reverses this logic.

#### **2. Administrative Overreach and Procedural Gaps**

* DLC unilaterally cancelled CFRs without due process.
* Court failed to question the legality of this cancellation.
* No inquiry into irregularities such as:

  * **Forged Gram Sabha consents** (documented in neighbouring Parsa block)
  * Absence of compliance records under FRA rules

#### **3. Judicial Misinterpretation**

* The Court treated CFRs as property rights that can be compensated monetarily.
* But Adivasi relationships with forests are **cultural, ecological, and socio-spiritual**, not merely economic.

#### **4. Violation of Niyamgiri Principles**

Niyamgiri held:

* Gram Sabhas must decide the fate of their forests.
* Their cultural and livelihood rights are constitutionally protected.

In Hasdeo:

* Gram Sabha opposition was ignored.
* Mining proceeded even as cases were pending.

#### **5. Inadequate Consideration of Ecological Harm**

By the time the case was decided:

* **Lakhs of trees had been felled**
* Forest cover lost
* Wildlife corridors disrupted
* Mining became a **fait accompli**, influencing legal outcomes

This embodies the “irreversibility problem” in environmental governance.

#### **6. Locus Standi Concerns**

The Court dismissed villagers’ locus standi, although:

* CFRs belong to the village community
* Petitioners were aggrieved directly
* Divergence order had been set aside earlier by NGT

This further alienates forest communities from judicial remedy.

---

### **Impacts**

#### **Social & Cultural**

* Loss of Adivasi autonomy
* Cultural practices disrupted
* Deep distrust in institutions

#### **Economic**

* Communities lose access to minor forest produce
* Long-term livelihood loss
* Compensation fails to account for ecological services

#### **Environmental**

* Biodiversity destruction
* Soil degradation
* Increased carbon emissions
* Loss of ecological integrity in Hasdeo Arand

---

## **5. Way Forward**

### **1. Enforce the FRA Robustly**

* Recognise CFRs *before* considering diversion.
* Ensure Gram Sabha consent is genuine, documented, and independently verified.

### **2. Strengthen District Level Committees**

* Mandatory transparency: minutes, reasons, and orders must be issued and publicly accessible.
* Independent oversight to prevent unilateral cancellations.

### **3. Prevent “Fait Accompli” Scenarios**

* Stay orders must halt mining; violations must attract penalties.
* Courts must prioritise time-bound hearings in environmental matters.

### **4. Enhance Accountability Mechanisms**

* Independent inquiry into:

  * Forged Gram Sabha resolutions
  * Irregular clearance processes
  * Violations of NGT or SC orders

### **5. Centre–State Coordination for Ecological Protection**

* Identify and notify “No-Go” forest areas like Hasdeo Arand.
* Revisit environmental clearance norms for mining in dense forests.

### **6. Recognize Adivasi Worldviews**

* Policy frameworks must respect the idea that forests are:

  * Sacred
  * Communal
  * Living ecosystems
    — not merely extractive resources.

### **7. Judicial Sensitization**

* Courts must be trained in:

  * FRA jurisprudence
  * Adivasi rights
  * Ecological principles

### **8. Promote Alternatives to Mining**

* Renewable energy
* Circular economy initiatives
* Just transition frameworks for coal-dependent states

# India to spruce up mechanisms for accessing climate finance
## **India’s New “Climate & Nature Finance Platform” at COP30: Strengthening Access to Global Climate Funds**

---

## **1. Basic Understanding**

### **What is the Green Climate Fund (GCF)?**

The **GCF** is the world’s largest dedicated climate finance fund, created under the UNFCCC.
Its purpose is to channel financial support from developed to developing countries for:

* **Mitigation** (clean energy, low-carbon transitions)
* **Adaptation** (climate resilience, agriculture, coastal protection, water management)

### **Why Was the GCF Created?**

To operationalise the principle of **Common but Differentiated Responsibilities (CBDR-RC)** and fulfil the Paris Agreement’s obligations, especially Article 9.1, which mandates developed countries to provide climate finance.

### **Key Issues with GCF**

Despite having **$19 billion committed**, only **25% has been properly allocated** (as of 2024).
Problems include:

* Complex procedures
* Lengthy project approvals
* Weak technical support for developing countries
* Disproportionate focus on mitigation funding over adaptation

### **What is a Country Platform?**

A **national-level coordination mechanism** that:

* Helps pool domestic and international finance
* Aligns ministries, private sector, and state governments
* Strengthens technical expertise
* Speeds up access to climate and nature-related funds
* Reduces fragmentation in project proposals

---

## **2. The News**

At **COP30 in Belém, Brazil**, India joined **13 countries** and the **African Islands States Climate Commission (AISCC)** in announcing plans to create a **“Climate and Nature Finance Country Platform”** coordinated through the **GCF**.

### **Purpose of India’s Platform**

* Reduce fragmented approaches to climate finance
* Improve access to GCF funds
* Align priorities for both mitigation and adaptation
* Strengthen India’s negotiating position at COP30
* Support India’s forthcoming **National Adaptation Plan**

### **Global Significance**

* Total platforms now stand at **16**, including earlier ones in **Brazil** and the **Caribbean**.
* Countries such as Colombia, Mongolia, Nigeria, Oman, and Kazakhstan have similar plans.

### **COP30 Context**

* Negotiations this year are heavily focused on:

  * **Climate finance access**
  * **Adaptation scaling**
  * Finalising the **Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA)** indicators
* Experts have spent two years narrowing **10,000 indicators → 100**, which may be adopted at COP30.

---

## **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

### **India’s Climate Finance Engagement with GCF**

* As of **August 2024**, India has secured:

  * **11 GCF-backed projects**
  * Total commitment: **$782 million**
  * Sectors:

    * Water security
    * Clean energy
    * Coastal resilience
    * Climate-resilient livelihoods
    * Transport and MSMEs
    * Green start-ups
* Bulk of funding is through **concessional loans**.

### **Domestic Institutional Framework**

* **Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC)** is India’s:

  * **National Designated Authority (NDA)** for GCF
  * Key decision-maker on eligible projects

### **National Adaptation Plan (Upcoming)**

* Expected to be released soon
* Will guide:

  * Heat action plans
  * Coastal defence
  * Agriculture resilience
  * Water management
  * Urban climate-proofing

### **Policies Supporting Climate Finance**

* National Clean Energy Mission
* Green Hydrogen Mission

* Sovereign Green Bonds (launched in 2023)

---

## **4. Mains Relevance**

### **Issues and Challenges**

#### **1. Limited Access to Global Climate Finance**

* GCF procedures are cumbersome.
* Smaller or developing country institutions lack technical expertise to draft bankable proposals.
* Disbursals are slow (only 25% of GCF money reached projects).

#### **2. Fragmented Domestic Climate Finance Landscape**

* Multiple ministries (power, environment, agriculture, MSME, housing) work independently.
* States develop projects but struggle to meet GCF documentation standards.
* Lack of unified data and coordination leads to missed opportunities.

#### **3. Adaptation Finance Gap**

* Global finance continues to favour:

  * Mitigation → 70%
  * Adaptation → 30%
* For countries like India that are **highly climate-vulnerable**, this imbalance is harmful.

#### **4. Weak Framework for Measuring Adaptation**

* Difficulty in defining indicators (10,000 → 100 shows complexity).
* Without metrics, adaptation progress is slow and unaccountable.

#### **5. Negotiation Challenges**

* Developed countries reluctant to commit to Article 9.1 obligations.
* Absence of predictable and adequate finance jeopardises developing country action.

---

### **Impacts**

#### **For India**

* Better access to concessional climate finance
* Strengthened climate resilience
* Expanded renewable and adaptation infrastructure

#### **For Global Climate Governance**

* More structured role for developing countries in shaping climate finance flows

# What are Digital Personal Data Protection Rules?
## **Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Rules, 2025: What They Do and Why the RTI Amendment Is Controversial**

---

## **1. Basic Understanding**

### **What is the DPDP Act, 2023?**

India’s **Digital Personal Data Protection Act** lays down the basic rules for how private companies and government bodies must collect, store, use, and protect the personal data of individuals (“data principals”).

It is India’s version of global data protection laws such as:

* **EU’s GDPR**
* **Singapore’s PDPA**
* **Brazil’s LGPD**

### **Core Concepts**

* **Data Fiduciary:** Any entity (company, govt department) that collects and processes personal data.
* **Data Principal:** The individual whose data is being collected.
* **Consent Manager:** A tool that helps users manage permissions and consent across multiple platforms.

---

## **2. The News**

The **Digital Personal Data Protection Rules, 2025** were notified this week.
They operationalise the DPDP Act and set up the **Data Protection Board of India (DPBI)**.

### **Why the Rules Matter**

* The Act was passed in 2023, but most provisions were not yet enforceable.
* The 2025 Rules now define:

  * Compliance timelines for companies
  * Duties of data fiduciaries
  * User rights
  * Reporting of data breaches
  * Consent mechanisms
  * Exemptions
* Crucially, they **activate the amendment to the RTI Act**, which has triggered major controversy.

---

## **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

### **A. Safeguards and Requirements Under the Act**

#### **1. Informed Consent**

Firms must:

* Inform users what data is collected
* Explain how data will be used
* Get explicit consent
* Provide a summary in clear language

#### **2. User Rights (Data Principals)**

Users can:

* Modify or correct their data
* Delete data they’ve shared
* Demand deletion after inactivity
* Withdraw consent
* Use a **Consent Manager** to control permissions across platforms

#### **3. Obligations for Data Fiduciaries**

* Encryption and access control
* Data minimisation
* Deletion of non-essential data
* Mandatory breach reporting

#### **4. Significant Data Fiduciaries (large companies)**

Must additionally:

* Appoint a **Data Protection Officer (DPO)**
* Conduct annual security audits
* Conduct data protection impact assessments

#### **5. Special Protections for Children**

* Restrictions on targeted advertising
* Limits on behavioural tracking
* Exception: parents can track minor children’s location

#### **6. Penalties**

₹10,000 to **₹250 crore** depending on:

* Data breach
* Non-compliance
* Consent violations
* Child-data infractions

### **B. Compliance Timeline**

* Most requirements **not yet in force**
* Companies get **up to 18 months** to comply
* DPO appointment starts **one year from now**
* DPBI formation: **immediate**

### **C. Data Protection Board of India (DPBI)**

* New adjudicatory body under **MeitY**, not independent
* Four members
* Handles:

  * Breach complaints
  * Penalties
  * Enforcement orders

---

## **4. Mains Relevance**

### **Issues and Challenges**

#### **1. Delay in Implementation**

* More than two years since the Act passed
* Now 12–18 more months for compliance
* Critics say this weakens user protection and benefits Big Tech

#### **2. DPBI Lacks Independence**

* Placed under MeitY
* Potential conflict of interest:

  * MeitY promotes major tech companies
  * And also supervises investigations into their data misuse

#### **3. RTI Amendment — The Most Controversial Issue**

The 2023 DPDP Act amended **Section 8(1)(j)** of the RTI Act.

**Old Rule:**
Personal information *could be disclosed* if the public interest outweighed the harm.

**New Rule:**
The public-interest exception is gone.
Government can now deny almost any request involving “personal information”.

This risks:

* Shielding officials from scrutiny
* Blocking access to muster rolls, beneficiary lists, attendance sheets
* Hindering anti-corruption social audits
* Weakening accountability in welfare schemes
* Obstructing journalists and activists
* Diluting one of India’s strongest transparency laws

Civil society groups (MKSS, NCPRI) argue:

* This amendment **erodes the Right to Information**
* It undermines democratic oversight
* It was introduced despite widespread opposition

#### **4. Broader Definition of Personal Information**

Authorities can treat almost anything as “personal”, including:

* Employee attendance
* Beneficiary records
* Inspection reports
* Duty rosters

This affects:

* MGNREGA audits
* PDS leak detection
* Local corruption investigations

#### **5. Grassroots Accountability Impacted**

MKSS cites examples:

* Musters and logbooks expose ghost workers, fake bills, and embezzlement
* If these are denied as “personal information”, corruption becomes easier to hide

#### **6. No Public Consultation on the RTI Amendment**

* The government invoked its power to notify the amendment immediately
* Done despite years of pushback

---

## **5. Way Forward**

### **1. Restore Public-Interest Exception in RTI**

* Reinstate the earlier safeguard that allowed disclosure when public interest outweighs privacy concerns.

### **2. Strengthen DPBI’s Independence**

* Convert to a statutory, autonomous body
* Appointment through a multi-stakeholder selection panel
* Transparent reporting

### **3. Limit Scope of “Personal Information”**

* Clear definitions
* Protective for individuals, but not shielding public servants from accountability

### **4. Shorter and Phased Compliance Deadlines**

* Cut implementation timelines to 6–12 months
* Allow staggered rollout by sector but not prolonged delay

### **5. Enhance Citizen Awareness**

* Provide clear guidance on:

  * Data rights
  * Consent controls
  * Mechanisms for breach reporting

### **6. Balance Privacy and Transparency**

* Privacy should protect the individual, not the state
* Transparency should be preserved in:

  * Welfare processes
  * Public appointments
  * Public finance processes
  * Government contracts

### **7. Technical Capacity Building**

* Support small firms and government departments to meet compliance
* Develop standardized templates and toolkits

### **8. Regular Audits and Accountability**

* Independent privacy audits
* Public annual reports by DPBI
* Stronger whistleblower protection for data breaches
