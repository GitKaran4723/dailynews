# Are social media platforms dying a slow death?
---

## **Enshittification: How the Internet Is Getting Worse for Its Users**

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Meaning of Enshittification:**
  Coined by **Cory Doctorow** in 2022, *enshittification* refers to the **systematic decline in user experience on digital platforms** as companies prioritize profits over users.
  It describes a predictable cycle:

  1. Platforms are **good to users** to attract them.
  2. Then they **exploit users** to benefit advertisers and business partners.
  3. Finally, they **exploit advertisers** to maximize profit — until the platform collapses.

* **Core Idea:**
  Enshittification is **not accidental**. It’s an **outcome of monopolistic behavior**, profit maximization, and lack of regulation that enables tech companies to manipulate digital ecosystems.

* **Symptoms of Enshittification:**

  * Intrusive and unskippable ads.
  * Paid features replacing free ones.
  * Search and recommendation algorithms favoring corporate profits.
  * Decline in content quality and authenticity.
  * Difficulty in leaving or cancelling services (“walled garden” ecosystems).

* **Why It Matters:**
  Enshittification represents the **erosion of user rights, trust, and transparency** in the digital economy — transforming once-democratic internet spaces into profit-driven closed systems.

---

### 2. **The News**

* **Recent Context:**
  Across digital platforms — social media, search engines, streaming services, and e-commerce — users have observed a steady **decline in quality and openness**.
  What were once innovative, user-centric platforms are now heavily monetized, restrictive, and ad-saturated.

* **Key Examples:**

  * **YouTube:** Multiple unskippable ads and crackdown on ad-blockers, pushing users toward **YouTube Premium**.
  * **Twitter/X:** Paid verification replaced credibility with monetization, leading to **scam accounts and misinformation**.
  * **Instagram:** Focus shifted from friends’ photos to **algorithm-driven Reels and ads**, diminishing organic engagement.
  * **Google:** **AI-generated summaries** now crowd out original news and reliable sources; self-preferencing increases.
  * **Spotify & Netflix:** Restrict free users and introduce **tiered pricing with ads**, effectively degrading the base experience.
  * **Amazon:** Prioritizes **sponsored listings and its own products**; makes Prime cancellation intentionally difficult.

* **Doctorow’s Analysis:**
  He attributes this degradation to weakened checks on corporate power — specifically:

  1. **Reduced competition** (monopoly control).
  2. **Weak regulation** (limited antitrust enforcement).
  3. **User disempowerment** (lack of transparency or control).
  4. **Worker disempowerment** (no unionization or ethical dissent within tech).
