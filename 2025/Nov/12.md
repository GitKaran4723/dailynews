# ISRO conducts crucial safety tests on main parachutes for Gaganyaan crew
### **1. Basic Understanding**

* **Gaganyaan Mission:**
  India’s first human spaceflight program, initiated by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), aims to send a three-member crew into a 400 km orbit for a 3-day mission and return them safely to Earth.

* **Crew Module (CM):**
  This is the spacecraft that will carry astronauts. It must safely re-enter Earth’s atmosphere and land using a **parachute-based deceleration and recovery system**.

* **Parachute System Function:**
  The Crew Module slows down from hypersonic re-entry speeds to a soft touchdown in the sea.
  It uses a **sequence of parachutes** to ensure controlled deceleration and stability during descent.

* **Reefed Inflation:**
  A technique used to reduce the shock load when a parachute opens. The parachute first inflates partially (reefed) and then fully (disreefed) after a delay using **pyrotechnic devices (pyro devices)**.

# Why do astronauts wear pressurised suits?
## **Human Survival in Space: The Role of Pressure and Spacesuits**

---

### **1. Basic Understanding**

#### **What is Space?**

* **Definition:** Space is the vast, airless expanse beyond Earth’s atmosphere, extending into an environment dominated by **vacuum**, **microgravity**, and **extreme temperatures**.
* **Key Feature:** The **absence of atmospheric pressure** distinguishes space from Earth’s environment.

#### **Atmospheric Pressure and Its Importance**

* The **Earth’s atmosphere** — a blanket of gases (mostly nitrogen and oxygen) — is held by gravity.
* It **exerts a pressure of about 1 atmosphere (atm)** or **101.3 kPa** at sea level, equivalent to **20 tonnes of force** on the human body.
* Humans do not feel this because **internal body pressure balances** external atmospheric pressure.
* As altitude increases, air pressure drops — at extreme altitudes or in space, pressure becomes **nearly zero (vacuum)**.

#### **Why Pressure Matters for Life:**

* Maintains **bodily fluids in liquid state**.
* Enables **oxygen exchange** in the lungs.
* Keeps **gas volumes in tissues stable**.

When exposed to vacuum, the human body cannot survive due to:

* **Ebullism:** Bodily fluids boil at low pressure.
* **Hypoxia:** Lack of oxygen leads to unconsciousness in ~15 seconds.
* **Decompression:** Gases expand in lungs, rupturing tissues.
* **Ultimate fatality** within a few minutes.
