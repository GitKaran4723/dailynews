# Remove stray dogs from public places, orders SC
## Supreme Court Directions on Stray Dog Menace

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Stray Dog Issue in India:**
  India has one of the world’s largest stray dog populations — estimated at over 6 crore. Rapid urbanisation, unplanned waste management, and lack of effective animal control policies have worsened the problem. Dog bites and rabies cases have become major public health concerns.
* **Legal Background:**

  * The **Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960** governs the protection and treatment of animals.
  * The **Animal Birth Control (ABC) Rules, 2023** mandate sterilisation and vaccination of stray dogs as a humane means to control their population.
  * Local bodies are primarily responsible for implementation.
* **Public Health Concern:**
  Dog bites cause injuries, psychological trauma, and spread of **rabies**, which kills around 20,000 people annually in India (as per WHO).

### 2. **The News**

* On **Friday**, a **Supreme Court Bench comprising Justices Vikram Nath, Sandeep Mehta, and N.V. Anjaria** expressed serious concern over the **“disturbing increase” in dog-bite incidents** across the country.
* The Court directed all **States and Union Territories** to **immediately remove stray dogs** from sensitive public areas like **schools, hospitals, sports complexes, bus stands, depots, and railway stations**.
* These dogs must be **relocated to designated shelters** after being **sterilised and vaccinated** as per **ABC Rules, 2023**.
* Importantly, the Court ordered that **stray dogs once removed shall not be released back into the same locality**, to prevent reoccupation of sensitive zones.
* **Implementation Responsibility:** Municipal bodies must carry out this directive and submit **compliance reports within 8 weeks**.
* The Court also extended concern to **cattle and stray animals on highways**, directing **NHAI and transport authorities** to ensure their removal to prevent road accidents.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Animal Birth Control (ABC) Rules, 2023:**

  * Humane method of controlling stray dog population through sterilisation and vaccination.
  * Managed jointly by local authorities and animal welfare organisations.
* **National Rabies Control Programme (NRCP):**

  * Aims to eliminate dog-mediated rabies by 2030 (“Zero by 30” target).
  * Focuses on vaccination drives and public awareness.
* **Municipal Solid Waste Management Rules (2016):**

  * Indirectly relevant, as improper waste disposal sustains stray populations.
* **State-level Initiatives:**

  * Kerala, Maharashtra, and Delhi have adopted sterilisation and dog shelter models (though implementation gaps remain).

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### (a) **Issues and Challenges**

* **Urban Governance Failure:** Poor implementation of ABC Rules; weak municipal capacity.
* **Public Health vs. Animal Rights Conflict:** Striking a balance between safety and compassion is challenging.
* **Judicial-Administrative Coordination:** Directions often remain unimplemented due to lack of monitoring.
* **Funding Constraints:** Municipal bodies often lack dedicated funds for animal shelters and vaccination drives.

#### (b) **Impacts**

* **Society:** Rise in fear, hostility, and occasional mob actions against stray dogs.
* **Health:** Increased cases of rabies and injuries; burden on public healthcare.
* **Governance:** Reflects inefficiency in urban local body functioning and inter-agency coordination.
* **Environment:** Improper animal disposal or relocation can disturb urban ecology and wildlife balance.

#### (c) **Ethical and Governance Concerns**

* Balancing **animal welfare** (protected under Article 51A(g) – Fundamental Duty to show compassion to living creatures) with **citizen safety**.
* Ensuring humane treatment and avoiding mass culling or cruelty.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Strengthen Local Implementation:**

   * Empower municipalities with funds, veterinary staff, and monitoring systems.
   * Use technology (geo-tagging of sterilised dogs, digital compliance tracking).

2. **Establish Modern Shelters:**

   * Create well-equipped “Animal Care Centres” in each district.
   * Encourage PPP models with NGOs and veterinary colleges.

3. **Public Participation:**

   * Awareness drives on dog behaviour, vaccination, and reporting mechanisms.
   * Promote community responsibility rather than hostility.

4. **Scientific Waste Management:**

   * Reduce open garbage access that sustains stray populations.

5. **Integrated National Framework:**

   * A unified **National Stray Animal Control Authority** to coordinate between Centre, States, and ULBs for accountability and uniform implementation.

# A wider SIR has momentum but it is still a test case
## Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of Electoral Rolls – 2025

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **What is an Electoral Roll?**
  The **electoral roll** is an official list of all citizens eligible to vote in elections. It includes details such as name, age, gender, and address, and forms the foundation of free and fair elections.

* **Why Revision is Needed:**
  Regular updates ensure that:

  * Deceased, duplicate, or migrated voters are deleted.
  * New eligible voters (18+) are added.
  * Corrections in names and addresses are made.

* **What is a Special Intensive Revision (SIR)?**
  The **SIR** is a large-scale, field-based revision of electoral rolls ordered by the **Election Commission of India (ECI)**.
  Unlike annual *summary revisions*, SIR involves **door-to-door enumeration** and verification by **Booth Level Officers (BLOs)**.

  * The **last SIR** was conducted **21 years ago** (in 2004).
  * The **current SIR (2025–26)** is the **ninth** in India’s electoral history.

* **Constitutional Basis:**

  * **Article 324:** Empowers the ECI to supervise and control elections.
  * **Article 326:** Defines the right to vote as based on adult suffrage (citizens aged 18+, not disqualified by law).
  * **Representation of the People Acts (1950 & 1951):** Provide the legal framework for preparation and revision of electoral rolls.

---

### 2. **The News**

* The **Election Commission of India (ECI)** launched a **Special Intensive Revision (SIR)** of electoral rolls on **November 4, 2025**, across **nine States and three Union Territories**:

  * **States:** Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Kerala, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat
  * **Union Territories:** Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep, Puducherry

* The **draft roll** will be published on **December 9, 2025**, and the **final roll** on **February 7, 2026** — ahead of several State elections in 2026.

* This follows the successful SIR exercise in **Bihar**, which was seen as a pilot project amid ongoing State elections.

* **Scale of Operation:**

  * Covers **51 crore electors** (over half of India’s electorate).
  * Spans **321 districts**, **1,843 Assembly constituencies**, and **5.33 lakh polling stations**.
  * Involves equal number of **BLOs** and **7.64 lakh booth-level agents** of political parties.

* **Procedural Highlights:**

  * No document collection during enumeration phase (reduces voter anxiety).
  * Verification through **three home visits** by BLOs.
  * Use of **Form 6** (new voter), **Form 7** (deletion), **Form 8** (correction).
  * Strict prohibition on transfer of officials involved in SIR work.

* **Purpose:**
  To clean up the voter list, remove ineligible names, and ensure inclusion of genuine electors — especially ahead of upcoming State elections.

---

### 3. **Government & Institutional Mechanisms**

* **Election Commission of India (ECI):**

  * Constitutional authority under **Article 324**; supervises all electoral processes.
  * Coordinates with Chief Electoral Officers and State machinery.
* **Booth Level Officers (BLOs):**

  * Act as the interface between the voter and the ECI.
  * Conduct door-to-door enumeration and verification.
* **State Governments:**

  * Required to provide manpower for enumeration.
  * Prohibited from transferring officials engaged in the SIR.
* **Judicial Oversight:**

  * The **Supreme Court of India** has validated the **legitimacy** of the SIR process.
  * Emphasised that while cleaning rolls, the **right to vote of genuine citizens** must not be denied.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### (a) **Issues and Challenges**

* **Political Opposition:**

  * States like **Tamil Nadu**, **Kerala**, and **West Bengal** have expressed reservations, fearing exclusion of eligible voters or misuse for political ends.
* **Administrative Hurdles:**

  * Managing a workforce of lakhs across diverse geographies.
  * Ensuring uniform standards while accommodating local differences.
* **Citizenship and Migration Issues:**

  * Border States (especially West Bengal and Assam) face challenges of infiltration and citizenship disputes.
* **Public Trust Deficit:**

  * Fear of disenfranchisement or data misuse among citizens.
* **Coordination Burden:**

  * Between State governments, ECI, political parties, and civil society.

#### (b) **Significance**

* **Democratic Integrity:**
  A clean and updated electoral roll is the cornerstone of free and fair elections.
* **Public Trust:**
  Transparency in verification enhances citizens’ confidence in the electoral system.
* **Administrative Modernisation:**
  SIR complements the ECI’s ongoing efforts like **voter helplines, online registration (NVSP)**, and **digital voter ID cards (e-EPIC)**.

#### (c) **Ethical & Governance Perspective**

* Upholds the **right to vote** (Article 326) as a democratic right.
* Demonstrates **institutional independence** and resilience of the ECI despite political pressures.
* Balances **accuracy and inclusion**, avoiding both duplication and disenfranchisement.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Strengthen Transparency and Communication:**

   * Frequent public updates and local-language awareness campaigns.
   * Involve political parties and civil society as *watchdogs* in the process.

2. **Technological Integration:**

   * Use of **AI-based duplication detection**, **biometric cross-verification**, and **geo-tagging of BLO visits** for accuracy.

3. **Uniform Standards with Local Adaptability:**

   * Standardised ECI guidelines but flexible timelines and methods for regions with unique challenges (like tribal or border areas).

4. **Inclusive Processes:**

   * Facilitate enrolment of marginalised groups — migrant workers, homeless persons, and women.
   * Ensure BLOs carry adequate blank forms (as mandated) for on-the-spot enrolment.

5. **Capacity Building:**

   * Continuous training for BLOs and supervisors.
   * Incentivise quality and timely completion of enumeration tasks.

6. **Build Political Consensus:**

   * Encourage cooperative federalism; States and parties should treat SIR as an administrative, not political, exercise.

7. **Long-term Vision:**

   * Move toward a **National Voter Database** linked (securely) with Aadhaar, ensuring a single, accurate, and mobile voter identity.

---

**In essence**, the SIR-2025 represents a critical test for the **Election Commission’s institutional capacity** and **India’s democratic credibility**.
If executed efficiently, it can strengthen the integrity of the electoral process and enhance public faith — a cornerstone of constitutional democracy.
