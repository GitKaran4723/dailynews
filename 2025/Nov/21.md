# Judiciary cannot tie President, Governor to timelines, says SC
## **Supreme Court’s Opinion on the 16th Presidential Reference: Governor’s Powers on State Bills**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

**What is a Presidential Reference?**

* Under **Article 143**, the President may refer questions of law or fact of public importance to the Supreme Court for advisory opinion.
* The Court’s opinion is **not binding**, but carries high persuasive value.

**Governor’s Role in State Bills (Article 200)**
When a Bill is passed by a State Legislature, the Governor may:

1. Give assent
2. Withhold assent
3. Reserve the Bill for the President
4. Return the Bill for reconsideration (if not a Money Bill)

**President’s Role (Article 201)**
When a Bill is reserved for the President:

1. President may give assent
2. Withhold assent (effectively veto)
3. Direct the Governor to return the Bill to the Legislature (if not a Money Bill)

**Context Behind This Reference**

* Several States alleged that Governors were **deliberately delaying assent**, creating governance paralysis.
* Some High Courts set deadlines, implying **“deemed assent”** if Governors failed to act.
* The President sought clarity through a reference under Article 143.

---

### **2. The News**

* A **five-judge Bench** of the Supreme Court delivered its opinion on the **16th Presidential Reference**.

* The Court held that:

  * Courts **cannot impose uniform timelines** (“one-size-fits-all”) on Governors and the President to decide on State Bills.
  * Courts **cannot assume deemed assent** if Governors fail to act within a court-fixed time.
  * Such intervention would violate the **doctrine of separation of powers**.

* However, the Court also issued a stern warning:

  * Governors and the President **cannot engage in “prolonged and evasive inaction”** by indefinitely sitting on Bills.

* The Bench consisted of **CJI B.R. Gavai, Chief Justice-designate Surya Kant, Justices Vikram Nath, P.S. Narasimha, and A.S. Chandurkar**.

---

### **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

**Relevant Constitutional Framework**

* **Article 200**: Governor’s options on State Bills.
* **Article 201**: President’s decision on reserved Bills.
* **Article 143**: Presidential Reference for Supreme Court advisory opinion.

**Past Judicial Interventions**

* *Shamsher Singh v. State of Punjab (1974)*: Governor should act on the advice of the Council of Ministers.
* *Nabam Rebia case (2016)*: Governor cannot act without or against ministerial advice, except in specific constitutional situations.

**Union Government’s Stand**

* Emphasises that Governors must follow constitutional limits but also safeguard national interests in sensitive Bills.

**State Government Demands**

* States like Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and Punjab have repeatedly flagged delays by Governors.
* Several Bills have been pending for months or years, prompting litigations.

---

#### **A. Issues and Challenges**

1. **Federal Tensions**

   * Delays by Governors can disrupt legislative functioning and weaken cooperative federalism.

2. **Ambiguity in Constitutional Timelines**

   * The Constitution prescribes **no fixed timeline**, leading to potential misuse.

3. **Judicial Limitations**

   * While courts cannot fix uniform deadlines or create “deemed assent,” they must still uphold constitutional accountability.

4. **Separation of Powers Concerns**

   * Courts stepping into Executive discretion is seen as overreach.
   * Governors overstretching their discretion is an executive overreach affecting State autonomy.

5. **Political Misuse of Gubernatorial Office**

   * Increasingly, Governors are accused of acting as agents of the Centre rather than independent constitutional heads.

#### **B. Impact on Governance**

* **Positive clarity**: The decision defines boundaries of judicial and executive roles.
* **However, ambiguity remains** on how to prevent indefinite delays.
* **Legislative paralysis** may continue unless norms are followed in good faith.

#### **C. Polity & Constitutional Significance**

* Reinforces the **basic structure** doctrine.
* Strengthens understanding of the **federal balance** and constitutional morality.

---

### **5. Way Forward**

1. **Define Reasonable Timelines**

   * While courts cannot impose fixed periods, the Union Government and States may evolve a **constitutional convention**—for instance, acting within 3–6 months.

2. **Codify Processes Through Rules of Business**

   * States can frame clearer procedures requiring the Governor’s Secretariat to record reasons and progress.

3. **Strengthen Cooperative Federalism**

   * Institutional engagement between Centre, Governors, and States to avoid politically driven delays.

4. **Ensure Transparency & Accountability**

   * Publish annual reports on pending Bills.

# Is air pollution a South Asian crisis?
## **Delhi’s Air Pollution in a Regional Context: The South Asian Airshed Crisis**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

**What is AQI?**

* The **Air Quality Index (AQI)** measures air pollution levels based on major pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, and O₃.
* AQI above **300** indicates **hazardous air**, affecting even healthy individuals.

**Delhi’s Pollution Cycle**

* Every winter, Delhi experiences a severe spike in pollution due to a mix of:

  * Meteorological factors: low wind speed, temperature inversion, stagnant air
  * Anthropogenic sources: vehicles, industry, construction dust, waste burning
  * Transboundary contributions: stubble burning in Punjab–Haryana, emissions from Pakistan, dust from the Indo-Gangetic Plain

**Airshed Concept**

* An **airshed** is a region where air pollutants share the same atmospheric circulation system.
* Pollutants released in one part of the airshed can easily travel across **borders and states**.
* The Indo-Gangetic Plain is one of the **most polluted airsheds** in the world.

# Why are stone quarries expanding in Kerala?
## **Ban on River Sand Mining in Kerala and the Rise of Stone Quarries**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

**Why is sand important?**

* Sand is a critical resource for construction—especially **river sand**, valued for its quality.
* But **excessive river sand mining** causes:

  * Riverbank erosion
  * Loss of aquatic biodiversity
  * Lowering of water tables
  * Impacts on fish migration
  * Habitat destruction

**M-sand (Manufactured Sand)**

* Produced by crushing hard rocks like granite.
* Promoted as an eco-friendly alternative to river sand.
* However, large-scale quarrying for M-sand can cause **land degradation, habitat loss, and biodiversity threats**.

**Protected Areas (PAs)**

* Ecologically sensitive zones such as Wildlife Sanctuaries, National Parks, and buffer zones.
* Mining near PAs threatens ecosystems, wildlife corridors, hydrology, and soil stability.

---

### **2. The News**

* Kerala banned **river sand mining in January 2016** to protect rivers from ecological degradation.
* After the ban, **M-sand demand surged**, leading to an **explosion in stone quarrying**.
* Scientists from **NIT Calicut** analysed 72 quarries within **10 km of Protected Areas (PAs)** using GIS and Google Earth Pro.
* Their findings published in *The Extractive Industries and Society* show:

  * **174% expansion** in quarry area in 2016 alone (compared to pre-ban years).
  * Some quarries **doubled or tripled** in size.
* Three quarries near **Malabar Wildlife Sanctuary (Kozhikode–Wayanad)** grew **232% in 2016**.
* Three more quarries within the **buffer zone of Silent Valley National Park** also doubled in size.
* Researchers warn that such quarrying **threatens biodiversity** and may have broader socioecological impacts.

---

### **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

#### **A. Kerala-Specific Measures**

* **2016 ban** on river sand mining (except regulated desilting).
* **Promotion of M-sand** as an alternative (quality standards, licensing).
* **Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)** and clearances for quarrying.
* **Monitoring by Kerala State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB)**.
* **District-level sand monitoring committees**.

#### **B. National Framework**

* **Environment Protection Act, 1986** governs mining and land use.
* **Sustainable Sand Mining Guidelines (SSMG), 2016**.
* **Enforcement & Monitoring Guidelines for Sand Mining (2020)**—EMGSM.
* Use of **remote sensing**, drones, and GPS tracking for mining surveillance.
* **Wildlife Protection Act**, **Forest Conservation Act** regulate activity near protected areas.

#### **C. Biodiversity and Ecosystem Protection**

* **Ecologically Sensitive Zones (ESZs)** around national parks.
* **National Wildlife Action Plan (2017–31)** prioritises habitat integrity.
* **Compensatory Afforestation** and **Mine Closure Plans** under mining laws.

---

### **4. Mains Relevance**

#### **A. Issues and Challenges**

1. **Unintended Consequences of the Mining Ban**

   * Ban on river sand → M-sand boom → quarry expansion and land degradation.
   * Shows the importance of **integrated resource planning**, not isolated bans.

2. **Threats to Biodiversity**

   * Quarries near Malabar Wildlife Sanctuary & Silent Valley buffer zones alter:

     * Wildlife movement
     * Soil stability
     * Water flow patterns
     * Forest cover
     * Noise and dust pollution

3. **Socio-Ecological Trade-offs**

   * As noted by researchers, increased quarrying affects:

     * Ecosystem services
     * Livelihoods
     * Coastal fishing communities (“blue injustices”)
   * Mining disrupts sediment transport → affects fish migration routes (e.g., Chavara village).

4. **River Morphology Changes**

   * Studies (e.g., Mayurakshi river) show accelerated sand mining (2010–20) alters:

     * Channel depth
     * Flow pattern
     * Riverbank stability
   * Kerala may face similar long-term impacts.

5. **Rising Construction Demand**

   * Rapid urbanisation has intensified demand for sand and M-sand.
   * Mining regulation has not kept pace with the boom in infrastructure.

6. **Governance Gaps**

   * Weak enforcement, illegal quarrying, poor monitoring.
   * Quarry clusters near protected areas indicate loopholes in zoning and EIAs.

#### **B. Broader Developmental Context**

* Air pollution, sand mining, and urban expansion reflect **unsustainable development patterns**.
* They highlight:

  * Loss of ecological integrity
  * Economic costs borne by vulnerable communities
  * Failure to internalise environmental costs in construction and infrastructure sectors
  * Lack of long-term thinking in resource planning

---

### **5. Way Forward**

1. **Integrated Sand Resource Governance**

   * Develop a **State Sand Budget** to match demand and sustainable supply.
   * Strictly regulate siting of quarries—no mining near PAs or ESZs.

2. **Strengthen Monitoring Mechanisms**

   * Use remote sensing, GPS tracking, satellite imagery, AI-based monitoring.
   * Quarterly audits and surprise inspections.

3. **Promote Sustainable Alternatives**

   * Encourage:

     * Recycled construction and demolition (C&D) waste
     * Manufactured sand from low-impact geological formations
     * Alternative materials (geo-polymers, fly ash bricks)

4. **Re-evaluate M-sand Policy**

   * Quality certification, environmental limits on quarry expansion.
   * Cap total annual extraction volumes.

5. **Protect Biodiversity Hotspots**

   * Declare no-mining zones within at least **10–15 km** of PAs.
   * Demarcate ecological corridors and buffer zones.

6. **Community Engagement**

   * Involve local communities in monitoring and reporting illegal quarrying.
   * Ensure livelihood alternatives and compensations.

7. **Long-term Strategic Planning**

   * Urban planning that reduces sand demand through:

     * Green construction norms
     * Low-material infrastructure designs
     * Incentives for eco-friendly building materials

8. **Strengthen Inter-State Coordination**

   * Since sand movement is inter-state, harmonised policies across South Indian states are essential.

9. **Scientific Restoration Plans**

   * Rehabilitate degraded quarry sites through afforestation and landscape restoration.
