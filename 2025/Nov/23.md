# Are e-KYC norms excluding MGNREGA workers?
## **MNREGA e-KYC Drive & the Spike in Worker Deletions: Causes, Concerns & Implications**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

#### **What is MNREGA?**

* The **Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA)** provides:

  * 100 days of wage employment
  * For every rural household that seeks unskilled work
* Coverage: **26 crore workers** across **2.69 lakh gram panchayats**.

#### **Job Cards**

* A job card is the identity + work record for each MNREGA worker.
* Deletion of job cards can mean:

  * Workers have migrated
  * Workers are no longer seeking work
  * Verification failures
  * Systemic or technical exclusions

#### **e-KYC**

* **Know Your Customer (e-KYC)** under MNREGA matches:

  * A live photograph of the worker (via NMMS app)
  * With their Aadhaar database photograph

Purpose:

* Increase transparency
* Prevent ghost workers
* Ensure accurate identity verification

---

### **2. The News**

* Between **October 10 and November 14, 2025**, MNREGA saw **27 lakh deletions** — almost double the deletions of the previous six months.
* Only **10.5 lakh workers** were added in the same period.
* This spike aligns with the Union Government’s push to complete **e-KYC verification**.

#### **Government’s Position**

* Verification is a **continuous process**.
* e-KYC is meant to:

  * Improve transparency
  * Reduce fraud
  * Enhance service delivery
* **56%** of active workers have completed e-KYC.

   * Required:

     * Aadhaar-job card match
     * Aadhaar-bank account seeding
     * NPCI mapping
     * Bank IIN mapping
   * Led to large-scale exclusions due to spelling errors, faulty seeding, mismatched demographic details.

#### **b. How e-KYC Works**

* On the NMMS app:

  * A live photo of the worker is captured.
  * Matched with Aadhaar photo.
* This aims to eliminate impersonation but can exclude workers whose Aadhaar may be outdated or unclear.

#### **c. New Verification SOP**

* Standard Operating Procedure (Jan 2025) includes:

  * Publishing names of workers proposed for deletion.
  * Providing time to appeal.
  * Multi-level verification:

    * Gram panchayat: 100% verification
    * Block: 20%
