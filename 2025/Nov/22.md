# Centre notifies four new Labour Codes
## **Labour Codes Notified by the Centre**

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

India’s labour laws were historically fragmented, with **29 different laws** dealing with wages, social security, industrial disputes, and workplace safety. Many of these laws were outdated (1930s–1950s), overlapping, and complicated for both workers and employers.

To simplify and modernise labour regulation, the government consolidated them into **four Labour Codes**:

1. **Code on Wages, 2019** – Deals with minimum wages, payment of wages, bonus, and pay parity.
2. **Industrial Relations (IR) Code, 2020** – Covers trade unions, disputes, layoffs, strikes, and industrial harmony.
3. **Code on Social Security (SS), 2020** – Expands social security to gig workers, platform workers, unorganised sector workers.
4. **Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions (OSHWC) Code, 2020** – Ensures safety, health standards, working hours, and facilities.

**Goal:** Simplify laws, promote ease of doing business, improve worker protection, and boost employment generation.

---

### 2. **The News**

* On **Friday**, the **Central government formally notified and operationalised all four Labour Codes**.
* These Codes bring major reforms:

  * **Universal social security for gig and platform workers**
  * **Statutory minimum wages across the country**
  * **Gender pay parity**
  * **Fixed-term employment**
  * **Expanded safety norms for women workers**
* However, **10 Central Trade Unions** issued a joint statement criticising the reforms as **“anti-worker and pro-employer”**, arguing that the Codes dilute labour protections.
* The Codes replace **29 earlier labour laws**, marking a major structural overhaul.
* PM Modi called the reforms **“one of the most comprehensive and progressive labour reforms since Independence.”**

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

**a) Code on Wages, 2019**

* Introduces a **universal minimum wage** concept.
* Ensures **gender parity in wages**.
* Simplifies wage definitions for PF, bonus, and gratuity.

**b) Industrial Relations Code, 2020**

* Establishes **Industrial Tribunals** with quicker dispute resolution.
* Raises the threshold for prior government permission for layoffs (from 100 to 300 workers).
* Introduces **fixed-term employment** with benefits equal to permanent workers.

**c) Code on Social Security, 2020**

* Extends social security to:

  * **Gig workers**
  * **Platform workers**
  * **Unorganised sector workers**
* Creates a **Social Security Fund** financed partly by aggregators.

**d) OSHWC Code, 2020**

* Sets uniform workplace safety norms.
* Regulates working hours, night shifts, and creche facilities.
* Allows **women to work at night** with safety measures.

**e) Broader Government Initiatives Related to Labour Reform**

* **Shram Suvidha Portal** for compliance.
* **e-Shram Portal** for registration of unorganised workers.
* **National Career Service (NCS)** for employment facilitation.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

**a) Issues & Challenges**

* **Trade union opposition:** Unions argue that the Codes weaken bargaining power, facilitate easier layoffs, and centralise authority.
* **Implementation challenges:** Labour is a concurrent subject; States need to prepare rules, which delays enforcement.
* **Gig worker concerns:** Lack of clear funding mechanism for social security; ambiguity on contributions by aggregators.
* **Threshold expansion:** Increasing layoff-permission limits may reduce job security for factory workers.
* **Fixed-term employment risks:** Potential rise in contractualization.

**b) Impact Analysis**

**Society:**

* Potentially better coverage for informal workers.
* Women workers benefit through safety and parity measures.

**Economy:**

* Simplified labour compliance may improve investment climate.
* Greater flexibility could boost manufacturing and job creation.

**Polity & Governance:**

* Balancing economic reforms with worker welfare becomes a key governance challenge.
* State–Centre coordination becomes crucial for uniform implementation.

**Ethical Dimensions:**

* Ensuring worker dignity vs. industrial efficiency.
* Protecting vulnerable workers (gig/platform) in a rapidly changing digital economy.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Strengthen Tripartite Consultation**

   * Regular engagement between government, employers, and trade unions to build trust.

2. **Clear Guidelines for Gig Worker Social Security**

   * Define aggregator contributions, portability of benefits, and grievance redressal systems.

3. **Capacity Building of Labour Departments**

   * Improve inspection systems, use digital tools, and ensure transparency.

4. **Balancing Flexibility and Protection**

   * While flexibility helps industries, stronger safeguards should be designed for informal and contract workers.

5. **State-Level Harmonisation**

   * Encourage States to adopt uniform rules, avoiding policy fragmentation.

6. **Awareness and Worker Education**

   * Inform workers about rights, minimum wage entitlements, and social security benefits.

# Blow to States
## **Supreme Court’s Opinion on the 16th Presidential Reference**

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

To understand this issue, it is important to first grasp the **constitutional provisions related to assent to State Bills**:

* **Article 200**: When a State Bill is presented to the Governor, they may:

  1. Give assent
  2. Withhold assent
  3. Return the Bill (except money bills) for reconsideration
  4. Reserve it for the President

  *The Constitution uses the phrase “**as soon as possible**” for the Governor’s decision, implying urgency but without a fixed timeline.*

* **Article 201**: If a Bill is reserved for the President, the President may give or withhold assent. No time frame is prescribed.

* **Separation of Powers**: Courts cannot encroach upon the constitutional roles assigned to the executive or legislature.

* **Federalism**: India follows “cooperative federalism,” with both Union and states having autonomy within their spheres.

In April 2025, the Supreme Court had prescribed **three-month timelines** and even applied **Article 142** (extraordinary powers) to declare **deemed assent** in Tamil Nadu’s case due to prolonged inaction by the Governor.

The **16th Presidential Reference** asked again: *Can courts fix timelines or infer “deemed assent” when Governors delay?*

---

### 2. **The News**

* The **Supreme Court**, in answering the 16th Presidential Reference, held that:

  * **Courts cannot impose fixed timelines** on Governors or the President for granting assent to State Bills.
  * **Courts cannot assume “deemed assent”**, as this would encroach upon executive authority.
  * However, **Governors cannot resort to prolonged or evasive inaction**.
  * The Court suggested a **“limited mandamus”** (direction) can be issued in cases of extreme delay—but without defining what counts as “reasonable time”.

* The Court emphasised **separation of powers**, declining to use Article 142 to remedy political or constitutional delays.

* Substantively, the judgment has raised concerns:

  * It expands Governors’ discretion without clear accountability.
  * It contradicts the April 2025 judgment that emphasised State autonomy and timelines.
  * It weakens the effect of the legislature re-passing a Bill after reconsideration.
  * It allows Governors to reserve Bills for the President even after a second passage.

* Critics argue this is a **setback for federalism**, especially in Opposition-ruled States where Governors have delayed several Bills.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

Although this issue concerns constitutional interpretation, certain government commissions and recommendations are relevant:

1. **Sarkaria Commission (1988)**

   * Recommended a **six-month time limit** for Governors to decide on Bills.
   * Stressed that the Governor must act **on the aid and advice** of the Council of Ministers except in rare cases.

2. **Punchhi Commission (2010)**

   * Advised **limiting the misuse of discretionary powers** by Governors.
   * Recommended clear guidelines for when a Bill may be reserved for the President.

3. **Justice M.M. Punchhi Committee**

   * Warned against Governors acting as agents of the Union.
   * Called for strengthening federal norms.

4. **Union Government:**

   * Has not enacted any statutory framework to clearly define timelines.
   * Often asserts that Governor’s actions must follow constitutional text but are discretionary in nature.

These show that **policy-level thinking supports timelines and clarity**, but **judicial enforcement** has now been restricted by the new ruling.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### **a) Issues and Challenges**

1. **Erosion of Federalism**

   * The ruling gives Governors wide discretion with minimal accountability.
   * States cannot enforce timelines or automatic assent.

2. **Weakening of State Legislatures**

   * Even after re-passing a Bill, the legislature’s authority is undermined.
   * The Governor can still reserve the Bill for the President.

3. **Scope for Executive Overreach**

   * Governors (often political appointees) may delay Bills in Opposition-ruled States.
   * Bills reserved for the President can remain pending indefinitely.

4. **Judicial Minimalism vs Constitutional Morality**

   * The Court emphasised strict separation of powers but ignored functional federalism.
   * It failed to enforce the constitutional phrase “as soon as possible”.

5. **Absence of Remedy for States**

   * No “deemed assent” after long delay.
   * No clear definition of “reasonable period”.
   * Limited judicial review on Articles 200 and 201 decisions.

#### **b) Impacts**

**Polity & Governance**

* Increases the Centre’s indirect influence over State legislation.
* Undermines accountability mechanisms in constitutional offices.

**Political Relations**

* Could intensify Centre–State friction.
* Legislation in Opposition-ruled States becomes vulnerable.

**Constitutional Order**

* Weakens the spirit of cooperative federalism.
* Increases the gap between constitutional text and practice.

**Ethical Dimensions**

* Raises concerns about neutrality of Governors.
* Violates the principle of democratic legitimacy and people’s mandate.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Statutory Timelines by Parliament or States (via request)**

   * Although the Court said timelines cannot be judicially imposed,
     **Parliament can legislate to fix reasonable timelines** for Governors and the President.

2. **Revisiting Constitutional Conventions**

   * Establish conventions that Governors act strictly on **aid and advice**, except in exceptional circumstances.

3. **Strengthening Accountability Mechanisms**

   * Annual reports of Governors on pending Bills.
   * Legislative review committees to examine delays.

4. **Clear Guidelines for Article 200 & 201**

   * Define when a Bill must be reserved.
   * Restrict reservation to cases involving conflict with Union law or national interest.

5. **Judicially Enforceable Definition of “Prolonged Inaction”**

   * The Court can evolve jurisprudence where unreasonable delay itself is deemed unconstitutional.

6. **Strengthening Federal Forums**

   * Inter-State Council and Zonal Councils can be used to discuss Centre–State legislative coordination.
   * National Commission to Review Centre–State Relations may be revived.

7. **Transparent Communication**

   * Governors should publicly state reasons for returning or reserving Bills, enhancing accountability.

# Rethinking a symbol of ‘environment responsibility’
## **Relaxation of Green-Cover Norms in Industrial Estates**

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

Industrial development often requires large tracts of land, leading to **loss of natural vegetation, disruption of habitats, soil disturbance, and local pollution**. To minimise such impacts, India historically mandated **green belts** — strips of vegetation within and around industrial units.

**What are green belts?**

* Vegetated buffers planted within industrial estates or around individual industries.
* Functions:

  * Regulate *microclimate*
  * Reduce *dust and pollutants*
  * Act as *noise buffers*
  * Provide *visual greening*

However, **green belts are not equivalent to natural forests**.

* They are usually **mono-cultural**, narrowly designed, and cannot restore ecological functions like biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration, or hydrological regulation.
* Their role is **mitigative**, not **restorative**.

Recently, many States and industrial regulators have **reduced mandatory green-cover requirements** (e.g., from 33% to much lower thresholds) citing ease of doing business and international comparisons.

But global comparisons often ignore India's reality:

* **High population density**
* **High pollution loads**
* **Limited natural green buffers**
* **Ecological stress in industrial clusters**

Thus, copy-pasting global norms without contextualisation becomes environmentally risky.

---

### 2. **The News**

* A **global push for simplifying industrial norms** has now influenced green-cover regulations.
* Several governments and industrial estate authorities have **reduced mandatory plantation ratios** within industrial premises and estates.
* This move is touted as improving *land-use efficiency* and facilitating *ease of doing business*.
* Environmental planners and researchers caution that:

  * Green belts mitigate pollution but **cannot compensate for the ecological loss** caused by clearing natural landscapes.
  * Industrial green belts reduce **TSP by up to 65%** and noise by **10–17 dB**, but only in **localised areas**.
  * Relaxing norms may compromise ecological resilience if not balanced by landscape-level greening.
* Policymakers often justify lower standards by citing countries with minimal green-cover mandates, but these comparisons **ignore ecological context**, population density, and environmental stress.

The broader concern:
Are we prioritising short-term convenience over long-term sustainability?

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

Although the article critiques recent relaxations, India has several existing frameworks and policies relevant to industrial greening:

**a) Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification, 2006**

* Mandates green belts as a part of mitigation measures for most major projects.
* Requires industries to propose green-cover plans.

**b) National Forest Policy, 1988**

* Aims for **33% forest cover** nationally; underscores need for ecological stability.
* Encourages afforestation and plantation on non-forest lands.

**c) Compensatory Afforestation (CA) under Forest Conservation Act**

* Industries diverting forest land must plant trees elsewhere.
* However, these plantations often do not restore ecological complexity.

**d) Green Credit Programme (2023–24)**

* Encourages voluntary tree plantation and restoration through tradable credits.
* Industries may use these credits for environmental compliance.

**e) State Industrial Policies**

* Several States have provisions for:

  * Eco-industrial parks
  * Common green zones
  * Buffer plantations
  * Wetland protection near industrial clusters

**f) ESG and CSR Frameworks**

* Companies increasingly adopt **Environmental, Social, Governance (ESG)** metrics.
* CSR activities include afforestation, water-body restoration, and community-based greening.

However, **none of these sufficiently substitute for on-site green norms**, and the reduced requirements may weaken safeguards unless coupled with stronger off-site commitments.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### **a) Issues & Challenges**

1. **Ecological Oversimplification**

   * Green belts cannot replicate natural ecosystems.
   * Plantation monocultures often degrade quickly and fail to deliver long-term ecological services.

2. **Misleading International Benchmarks**

   * Countries with lower green-cover norms often have vast natural landscapes or lower population density.
   * India's ecological vulnerability requires stricter norms.

3. **Reduced Resilience in Industrial Clusters**

   * Without sufficient green buffers, pollution concentration increases.
   * Heat stress and microclimate destabilisation become more severe.

4. **Fragmentation of Environmental Governance**

   * States apply inconsistent criteria for different industries.
   * Lack of clear scientific standards leads to confusion and weak enforcement.

5. **Favouring Ease of Doing Business over Long-Term Sustainability**

   * Norm relaxations may reduce compliance burden but compromise environmental health.

#### **b) Impacts on Society, Economy, and Environment**

**Society:**

* Reduced microclimate cooling → higher heat stress for workers and nearby communities.
* Less dust suppression → higher respiratory risks.

**Economy:**

* Short-term gains in land utilisation.
* Long-term costs via health burdens, pollution penalties, and reduced climate resilience.

**Environment:**

* Further habitat fragmentation.
* Weakening of landscape-level ecological networks.
* Reduced carbon sequestration.

**Governance & Ethics:**

* Raises the question: Should developmental convenience override ecological responsibility?
* Industries shifting from liability to stewardship is essential for ethical growth.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Adopt a Landscape-Level Approach**

   * Move from plot-level greenery to *regional ecological planning*.
   * Identify ecological corridors, buffer zones, and degraded landscapes for restoration.

2. **Hybrid On-Site + Off-Site Model**

   * Allow limited flexibility in on-site green cover.
   * Mandate:

     * Off-site plantations
     * Restoration of degraded land
     * Wetland rehabilitation
     * Riverine buffer restoration

3. **Green Credits and Accountability Mechanisms**

   * Mandate industries to meet quantifiable greening targets.
   * Use GIS-based monitoring and third-party audits.

4. **Scientific Standards for Green Belts**

   * Improve design:

     * Multi-layer vegetation
     * Native species
     * Wider buffers
   * Avoid monocultures.

5. **Ecologically Calibrated Policies**

   * Tailor green-cover requirements based on:

     * Population density
     * Local climate
     * Pollution load
     * Ecological sensitivity

6. **Promote Industries as Ecological Stewards**

   * CSR + ESG + Green Credit Programme used strategically.
   * Involving industries in river basin conservation, afforestation corridors, and wetland restoration.

7. **Citizen Participation & Transparency**

   * Community monitoring of industrial greening.
   * Public disclosure of green-cover compliance.

8. **Avoid Greenwashing**

   * Ensure plantations are not tokenistic.
   * Link compliance to survival rates, biodiversity indicators, and measurable ecological outcomes.

# Overcoming resistance
## **National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance (NAP-AMR 2.0)**

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

**Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)** occurs when microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites evolve to resist the drugs designed to kill them. This makes infections **harder to treat**, increases **hospital stays**, **treatment costs**, and **mortality**.

**Why AMR is a crisis in India:**

* High infectious disease burden
* Overuse and misuse of antibiotics (self-medication, OTC sales, unnecessary prescriptions)
* Poor sanitation and infection control
* Antibiotic use in livestock, poultry, aquaculture
* Contamination of soil, food, and water with antibiotic residues
* Weak surveillance systems and uneven healthcare quality

The **One Health** concept—integrating *human*, *animal*, and *environmental* health—is globally recognised as the only effective way to tackle AMR.

India launched its **first National Action Plan (NAP-AMR 2017–21)** aligned with WHO’s Global Action Plan. While it raised awareness and built surveillance capacity, implementation was uneven and slow.

The introduction of **NAP-AMR 2.0** acknowledges these shortcomings and attempts to re-energise the fight against AMR.

---

### 2. **The News**

* The Centre has released the **second iteration of the National Action Plan on AMR**, but full details are still not publicly available.
* This is in response to sluggish implementation of NAP 1.0, which had limited success beyond a few marginal gains.
* WHO’s **Global Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance Report (2023)** highlights:

  * **1 in 3 bacterial infections in India** are resistant to common antibiotics.
  * Global rate: **1 in 6**.
  * India’s higher vulnerability due to high infectious disease burden, antibiotic misuse, weak surveillance.
  * Critical bacteria like **E. coli** and **Klebsiella pneumoniae** show high resistance even to last-resort antibiotics.
* AMR is not limited to humans—its footprint spans **veterinary care, food systems, agriculture, aquaculture, soil, and water**.
* Kerala is the only State that effectively implemented its own AMR policy and recently saw a small reduction in community-level AMR.
* India’s laboratory surveillance network has improved due to investments during the COVID-19 pandemic.
* The **ban on Colistin** as a growth promoter in animals was a key achievement of NAP 1.0.

The new policy aims to strengthen stewardship, improve coordination with States, and adopt robust One Health strategies.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

**a) National Action Plan on AMR (2017–2021)**

* Focus on awareness, surveillance, IPC (infection prevention & control), rational antibiotic use, and R&D.
* Establishment of National Programme on AMR Containment.
* Expansion of AMR surveillance through the **Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)** and the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC).
* Integration with **Ayushman Bharat** for infection control in primary care.
* Colistin ban in animal husbandry (major success).

**b) State Action Plans**

* Few States formulated plans; Kerala was the only one with effective implementation (Kerala Antimicrobial Resistance Strategic Action Plan - KARSAP).

**c) One Health Initiatives**

* India has announced several One Health projects integrating veterinary, environmental, and human sectors.
* Establishment of the **National Institute of One Health, Nagpur**.
* AMR integrated into **National Livestock Mission**, **Blue Revolution (aquaculture)**, and food safety policies.

**d) Regulatory Steps**

* Schedule H1 rules to regulate over-the-counter sale of strong antibiotics.
* FSSAI guidelines on antibiotic residues in food.
* Gaps persist in enforcement.

**e) Global Commitments**

* Alignment with WHO’s Global Action Plan (GAP).
* Participation in GLASS (Global AMR Surveillance System).

NAP-AMR 2.0 will likely expand these initiatives while attempting to remedy gaps in implementation and State coordination.

# The new direction for India should be toward Asia
## **India at a Foreign Policy Inflection Point: Asia’s Rise, U.S.–China Dynamics, and Strategic Autonomy**

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

India’s foreign policy today is shaped by three major global trends:

1. **Shift of power from the West to Asia**

   * Asia now holds two-thirds of the world’s population and wealth.
   * China and India are emerging as major economic and technological centres.

2. **U.S.–China rivalry reshaping global alignments**

   * The U.S. is attempting to retain global dominance.
   * China’s growing influence is altering strategic equations.

3. **India’s simultaneous rise**

   * India is set to become the world’s 3rd-largest economy.
   * It is balancing relations with the U.S., China, Russia, and the Global South.

Traditional multilateralism is weakening, and countries are reorganising around **value chains, technology ecosystems, and security networks**, rather than ideological blocs.

India’s doctrine of **strategic autonomy**—once seen as non-alignment—is evolving toward **multi-alignment**, rooted in India’s independent economic and security priorities.

---

### 2. **The News**

* At the **2025 Tianjin SCO Summit**, a photograph of Modi, Putin, and Xi in deep conversation symbolised growing Asian agency, reminiscent of G-7 unity in the West.

* One month later at the **Busan “G2” Summit**, a picture of President Trump looking uneasy next to a composed Xi reflected an ongoing shift in global power centres toward Asia.

* The U.S. Secretary of State acknowledged that the **21st century will be written in Asia**.

* Yet, U.S. officials have publicly stated goals such as:

  * Pulling India away from China
  * Pressuring India to stop buying cheap Russian oil
  * Encouraging India to side with the Western bloc

* PM Modi responded that **India’s future cannot be dictated by others**, signalling independence.

* India’s foreign policy is at a critical juncture due to:

  * Improving India–China relations (including border negotiations)
  * Deepening India–Russia partnership
  * The U.S. tightening rules and reducing India’s strategic policy space
  * Asia's emergence as a unified but diverse geopolitical hub
  * The possibility of India's re-entry into the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP)

India’s options are not binary (U.S. vs China). The real opportunity lies in anchoring itself firmly within **Asia’s rising geopolitical and geo-economic architecture**.

# COP30 draft text skips mention of fossil fuel use
## **COP30 Cover Text Controversy: Fossil Fuels, Equity, and Climate Finance**

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

The **Conference of Parties (COP)** is the annual meeting of countries under the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement. Each COP ends with a **“cover text”**—a political declaration summarising collective commitments on mitigation, adaptation, finance, and implementation.

Key concepts involved:

* **Mitigation:** Reducing emissions (e.g., phasing out fossil fuels).
* **Adaptation:** Preparing for climate impacts (resilience, infrastructure).
* **NCQG (New Collective Quantified Goal):** A new global climate finance target set last year to replace the $100 billion/year goal; meant to be based on developing-country needs (likely in trillions).
* **1.5°C threshold:** Scientists warn that crossing this will cause catastrophic climate impacts.
* **Equity & CBDR-RC:** Principles that countries have *common but differentiated responsibilities* due to historical emissions and varying capacities.

Fossil fuel phase-out has become one of the most contentious issues at recent COPs, with developed countries demanding strong commitments while several developing nations—especially petro-states—argue that aggressive timelines threaten their economic security and violate equity.

---

### 2. **The News**

* At **COP30 in Belém, Brazil**, the **draft cover text did NOT mention fossil fuels**, causing immediate backlash.

* Developing countries (including oil-exporting nations) had resisted language that:

  * Calls for fossil-fuel “phase-out” or
  * Sets a timeline for ending fossil use.

* Developed countries, led by the EU, argue that:

  * Fossil fuel commitments are *indispensable* to achieving 1.5°C.
  * Finance for transition must come from both public and private sources.

* European Commissioner for Climate, **Wopke Hoekstra**, criticised the draft text, calling it **“not close to the ambition we need on mitigation.”**

* Nearly **80 countries** (a large coalition including climate-vulnerable nations) are set to voice dissatisfaction at the plenary.

* India and the broader **Global South** emphasise that climate action must be grounded in:

  * **Equity**
  * **Fair rules**
  * **Reliable support (finance + tech)**
  * Protection from **climate-linked trade barriers**

* New dialogues on climate and trade and a high-level roundtable on **NCQG implementation** were welcomed by experts.

This disagreement reflects the deeper global north–south divide on burden-sharing for climate action.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

**a) International (COP-Level Mechanisms)**

* **Paris Agreement**: Commitments to reduce global emissions and achieve net-zero mid-century.
* **Global Stocktake (GST)**: Evaluated progress and urged phase-out of unabated fossil fuels.
* **NCQG (2023)**: A new global climate finance goal for 2025 onward, linked to the finance needs of developing countries.
* **Loss and Damage Fund**: Operationalised to help climate-vulnerable nations, though funding remains insufficient.

**b) India’s Climate Position & Actions**

* Strong advocacy of **equity** and **CBDR-RC**; resists one-size-fits-all fossil phase-out.
* **Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)** include:

  * 50% installed electric capacity from non-fossil sources by 2030
  * Reduce emissions intensity by 45% from 2005 levels
  * Net-zero by 2070
* **Renewable Energy Leadership**

  * World’s largest solar expansion program
  * Green Hydrogen Mission
  * International Solar Alliance (ISA)
* **Adaptation initiatives**:

  * National Adaptation Fund
  * State Action Plans on Climate Change
  * Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI)

**c) South-South Cooperation**

* India supports developing nations through technology transfer, climate finance initiatives, and international platforms (ISA, CDRI).

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### **a) Issues & Challenges**

1. **Absence of Fossil Fuel Phase-Out Language**

   * Undermines global mitigation goals.
   * Conflicts with scientific warnings and the Global Stocktake outcomes.

2. **North–South Divide on Climate Responsibility**

   * Developed countries push for phase-out but resist firm finance commitments.
   * Developing countries argue that transitions require massive investment and fair support.

3. **Ambiguity around Climate Finance**

   * The NCQG is still undefined in scale, timelines, and contributors.
   * Risk of shifting burden to private finance without ensuring concessional public flows.

4. **Equity Concerns**

   * Least developed countries fear trade barriers (CBAM-like policies).
   * The Global South demands protection from unfair pressures.

5. **Geopolitical Pressures**

   * Oil-exporting developing nations oppose fossil phase-out.
   * Climate-vulnerable countries demand urgency.
   * Developed nations prioritise mitigation over adaptation.

6. **Dilution of COP Outcomes**

   * Weak cover text may lower global ambition post-Paris Agreement.
   * Raises credibility concerns for COP processes.

#### **b) Impacts**

**Environmental:**

* Weak commitments accelerate warming, increasing frequency of heatwaves, floods, storms.

**Economic:**

* Without financial clarity, developing economies struggle to fund green transitions.
* Risk of punitive climate-linked trade measures.

**Social:**

* Climate impacts disproportionately harm vulnerable populations.

**Political:**

* COP credibility erodes if consensus repeatedly avoids core issues such as fossil fuels.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Include Gradated Fossil-Fuel Language**

   * Terms like “phasing out unabated fossil fuels” or “transitioning away” may help build consensus.
   * Technology-based flexibility for developing nations.

2. **Strengthen NCQG Commitments**

   * Clearly define scale (trillions), timelines, and contributors.
   * Ensure predictability of public climate finance.

3. **Balance Mitigation and Adaptation**

   * Avoid an overemphasis on mitigation that sidelines adaptation needs of developing countries.

4. **Safeguard Against Climate-Linked Trade Barriers**

   * Establish rules within COP to prevent unilateral measures such as CBAM from hurting Global South economies.

5. **Amplify Equity and CBDR Principles**

   * Ensure climate responsibilities are proportional to historical emissions and current capacities.

6. **Enhance Trust Through Transparency**

   * Regular reporting on finance, technology transfer, and support mechanisms.
   * Strengthen governance of the Loss and Damage Fund.

7. **Promote Just Energy Transitions**

   * Invest in green jobs, skill development, and social protection.
   * Ensure fossil-dependent communities are not left behind.

8. **Build Developing-Country Coalitions**

   * Coordinate positions of India, Brazil, South Africa, AOSIS, and LDCs to push for fairer outcomes.

# **CJI Gavai: Faced criticism for ‘creamy layer’ verdict — Explanation**

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

**Creamy Layer Concept**

* Originally introduced in *Indra Sawhney (1992)* for **OBC reservations**, to exclude the more advanced members of OBCs from reservation benefits.
* **Historically NOT applied** to Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs), because:

  * SC/ST discrimination is rooted in **untouchability and caste-based stigma**, not just economic or educational backwardness.
  * The idea is that “advancement” does not remove the stigma of caste.

**Recent Debate**

* A 6–1 ruling (Aug 1, 2024) held that **creamy layer principles should apply to SC/ST communities as well**, meaning more advanced SC/ST individuals may be excluded from reservations in some contexts.
* Justice Gavai — who is from a Scheduled Caste community — was part of the majority holding that exclusion is justified to ensure equitable distribution **within** SCs.

This verdict triggered debate within SC communities and legal circles.

---

### 2. **The News**

During his farewell organised by the **Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA)** on November 21:

* **Chief Justice of India B.R. Gavai** said he **faced criticism from his own community** for supporting the judgment extending the creamy-layer exclusion to SCs.
* He stated that he relied on *constitutional morality, fairness*, and Ambedkarite principles of **internal equity**.
* He mentioned being *“severely criticised”* by people from his own caste background but supported by colleagues.

Other key points from the article:

* He stressed that **politics often dominates over reason and logic** in debates on reservation.
* He emphasised the independence of judiciary and tribunals.
* He reflected on his journey from a modest background to becoming India’s second Dalit CJI.
* Justice Surya Kant will succeed him as CJI on November 24.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives (Contextual)**

Although this is a judicial matter, several policies are relevant:

**a) Reservation System**

* SC/ST reservations governed by Articles **15(4)**, **16(4)**, **16(4A)**.
* Creamy layer currently applied only to OBCs by policy and judicial precedent.

**b) Scheduled Castes Orders**

* Classification within SCs has been debated in many States (e.g., Punjab, Andhra Pradesh), but the Supreme Court has often resisted sub-classification.

**c) Commission Reports**

* National Commission for SCs has opposed creamy layer for SCs.
* Some State commissions favour internal prioritisation to ensure equitable access.

**d) Supreme Court Judgments**

* *Jarnail Singh (2018)* allowed creamy-layer exclusion within OBCs for promotions, but did **not** extend it to SC/STs.
* The recent 6–1 ruling marks a **major shift**.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### **a) Issues & Challenges**

1. **Debate on Sub-classification within SCs/STs**

   * Whether the benefits of reservation are cornered by a few relatively advanced castes within SC/ST communities.

2. **Tension Between Formal Equality vs Social Justice**

   * Should economic/educational advancement disqualify SC/ST individuals from reservations?
   * Or does caste stigma continue regardless of status?

3. **Judicial Role vs Social Sentiment**

   * Courts must interpret the Constitution, but judgments on reservation often trigger political and community reactions.

4. **Impact on Reservation Policy**

   * Introducing creamy layer for SCs may reshape affirmative action in India.
   * May cause demands for reclassification, new inequalities, or resistance from marginalised groups.

5. **Judicial Independence and Public Pressure**

   * CJI Gavai subtly highlighted pressures faced by judges from communities and political narratives.

#### **b) Broader Impacts**

**Social:**

* Could create divisions within SC communities.
* May ensure fair benefit distribution but risks undermining unity and social justice objectives.

**Economic:**

* Might expand opportunities for the poorest SC/ST groups, but reduce protections for disadvantaged but upwardly mobile groups.

**Political:**

* Highly sensitive — reservation reforms often trigger agitation.
* Political parties may exploit community sentiments.

**Constitutional:**

* Raises foundational questions about equality, backwardness, and purpose of reservations.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Detailed Socio-Economic Study of Intra-Group Inequities**

   * Commission comprehensive caste-wise data to understand actual benefit distribution.

2. **Sub-Classification Debate Should Be Transparent**

   * Engage with community organisations, scholars, and State governments.

3. **Balance Between Social Justice & Internal Equity**

   * Protect historically discriminated groups while ensuring benefits reach the most deprived.

4. **Avoid Blanket Policies**

   * Consider sector-specific solutions (education, promotions, jobs, political reservations may require different approaches).

5. **Judicial–Executive Coordination**

   * Clarify the constitutional basis for creamy layer within SCs, ideally through legislative guidelines or constitutional amendment debates.

6. **Safeguard Judicial Independence**

   * Ensure judges are insulated from community pressures.
