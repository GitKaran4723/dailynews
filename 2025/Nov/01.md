# ​Chinese check
## U.S.–China Tariff Truce and Structural Power Shift in Global Trade

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Tariff War**: A trade conflict where countries impose import duties (tariffs) on each other’s goods to protect domestic industries or pressure the other side economically.
* **U.S.–China Trade War (2018–2025)**: Began under U.S. President **Donald Trump** in 2017, targeting China’s **manufacturing dominance**, **intellectual property policies**, and **trade imbalance**. China retaliated with tariffs on U.S. exports like soybeans and automobiles.
* **Tariffs and Trade Deficits**:

  * **Trade deficit**: When a country imports more than it exports.
  * Trump’s tariffs aimed to reduce the **U.S. goods trade deficit with China**, which had been a political issue in American domestic policy.
* **Dual Circulation Strategy (China)**: A policy emphasizing both **domestic economic self-reliance (“internal circulation”)** and **continued global integration (“external circulation”)** to cushion China from external shocks.
* **Neoliberal Reforms**: Refers to China’s economic liberalization starting in the 1980s, following World Bank/IMF recommendations — allowing markets, private enterprise, and foreign capital to drive growth.

---

### 2. **The News**

* **What happened**: In **Busan, South Korea**, **U.S. President Donald Trump** and **Chinese President Xi Jinping** met and announced a **détente (temporary truce)** in their long-running **tariff war**.
* **Date & Context**: This occurred amid global economic anxieties and inflationary pressures due to disrupted supply chains.
* **Details of the agreement**:

  * **U.S. concessions**:

    * Reduction of certain tariffs.
    * Pause on adding more Chinese firms to the “no-trade list.”
    * Partial rollback on tariffs linked to **fentanyl supply-chain disputes**.
  * **Chinese commitments**:

    * Resumption of **U.S. farm product imports**, especially soybeans.
    * Easing of **export restrictions on critical minerals**.
* **Outcome**: Though it signals a **temporary de-escalation**, analysts view this truce as **revealing a deeper structural power shift** between the two economies — with **China’s industrial dominance** now firmly entrenched.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

#### **U.S. Measures**

* **Tariff Strategy (2017–2024)**: Imposed tariffs worth hundreds of billions on Chinese goods to pressure Beijing to change its trade practices.
* **CHIPS and Science Act (2022)**: $280 billion investment in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing to reduce dependence on China.
* **Inflation Reduction Act (2022)**: Incentivized domestic green technology production.
* **Friend-shoring Policy**: Redirecting supply chains toward allies like **Vietnam, Mexico, and India** to reduce dependence on China.

#### **Chinese Countermeasures**

* **“Dual Circulation” Policy**: Strengthened domestic demand and innovation while retaining global export competitiveness.
* **Made in China 2025 Plan**: Focus on upgrading industries like robotics, semiconductors, and renewable energy.
* **Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)**: Deepened global supply-chain linkages through infrastructure investment.
* **Industrial Self-Reliance**: Heavy investment in indigenous R&D, especially in **AI, 5G, EVs, and chip design**.
* **Market Diversification**: Increased exports to ASEAN, Africa, and Latin America to reduce exposure to U.S. markets.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### **Issues and Challenges**

1. **Structural Power Shift**

   * The U.S. remains the **world’s largest consumer economy**, but **China has become the world’s factory** — commanding intermediate goods, critical minerals, and manufacturing ecosystems.
   * This represents a **reversal of the 20th-century trade hierarchy**: from U.S. industrial dominance to China’s production supremacy.

2. **Economic Impact**

   * U.S. tariffs reduced its trade deficit with China by 30%, but **trade flows merely shifted** to other countries (Vietnam, Mexico, ASEAN).
   * **U.S. consumers bore the cost** of tariffs through higher prices, contradicting domestic re-industrialisation narratives.
   * Chinese exporters adapted by lowering prices and entering new markets.

3. **Political Impact**

   * In the U.S., **farmers and rural communities** suffered from China’s retaliatory tariffs on soybeans and agricultural goods — hurting Trump’s voter base.
   * In China, **export workers** faced layoffs, but political fallout was contained through **stimulus spending** and **employment programs**.

4. **Strategic and Technological Contestation**

   * The rivalry has moved beyond trade into **technology, semiconductors, AI, and rare-earth minerals**, defining the contours of **21st-century economic geopolitics**.
   * **Critical minerals and supply chains** are now instruments of geopolitical leverage.

#### **Implications**

* **Global Trade Realignment**: Accelerated the rise of **ASEAN and India** as secondary supply-chain hubs.
* **Decoupling vs. Interdependence**: Despite political hostility, **U.S. and Chinese economies remain deeply intertwined** — a paradox of “rivalry within dependence.”
* **Global South Opportunity**: Emerging economies gain leverage as both powers compete for new markets and resources.
* **Governance Lessons**: Highlights **the limits of tariff-based protectionism** in a hyper-integrated world economy.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **For the United States**

   * Focus on **long-term industrial and workforce renewal**, not just tariffs.
   * Expand **innovation incentives** and **domestic supply chains** through sustainable investment.
   * Coordinate with allies (EU, Japan, India) for **collective technology resilience** rather than unilateral trade wars.

2. **For China**

   * Continue **economic diversification** to reduce vulnerability to Western sanctions.
   * Foster **domestic consumption** and reduce dependence on exports.
   * Enhance **transparency and IP protection** to ease trade tensions.

3. **For the Global Economy**

   * Strengthen **multilateral trade frameworks (WTO reform)** to handle AI, data, and critical mineral trade issues.
   * Encourage **regional value chains** and fairer trade rules benefiting developing economies.
   * Balance **innovation incentives** with **supply-chain security and inclusivity**.

4. **For India**

   * Leverage the **“China+1” strategy** to attract global manufacturing and supply-chain diversification.
   * Deepen engagement with **U.S., EU, and ASEAN** under **Make in India** and **PLI schemes**.
   * Protect national interest through **strategic trade diplomacy** that balances both powers.

---

✅ **Summary:**
The **U.S.–China tariff détente in Busan** signals not an end to the trade war but a **pause amid a deeper structural realignment**. China, once a peripheral player in the 1980s global order, has emerged as the **central hub of global manufacturing and technology**, while the U.S., constrained by short-term politics, struggles to recalibrate its industrial base. The episode underscores the **limits of tariffs**, the **resilience of Chinese industrial power**, and the **beginning of a multi-polar economic order** where long-term strategy outweighs transactional politics.

# The case for a board of peace and sustainable security
## UN at 80: Rethinking Global Peace Mechanisms through the ‘Board of Peace and Sustainable Security (BPSS)’

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **United Nations (UN)**: Founded in **1945**, the UN’s core purpose is to prevent war, uphold peace, and promote cooperation among nations. Its **Security Council (UNSC)** is the main body responsible for international peace and security.
* **UN Security Council (UNSC)**: Composed of **5 permanent members (P5)** — U.S., U.K., France, Russia, China — and **10 elected members**, it can authorize sanctions, peacekeeping, and military interventions.
* **Problem**: The UNSC is **reactive, episodic, and constrained by veto politics**. It can respond to crises but rarely sustains peace. Its structure reflects the power realities of **post-World War II**, not today’s multipolar world.
* **Peacebuilding Commission (PBC)**: Established in 2005 to help post-conflict recovery, but lacks authority and continuity to maintain political engagement during transitions.
* **Sustainable Security**: A concept linking **peace, governance, and inclusion** — suggesting that peace must be politically and institutionally sustained, not merely militarily maintained.

---

### 2. **The News**

* **Occasion**: On the **80th anniversary** of the United Nations (2025), discussions on reform have intensified.
* **Context**: The world is witnessing **protracted conflicts** (Ukraine, Gaza, Sudan, Myanmar) that the UN has failed to resolve or sustain peace in, exposing its **institutional limitations**.
* **Issue Identified**:

  * The UNSC **reacts** to conflict but fails to **maintain long-term engagement**.
  * Diplomacy has become **“crisis theatre”** — initiated too late and withdrawn too soon.
  * No existing UN body ensures **political continuity** once active mediation ends.
* **Proposed Solution**: Creation of a **“Board of Peace and Sustainable Security (BPSS)”** under **Article 22 of the UN Charter**, which allows the General Assembly to form subsidiary bodies.
* **Objective**: To **fill the institutional gap** between peacekeeping and political transition — ensuring sustained, structured political engagement in conflict zones even after violence subsides.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Institutional Proposals**

#### **Proposed Role and Design of BPSS**

* **Mandate**:

  * To accompany political processes during and after conflicts.
  * To ensure **peace agreements are implemented**, not forgotten.
  * To align peacekeeping with **achievable political goals**.
  * To subsume and expand the role of the **Peacebuilding Commission (PBC)**.

* **Functions**:

  * Support **nationally-led dialogue** and reconciliation.
  * Coordinate **regional diplomatic efforts**.
  * Provide **continuity** in UN political engagement between mediation and peacebuilding phases.
  * Work with the **Secretary-General** and **UNSC** without undermining their authority.

#### **Structure & Representation**

* **Composition**: ~24 rotating member states, elected by the **UN General Assembly** for fixed terms.
* **Representation**: Regional balance (Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, West Asia).
* **Regional Organisations**: (e.g., **AU, ASEAN, EU, CELAC**) will participate directly, not as observers.
* **Decision Process**:

  * No **permanent members** or **veto powers**.
  * Agenda items introduced only by member-states, regional bodies, or the Secretary-General.
  * **Civil society** can have consultative but not voting roles.

#### **Philosophy: Sustainable Security**

* Peace is **not preventive intervention**, but **political accompaniment**.
* Stability emerges from **inclusive governance and negotiated settlements**, not imposed external solutions.
* Links **security, governance, development, and legitimacy** as part of the same continuum.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### **Issues and Challenges**

1. **Structural Inertia in the UN System**

   * The UNSC’s design from 1945 no longer reflects today’s power realities.
   * The **veto system** often paralyses collective action (e.g., Syria, Gaza).
   * Peacekeeping lacks long-term political strategies; missions become **indefinite holding operations**.

2. **Institutional Fragmentation**

   * Absence of coordination between **peacekeeping**, **peacebuilding**, and **political mediation** weakens continuity.
   * The PBC lacks enforcement power and political mandate.

3. **Erosion of Multilateral Trust**

   * Member-states view the UN as either **ineffective** or **dominated by major powers**.
   * Decline in global confidence in UN’s ability to sustain peace.

4. **Geopolitical Polarisation**

   * Rivalries between major powers (U.S., China, Russia) hinder consensus in the UNSC.
   * Conflicts are prolonged by **proxy interests** rather than resolved through diplomacy.

#### **Impacts and Significance**

* **Restores Political Continuity**: Ensures UN stays engaged post-conflict, avoiding relapse into violence.
* **Enhances Representation**: Reduces dominance of P5; strengthens **Global South voice** in peace processes.
* **Institutional Innovation Without Charter Reform**: Utilises **Article 22** to innovate within the existing legal framework.
* **Promotes Sustainable Security**: Integrates peace with governance and development goals — aligns with **SDG 16 (Peace, Justice & Strong Institutions)**.

#### **Global Governance Implications**

* Could make the UN **more agile, inclusive, and effective**.
* Revives **multilateralism** at a time of fragmentation.
* Bridges the gap between **peacekeeping mandates and political realities**.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Institutionalise the BPSS Concept**

   * The **UN General Assembly** should pilot BPSS as a **subsidiary body** with limited but practical mandates.
   * Initial focus: **post-conflict societies** (e.g., Sudan, Myanmar, Haiti).

2. **Integrate Regional Partnerships**

   * Formalise cooperation between BPSS and regional bodies (e.g., **AU, ASEAN, SAARC**) to ensure local ownership.

3. **Ensure Political Neutrality and Sovereignty Respect**

   * BPSS should assist, not dictate — maintaining **national leadership** in peace processes.

4. **Strengthen UN Institutional Memory**

   * Create **knowledge repositories** and continuity frameworks for long-term tracking of peace agreements.

5. **Balance Reform Ambition with Pragmatism**

   * Pursue **functional reforms** like BPSS now while continuing efforts toward **structural reform** (e.g., UNSC expansion).

6. **Promote Inclusive Diplomacy**

   * Encourage **multi-level diplomacy** involving civil society, women’s groups, and local leaders for sustainable reconciliation.

---

✅ **Summary:**
As the **UN marks 80 years**, it faces a crisis of relevance — reacting to wars but failing to sustain peace. The proposed **Board of Peace and Sustainable Security (BPSS)** offers a **realistic, functional reform** to bridge this gap. It would provide **continuity, representation, and political accompaniment** during fragile transitions, without altering the Charter’s power structure. By aligning diplomacy with governance and development, BPSS embodies **“sustainable security”** — a modern, inclusive vision of peace.

This proposal reflects a crucial lesson: **reform need not await consensus on grand restructuring; it can begin with pragmatic innovation within the system.**

# Trump drops a bomb, on U.S. nuclear weapons testing
## U.S. Resumption of Nuclear Testing: A Threat to Global Non-Proliferation Stability

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

* **Nuclear Testing**: The detonation of nuclear weapons under controlled conditions, historically used to validate design efficiency and yield. Such tests have immense military, environmental, and geopolitical consequences.
* **Moratorium on Nuclear Testing**: An **informal global halt** on nuclear tests since the late 1990s — though not legally binding, it functioned as a powerful **norm of restraint**.
* **Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)**: Adopted in **1996**, bans all nuclear explosions. However, it **has not entered into force** since key nations — including the **U.S., China, North Korea, India, and Pakistan** — have not ratified it.
* **Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)**: Entered into force in **1970**, it rests on a **“grand bargain”**:

  * Nuclear states commit to disarmament.
  * Non-nuclear states commit not to acquire nuclear weapons.
* **New START Treaty**: The last major **U.S.-Russia arms control treaty**, limiting deployed strategic warheads and delivery systems. It expires in **February 2026**.
* **Doomsday Clock**: A symbolic representation of how close humanity is to global catastrophe (maintained by the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists). At **89 seconds to midnight**, it is currently at its most dangerous setting ever.

---

### 2. **The News**

* **What happened**:
  On **October 2025**, **U.S. President Donald Trump** announced on **Truth Social** that the United States would **resume nuclear weapons testing**, ending a **33-year moratorium** that began after the Cold War.

* **Why it matters**:
  The announcement came shortly after:

  * **Russia’s test of a nuclear-capable cruise missile**, and
  * **Trump’s meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping**, raising fears of a renewed **nuclear arms race**.

* **Immediate reactions**:

  * **China’s Foreign Ministry** urged the U.S. to uphold its **CTBT commitments**.
  * Analysts warn the move may trigger **reciprocal testing** by China and Russia.
  * The **global non-proliferation system**, built over five decades, now stands on fragile ground.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Global Frameworks**

#### **Key Treaties and Institutions Involved**

1. **Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT, 1970)**

   * Foundation of global nuclear restraint.
   * Obligates five recognized nuclear states (U.S., Russia, U.K., France, China) to pursue disarmament.
   * Non-nuclear states pledge not to develop weapons.
   * Review Conference scheduled for **2026**, already under strain due to lack of progress.

2. **Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT, 1996)**

   * Prohibits all nuclear explosions.
   * Signed by the U.S. but **never ratified** by its Senate.
   * Has functioned through voluntary compliance — now under threat.

3. **New START (2010)**

   * Limits U.S. and Russian deployed warheads to **1,550** each.
   * Expiring in **February 2026**, its renewal is now uncertain if nuclear testing resumes.

4. **Other Initiatives**

   * **No-First Use (NFU) Policy**: Advocated by China and India, but not accepted by the U.S.
   * **Nuclear Weapon Free Zones (NWFZ)**: Regional treaties in Latin America, Africa, Southeast Asia, etc.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### **Issues and Challenges**

1. **Breakdown of Nuclear Restraint**

   * The moratorium acted as a **de facto global standard**; breaking it risks **legitimizing tests worldwide**.
   * Could prompt **China, Russia, India, Pakistan, and North Korea** to resume or accelerate nuclear programmes.

2. **Erosion of Arms Control Architecture**

   * NPT and CTBT credibility weakened; their enforcement mechanisms are voluntary.
   * With **New START expiring**, there is a **vacuum in strategic arms control**.

3. **Geopolitical Fallout**

   * **U.S.–China** and **U.S.–Russia** relations will deteriorate further.
   * Russia and China could test next-generation **tactical or hypersonic nuclear weapons**.
   * Regional instability:

     * If China tests, **India** may feel pressured to respond.
     * A potential **India–Pakistan escalation** could follow.

4. **Ethical and Humanitarian Concerns**

   * Resuming testing disregards the historical suffering caused by nuclear fallout (Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Pacific Islands).
   * Symbolically undermines the moral legitimacy of the nuclear powers.

5. **Security Dilemma Intensified**

   * Every state’s attempt to increase security decreases others’ security — leading to **arms races** and reduced stability.

#### **Impacts**

* **Strategic**: Increases risk of a new **global arms race** reminiscent of the Cold War.
* **Diplomatic**: Weakens global trust in the U.S. as a leader of non-proliferation.
* **Environmental**: Atmospheric or underground testing can cause long-term **radiation contamination**.
* **Economic**: Diverts billions from social sectors toward renewed weapons programs.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Revive Global Dialogue**

   * Convene an **emergency session of the NPT Review Conference** and reaffirm commitment to disarmament.
   * Encourage **U.S., Russia, and China** to begin **trilateral arms control talks** — the first of their kind.

2. **Strengthen Legal Commitments**

   * Push for **U.S. ratification of the CTBT**; establish stronger verification mechanisms through the **International Monitoring System (IMS)**.
   * Encourage a **binding “No-First-Use” declaration** among nuclear powers.

3. **Regional Stability Initiatives**

   * Promote **India–Pakistan confidence-building measures (CBMs)**.
   * Reinforce **nuclear risk-reduction centers** and communication hotlines.

4. **Rebuild Norms and Morality of Restraint**

   * Global leaders must reaffirm that nuclear weapons are **deterrents, not usable tools of war**.
   * Civil society, think tanks, and peace movements must revive the **anti-nuclear narrative**.

5. **Leverage Multilateral Platforms**

   * Use **UN General Assembly**, **Conference on Disarmament**, and **IAEA** to isolate testing states diplomatically.
   * Encourage **middle powers (India, Japan, Germany, South Africa)** to lead a coalition advocating restraint.

6. **Reinforce Scientific and Environmental Oversight**

   * Establish global norms for **radiation monitoring** and **compensation frameworks** for test-affected areas.

---

✅ **Summary:**
President Trump’s decision to **resume U.S. nuclear testing** after 33 years represents a **historic reversal of global non-proliferation norms**. It undermines the **NPT’s moral foundation**, risks a **renewed arms race**, and erodes decades of progress toward disarmament.
If managed wisely, this crisis could still serve as a **wake-up call** to strengthen global non-proliferation regimes through **dialogue, treaties, and renewed diplomacy**.
In the current climate of rising geopolitical mistrust, **functional cooperation between the U.S., China, and Russia** — possibly through a **trilateral arms control framework** — is the only way to prevent a return to Cold War–era nuclear brinkmanship.
