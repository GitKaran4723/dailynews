# Goa tops in digitisation of SIR forms, Kerala lags
## **Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of Electoral Rolls – Progress & Concerns**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

**Electoral Roll:**
A list of all eligible voters in a constituency. It is the backbone of free and fair elections.

**Why Special Intensive Revision (SIR)?**

* To ensure the voter list is accurate, updated, and free of errors.
* Helps remove duplicate entries, include new voters (especially 18+), and update details.

**Key Steps in the SIR Process:**

1. **Enumeration Phase:**

   * Forms are distributed to households.
   * BLOs collect them after citizens fill details.
   * Data is digitised and uploaded.

2. **Draft Publication:**

   * A provisional voter list is released.

3. **Claims & Objections:**

   * Citizens can correct details, register, or object to wrong entries.

4. **Final Roll Publication:**

   * After verification, the updated voter list becomes official.

**Role of Booth-Level Officers (BLOs):**
They personally visit households, collect data, verify identity, and upload information—making them central to the entire revision process.

# SC to hear plea to stop cash donations to political parties
## **Regulating Cash Donations to Political Parties – Supreme Court to Examine Plea**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

**Political Funding in India:**
Political parties require funds for campaigns, organisational work, and elections. Funding sources include:

* Cash donations
* Cheques and bank transfers
* Electoral bonds (now struck down)
* Corporate contributions
* Membership fees and small donations

**Transparency Challenge:**
Cash donations are hard to trace. They may result in:

* Opaque funding

* Black money entering the political system
* Unequal playing field among parties

**Section 13A of the Income Tax Act, 1961:**
A special provision giving **tax exemption** to political parties, provided they:

* Maintain proper books of accounts
* Get audited by a chartered accountant
* Maintain records of contributions above ₹20,000
* File returns on time

**Clause (d) of Section 13A:**
Allows parties to receive **cash donations up to ₹2,000 without disclosing the donor’s identity**.
This is currently legal but widely criticised for enabling untraceable money in politics.

---

### **2. The News**

* The **Supreme Court**, on Monday, agreed to **hear a petition** seeking a ban on **cash donations of even up to ₹2,000** to political parties.
* The petition wants *all* political contributions—irrespective of the amount—to be brought under the **income-tax regime** and subjected to full disclosure.
* A Bench of **Justices Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta** issued notice to:

  * **Election Commission (EC)**
  * **Union government**
  * **Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT)**
  * **13 major political parties** (BJP, Congress, DMK, CPI(M), TMC, SP, AAP, etc.)
* The petitioner, **Khem Singh Bhati**, has challenged the **legality of Section 13A(d)** of the Income Tax Act, which allows cash donations up to ₹2,000 without donor disclosure.
* The plea argues that **all donations should be traceable** for genuine electoral transparency.

# Labour and honour
## **Implementation of the Four Labour Codes – Opportunities, Concerns & the Road Ahead**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

**What are the Four Labour Codes?**
Between 2019–2020, India consolidated **29 central labour laws** into **4 simplified Labour Codes**:

1. **Code on Wages (2019):**

   * Standardises minimum wages, payment of wages, bonus rules.
   * Applies to all workers (earlier laws applied only to specific categories).

2. **Industrial Relations Code (2020):**

   * Governs strikes, lockouts, layoffs, retrenchment, trade unions.
   * Aims to create flexible labour markets.

3. **Social Security Code (2020):**

   * Merges 9 laws on EPF, ESI, maternity benefits, gratuity, gig/platform workers’ social security.

4. **Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions (OSHWC) Code (2020):**

   * Consolidates laws on workplace safety, health standards, working hours, factory registrations.

**Why Were the Codes Created?**

* To simplify a highly complex and outdated labour law system.
* To improve India’s *Ease of Doing Business* ranking.
* To create a unified national labour market.
* To improve compliance and reduce paperwork for industries.

**Why Were They Delayed?**

* States must frame Rules—labour is a concurrent subject.
* COVID-19 disruptions.
* Trade union resistance.
* Need for greater consensus.

---

### **2. The News**

* The **Centre has now announced implementation** of the four Labour Codes after years of delay.
* The reform is being celebrated by businesses as a transformational step that will reduce compliance burden dramatically.
* The Codes replace **29 separate labour laws** and bring major changes to wages, industrial relations, social security, and occupational safety.
* Most States/UTs have already published **draft Rules**; the Centre will help States finalize them.
* India needs to generate about **78.5 lakh non-farm jobs annually till 2030** (Economic Survey 2023–24).
* However, labour unions argue that the Codes:

  * ignore pro-worker recommendations of the **Second National Commission on Labour (2002)**,
  * favour employer flexibility over job security,
  * and were passed without adequate consultation.
* The editorial stresses the need to revive the **Indian Labour Conference (ILC)**—last held in 2015—before implementing the Codes.
* With technological disruptions (AI, gig work), global conflicts, and climate challenges, the need for a balanced and inclusive labour reform is greater than ever.

# Society must reclaim respectful, open dialogue
## **Crisis of Neutrality and Polarisation in Public Discourse**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

**Neutrality & Balanced Judgment:**
Neutrality means approaching social and political issues without prejudice, with an open mind, and with commitment to reasoned evaluation. It is foundational to:

* Democratic decision-making
* Judicial independence
* Ethical governance
* Social harmony

**What is Polarisation?**
A deep ideological divide where people cluster into rigid opposing camps (e.g., left vs right), refusing dialogue or compromise. It turns differences into hostility.

**Why Has Public Discourse Eroded?**

* **Rise of sensationalist media** that rewards outrage.
* **Social media algorithms** designed to provoke emotional reactions.
* **Echo chambers** that isolate people from opposing viewpoints.
* **Profit models** of media and politics that benefit from conflict.
* **Decline of critical thinking and dialogue culture**.

In such an environment, neutrality is not just dismissed — it is attacked as weakness or betrayal.

---

### **2. The News**

The article highlights a **growing crisis in public discourse**, where:

* Respectful conversation has been replaced by confrontation.
* People are pressured into **binary ideological identities**.
* Neutral or balanced voices are mocked, marginalised, or silenced.
* Leaders, mediators, and decision-makers face emotional exhaustion because compromise is framed as betrayal.
* Even institutions such as legislatures, courts, and public forums are increasingly perceived through partisan lenses.

The text emphasises that **polarisation has become existential**, impacting politics, governance, institutions, personal well-being, and social cohesion.

---

### **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

While not explicitly mentioned in the article, several Indian initiatives and institutional mechanisms relate to restoring healthy discourse and reducing polarisation:

1. **Constitutional Safeguards**

   * **Preamble values** of justice, liberty, equality, fraternity.
   * **Article 19 freedoms**, balanced by reasonable restrictions to prevent hate speech.
   * **Independent judiciary** to safeguard neutrality.

2. **Regulatory Measures**

# Bridging India’s numeracy gap
## **Numeracy Gap & NIPUN Bharat Mission**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

**Foundational Literacy and Numeracy (FLN)**

* FLN refers to the ability of children to read with comprehension and perform basic mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) by Class 3.
* It forms the base on which all higher-order learning is built.
* **NEP 2020** identifies FLN as *“the highest priority”*, acknowledging that without foundational skills, children cannot progress meaningfully in the schooling system.

**Numeracy vs. Literacy**

* **Literacy** shows steady improvement because language learning is *continuous*, and partial comprehension still allows some progress.
* **Numeracy**, however, is *cumulative and hierarchical*, meaning:

  * Missing a basic concept (like place value) blocks future learning (decimals, fractions, algebra).
  * Gaps widen over years, making later mathematics frustrating and inaccessible.

**Teaching-at-the-Right-Level (TaRL)**

* Developed by Pratham, this approach groups students by learning level, not by grade.
* Proven effective in improving foundational learning, especially numeracy.

---

### **2. The News**

* **ASER 2024** highlights a persistent and significant numeracy gap in India.
* **48.7%** of Class 5 children can read fluently, but **only 30.7%** can solve a basic division problem — an **18 percentage point gap**.
* No State performs better in numeracy than literacy.
* Even in Class 8, **more than 50%** cannot complete basic division.
* NIPUN Bharat Mission has improved learning outcomes, but **numeracy lags behind literacy** across States.
* Evidence from **Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Daman & Diu** shows that extending FLN interventions to middle school improves outcomes (Parakh Rashtriya Survekshan 2024).

# Widely quoted WHO norm of 1 doctor per 1,000 people is not official
## **Doctor–Population Ratio & Misuse of WHO Benchmark**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

**Doctor–Population Ratio**

* This ratio measures healthcare availability by comparing the total number of doctors with the total population (e.g., 1:1,000 = one doctor per 1,000 people).
* It became widely cited as a global “standard”, but **WHO has never officially recommended a fixed doctor–population ratio**.

**Composite Health Workforce Benchmark (WHO)**

* Instead of separate benchmarks for doctors, nurses, or midwives, WHO uses a **combined threshold** to monitor global health worker adequacy.
* Current benchmark: **4.45 doctors + nurses + midwives per 1,000 population**.
* This reflects the team-based nature of modern healthcare.

**Why fixed doctor ratios are problematic**

* Health needs vary across countries, populations, disease burden, and economic realities.
* Workforce planning must be based on **local health labour market dynamics**, not a universal standard.

---

### **2. The News**

* Government replies in Parliament (2015 and 2024) cited the **1:1,000 doctor–population ratio**, presenting it as a WHO benchmark — despite earlier official statements (pre-2010) saying WHO had **no such standard**.
* To meet the 1:1,000 benchmark on paper, the government:

  * Counted only **80% availability** for allopathic doctors;
  * But counted **100% availability** for AYUSH practitioners.
* WHO clarified to *The Hindu* that:

  * It **never** prescribed country-level doctor ratios.
  * Ratios should depend on national needs and health system structures.
* Experts like **Dr. Chandrakant Lahariya** and **Dr. Kiran Kumbhar** confirmed there is **no WHO source** recommending the 1:1,000 figure.
* The earliest official Indian source for 1:1,000 appears in **MCI’s Vision 2015 (2011)**, not WHO.
* WHO explained the valid global benchmark: **4.45 skilled health workers per 1,000**.
* India's current position:

  * **0.7 doctors per 1,000** — rank **118/181**.
  * **3.06 composite (doctors + nurses + midwives)** — rank **122/181**, below the 4.45 threshold.
* Experts argue that India does not lack doctors overall; the real crisis is the **rural–urban distribution gap**, not the national average.

---

### **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

**Regulatory Bodies & Policies**

* **Medical Council of India (now NMC)**: Vision 2015 proposed the 1:1,000 target.
* **National Medical Commission (NMC)**: Expansion of medical seats, regulation of medical colleges.

**Increasing Medical Workforce Supply**

* Creation of new AIIMS.
* Centrally Sponsored Scheme for medical colleges in underserved districts.

---

### **4. Mains Relevance**

#### **A. Key Issues**

1. **Misrepresentation of Global Standards**

   * The government’s use of a non-existent WHO benchmark reflects data inconsistency and weak evidence-based policymaking.

2. **Rural–Urban Disparity**

   * Urban areas have surplus doctors; rural regions face acute shortages.
   * Doctor availability is not uniform across States.

3. **Composite Workforce Misunderstanding**

   * WHO’s 4.45 threshold is frequently broken down wrongly to justify increasing medical colleges or adding AYUSH practitioners.

4. **Overemphasis on Doctor Numbers**

   * Real issues lie in:

     * Poor distribution,
     * Weak primary healthcare,
     * Overburdened nurses and midwives,
     * Lack of team-based care approach.

5. **Politics of Workforce Calculation**

   * Including AYUSH without availability adjustments creates inflated figures.
   * The debate is used to legitimize expansion of institutions rather than strengthening service delivery.

---

#### **B. Impacts**

**On Health Governance**

* Incorrect benchmarks lead to **misallocation of resources**, such as excessive focus on building medical colleges.

**On Public Health**

* Weak primary care persists, especially in rural and tribal regions.
* Population health outcomes remain suboptimal despite rising doctor numbers.

**On Equity**

* Urban concentration of doctors widens regional inequalities.
* Rural citizens face poor access, pushing them towards unregulated healthcare providers.

**On Policy Credibility**

* Inconsistent parliamentary statements dilute institutional transparency and trust.

---

### **5. Way Forward**

#### **A. Use Evidence-Based Benchmarks**

* Adopt WHO’s composite threshold (4.45/1,000) as a monitoring tool.
* Avoid misquoting international norms.

* Plan based on disease burden, local health needs, epidemiological transition.

#### **E. Integrate AYUSH Carefully**

* Clarify roles, standardize training, ensure complementary—not substitutive—positions.
* Apply availability factors uniformly while calculating ratios.

#### **F. Reduce Political Misuse of Ratios**

* Parliamentary responses must align with validated data.
* Encourage independent audits of workforce statistics.

#### **G. Focus on Skill Mix**

* Build balanced teams: doctors + nurses + midwives + paramedics.
* Strengthen nursing and midwifery education.

# Gavi, UNICEF ink deal to provide easy access to malaria vaccine
## **Gavi–UNICEF Agreement on Affordable R21 Malaria Vaccines**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

**Malaria & Need for Vaccines**

* Malaria is caused by the *Plasmodium* parasite and spread through *Anopheles* mosquitoes.
* It remains a leading killer of children in sub-Saharan Africa.
* Vaccination is a breakthrough because malaria parasites are biologically complex and difficult to target.

**Role of Gavi**

* A global vaccine alliance that finances and supports vaccination programmes in low-income countries.
* Works through market-shaping: negotiating lower prices, ensuring steady supply, and integrating vaccines into national programmes.

**Role of UNICEF**

* World’s largest vaccine purchaser (nearly 3 billion doses/year).
* Manages procurement, transport, and distribution for global immunisation efforts.

**WHO Prequalification**

* WHOs prequalification ensures that vaccines meet global standards of quality, safety, and effectiveness.
* Two prequalified malaria vaccines:

  * **RTS,S/AS01** (GSK, PATH)
  * **R21/Matrix-M** (Oxford + Serum Institute of India with Novavax adjuvant technology)

---

### **2. The News**

* **Gavi and UNICEF** have signed a new agreement to make the **R21/Matrix-M malaria vaccine** more **affordable and accessible**.
* UNICEF will implement the agreement; Gavi will finance it through an **advance payment mechanism**, enabled by **IFFIm (International Finance Facility for Immunisation)**.
* The new price: **$2.99 per dose**, expected to take effect in about a year.
* The deal is projected to save **up to $90 million**, allowing procurement of **30 million additional doses** — enough to fully vaccinate **~7 million more children** over the next five years.
* To date, Gavi’s programme has delivered **40+ million malaria vaccine doses**.
* **24 African countries**, representing 70% of the global malaria burden, have already incorporated the vaccines into routine immunisation.

---

# What does the SC’s advisory opinion imply?
## **Supreme Court’s Opinion on the Presidential Reference under Article 143**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

**What is a Presidential Reference (Article 143)?**

* Under **Article 143**, the President may refer to the Supreme Court questions of law or public importance for its **advisory opinion**.
* The opinion is *not binding*, but carries great constitutional authority.
* It is used in situations where institutional conflicts or constitutional ambiguities require judicial clarification.

**Articles 200 and 201 (Assent to State Bills)**

* **Article 200:** Governor’s options when a State Bill is presented:

  1. Assent
  2. Withhold assent (and return the Bill)
  3. Reserve for consideration of the President
* **Article 201:** President may assent or withhold assent to Bills reserved for his consideration.

**Article 142**

* Gives the Supreme Court power to pass orders necessary “for complete justice”.
* Cannot be used to **override express constitutional provisions**.

**Context of Federal Friction**

* Increasing tensions between State governments and Governors over delays in assent to Bills.
* The Tamil Nadu case triggered a constitutional conversation on timelines and justiciability.

---

### **2. The News — What Happened**

* A **five-judge Bench** of the Supreme Court has delivered its advisory opinion on a **Presidential reference** issued after the *State of Tamil Nadu vs. Governor* judgment (April 2025).

* The April 2025 decision had:

  * Imposed a **three-month timeline** on Governors/President for deciding on Bills.
  * Stated that actions of Governors and President are **judicially reviewable**.
  * Exercised Article 142 to grant “**deemed assent**” to several Tamil Nadu Bills.

* The Union government sought clarity on the correctness of this judgment.

* The reference raised **14 questions**, primarily relating to Articles 200, 201, timelines, justiciability, and the scope of Article 142.

---

### **3. Government Interventions & Institutional Mechanisms**

**Commissions & Committees on Centre–State Relations**

* **Sarkaria Commission (1987)**:

  * Governor’s discretion should be very limited; reservation of Bills only in rare cases.
* **Punchhi Commission (2010)**:

  * Recommended **six-month** limit for Governors to decide on Bills.

**Judicial Precedents**

* **Shamsher Singh (1974)**: Governor bound by ministerial advice except in narrow discretionary areas.
* **Nabam Rebia (2016)**: Reaffirmed the limits on gubernatorial discretion.

**Constitutional Provisions**

* Articles 153–167 outline powers, duties, and limitations of the Governor.
* Article 200 governs assent procedures; no explicit timeline exists.

---

### **4. Mains Relevance**

#### **A. Key Findings of the Supreme Court’s Current Opinion**

1. **Governor has three constitutional options** under Article 200 (assent, withhold, reserve).
2. **These functions fall under discretionary power** of the Governor, independent of Council of Ministers.
3. **No judicially imposed timelines** can be prescribed for Governor or President where Constitution is silent.
4. **Decisions under Articles 200 and 201 are not justiciable** *before* a Bill becomes law.
5. **Courts can issue only a “limited mandamus”** in extreme cases of prolonged inaction (urging Governor to *act* but not directing *how* to act).
6. **Article 142 cannot substitute constitutional authority**, thus **“deemed assent” is unconstitutional**.

This **overrules the spirit** of the 2025 Tamil Nadu judgment.

---

#### **B. Issues & Constitutional Concerns**

1. **Expansion of Gubernatorial Discretion**

   * Goes against earlier landmark judgments (Shamsher Singh, Nabam Rebia).
   * Risks enabling Governors to delay or obstruct State legislation — affecting **legislative intent** and **federal balance**.

2. **No Timelines = Continuing Federal Tensions**

   * Punchhi Commission suggested time limits; Supreme Court itself fixed timelines in other contexts (e.g., Speaker in K.M. Singh, 2020).
   * By refusing to set timelines, judicial vacuum persists.

3. **Justiciability Restrictions**

   * Bars courts from reviewing Governor/President’s actions until Bill becomes law, leaving States without remedies during delays.

4. **Weakening Cooperative Federalism**

   * The opinion could embolden political misuse of the gubernatorial office.
   * Affects functioning of elected State governments and undermines democratic mandate.

5. **Scope of Article 142 Reined In**

   * Clarifies that Article 142 cannot correct constitutional omissions — important for separation of powers, but reduces flexibility in federal disputes.

#### **C. Impact on Governance**

* **Legislative Paralysis** in States where Governor–Government relations are strained.
* **Policy Delays** affecting public welfare schemes.
* **Rise in Constitutional Litigation**, increasing burden on higher judiciary.
* **Risk of centralisation**, weakening the federal structure (a basic feature per Kesavananda Bharati).

---

### **5. Way Forward**

#### **A. Codify Timelines Through Constitutional Amendment or Legislation**

* Parliament can incorporate a **90-day or 6-month limit** (as suggested by Punchhi Commission).
* Clear timelines reduce arbitrariness and friction.

#### **B. Strengthen Federal Norms & Conventions**

* Promote constitutional conventions on gubernatorial conduct (as in Westminster systems).
* Governors must act as **neutral constitutional umpires**, not political players.

#### **C. Judicial Clarification on “Discretion”**

* Future benches must narrow and define discretionary powers under Article 200 to prevent misuse.

#### **D. Restoring Cooperative Federalism**

* Centre–State consultations via Inter-State Council, Zonal Councils, and Governors’ Conference.

#### **E. Transparency & Accountability**

* Annual public reports on gubernatorial decisions on Bills.
* Internal timelines for Raj Bhavan administrative processes.

#### **F. Encourage Speedy Decision-Making**

* Governors should adopt a practice of **“responsible urgency”** to avoid legislative blockages.

# Why do infant deaths persist in tribal-dominated Melghat?
## **Malnutrition and Infant Deaths in Melghat: A Deepening Crisis**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

**Where is Melghat?**

* Melghat is a tribal, forested, hilly region in **Amravati district, Maharashtra**.
* Dominated by the **Korku tribal community**, known for high levels of poverty, undernutrition, inadequate healthcare access, and geographic isolation.

**Key Health Indicators Relevant to the Crisis**

* **Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM):** Children with extremely low weight-for-height; high risk of mortality.
* **Infant Mortality Rate (IMR):** Number of infant deaths per 1,000 live births.
* **Intergenerational Malnutrition:** Mothers entering pregnancy underweight/anaemic → low-birth-weight babies → weakened immunity → higher mortality.

**Structural Vulnerabilities in Tribal Regions**

* Poor road connectivity, lack of electricity, poor access to healthcare, low socio-economic indicators, and frequent denial of timely treatment.

---

### **2. The News**

* **Bombay High Court** criticised both **Maharashtra and Union governments** for their “extremely casual” handling of **infant deaths due to malnutrition in Melghat**.
* Between **June 2025 and November 2025**, at least **65 infants aged 0–6 months** died.
* Over **220 children** in the region fall under **Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM)**; about **50% risk death without immediate intervention**.
* Historical data:

  * **April 2024–March 2025:** 96 infant deaths.
  * Last 7 months of 2025: **61 deaths**.
* Government officials argue deaths occurred due to pneumonia, sickle cell disease, anaemia etc., but petitioners say **malnutrition is an underlying factor** accelerating mortality.
* Maharashtra’s Poshan Tracker records **1,82,443 malnourished children** statewide.
* Maharashtra continues to have **35% stunted** and **35% underweight** children (IIPS).

### **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

**A. Nutrition & ICDS Framework**

* **Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS)**: Anganwadi services, supplementary nutrition, growth monitoring, pre-school education.
* **Village Child Development Centres (VCDCs)**: Focused monitoring for SAM children.
* **Hot cooked meal scheme**: Eggs, bananas, and supplementary nutrition.
* **Poshan Abhiyaan (2018)**: Technology-driven monitoring via Poshan Tracker, behavioural change communication.

**B. Tribal & Health Schemes**

* **National Health Mission (NHM):** Strengthening PHCs, CHCs, maternal & child health services.
* **Janani Suraksha Yojana, Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram:** Institutional deliveries & maternal healthcare.
* **Tribal Sub-Plan funds** for infrastructure, nutrition, and health interventions.

**C. State-Specific Actions**

* Incentives for doctors to work in remote, tribal areas.
* Nutrition rehabilitation centres (NRCs).
* Home-based newborn care via ASHA programme.

**D. Welfare Schemes Relevant to Tribal Health**

* **PM-JAY (Ayushman Bharat)** for hospitalisation.
* **PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY)** for food security.
* **Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana** for maternal nutrition.

Despite these schemes, outcomes remain weak because of **poor coordination**, weak monitoring, and persistent systemic gaps.

### **4. Mains Relevance**

#### **A. Issues & Challenges**

1. **Geographical Barriers**

   * Remote hamlets, poor roads, lack of transport → delayed treatment → preventable deaths.

2. **Healthcare Workforce Crisis**

   * Chronic shortage of paediatricians, gynaecologists, nurses.
   * High absenteeism despite incentives.
   * Limited quality of healthcare at PHCs and sub-centres.

3. **Siloed Government Departments**

   * Poor coordination between health, WCD, tribal development, PDS, and rural development departments → inconsistent nutrition delivery.

4. **Intergenerational Malnutrition**

   * Widespread anaemia and underweight among mothers → low-birth weight babies → higher IMR.
   * Lack of adolescent nutrition focus.

5. **Weak Social Infrastructure**

   * Erratic electricity, unsafe drinking water, lack of connectivity, scarce ambulances.
   * Contributes to high burden of pneumonia, diarrhoea, sickle cell disease.

6. **Misclassification of Deaths**

   * Immediate cause (pneumonia) reported instead of underlying cause (malnutrition), leading to policy complacency.

7. **Cultural & Behavioural Factors**

   * Substance abuse in some households.
   * Low awareness of maternal and newborn care practices.

8. **Governance Deficits**

   * Poor monitoring of VCDCs, irregular supply of supplementary nutrition.
   * Weak accountability mechanisms.

---

#### **B. Impacts**

* **High Infant Mortality** despite three decades of interventions.
* **Undermining Tribal Rights** and deepening inequalities.
* **Economic costs** for families and State due to repeated illness and treatment.
* **Erosion of trust** in public institutions due to persistent neglect.
* **Stagnation in achieving SDG-2 (Zero Hunger)** and SDG-3 (Health & Wellbeing).

---

### **5. Way Forward**

#### **A. Strengthen Integrated Healthcare & Nutrition Delivery**

* Merge siloed departmental efforts: ICDS + NHM + Tribal Welfare → coordinated district-level action plans.
* Strengthen **nutrition rehabilitation centres**, ensure adequate staffing, and streamline referral pathways.

#### **B. Improve Healthcare Infrastructure in Tribal Regions**

* Upgrade PHCs/CHCs with 24×7 availability, oxygen facilities, and emergency care.
* Ensure ambulance services with GPS tracking.
* Strengthen telemedicine for remote hamlets.

#### **C. Solve Human Resource Shortages**

* Mandatory rural service for medical graduates.
* Provide housing, safety assurance, and rotational postings.
* Recruit local community-based workers (tribal youth) as health assistants.

#### **D. Address Intergenerational Malnutrition**

* Focus on adolescent girls’ nutrition through:

  * Weekly Iron and Folic Acid Supplementation (WIFS)
  * School-based nutrition counselling
  * Take-home rations and egg supplementation
* Strengthen antenatal care, maternal nutrition, and early breastfeeding practices.

#### **E. Community-Led Behavioural Change**

* ASHA/Anganwadi workers trained in SAM identification, counselling, and home visits.
* Use tribal leaders and local NGOs for awareness campaigns on hygiene, newborn care, nutrition, and substance misuse.

#### **F. Data, Monitoring & Accountability**

* Real-time use of **Poshan Tracker** for supply chain and growth monitoring.
* Independent audits of Anganwadi centres and VCDCs.
* Quarterly public reporting of malnutrition and IMR trends.
* Social audits with tribal community participation.

#### **G. Broader Development Measures**

* Improve roads, electricity, clean water, and connectivity — essential social determinants of health.
* Promote livelihood schemes and MGNREGA to reduce food insecurity.
