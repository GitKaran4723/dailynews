# Assam proposes jail term, heavy fines for polygamy
## **Assam Prohibition of Polygamy Bill, 2025**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

**What is Polygamy?**

* Polygamy refers to a person having more than one spouse at the same time.
* In India:

  * **Hindu Marriage Act (1955)** prohibits polygamy among Hindus.
  * **Special Marriage Act (1954)** also mandates monogamy.
  * **Muslim Personal Law** permits polygamy for men (up to four wives), though many Muslim-majority nations have already restricted or abolished the practice.
* States have the legislative competence to make laws on marriage under **Entry 5, Concurrent List**.

**Sixth Schedule Areas & Tribal Customary Laws**

* Certain tribal groups in Assam follow customary practices, including polygamy.
* Sixth Schedule gives autonomy to tribal areas; hence, the Bill **excludes** these areas and **does not apply to Scheduled Tribes under Article 342**, respecting customary laws.

---

### **2. The News**

* Assam CM **Himanta Biswa Sarma** tabled the **Assam Prohibition of Polygamy Bill, 2025** in the State Assembly.
* Key provisions:

  * **Polygamy criminalised**, punishable with **up to 7 years imprisonment + fine**.
  * If the second marriage is performed by **concealing the first marriage**, punishment extends to **10 years + heavy fine**.
  * **Repeat offenders** face double the punishment.
* The Bill applies to the **entire State except Sixth Schedule areas**, and excludes STs protected under Article 342.
* The Statement of Objects and Reasons says the Bill seeks to eliminate polygamy, protect women from exploitation, and “streamline society”.
* **Village heads, qazis, priests, parents, guardians**, and **anyone abetting polygamy** can be punished.

  * Failure to report polygamy → **up to 2 years jail** + **₹1 lakh fine**.
  * Priests/qazis who knowingly solemnise prohibited marriages → **₹1.5 lakh fine**.
* The Bill has **extra-territorial jurisdiction**, meaning non-residents marrying in contravention within Assam can be prosecuted.

---

### **3. Government Interventions & Related Initiatives**

**A. Precedents from Other Laws**

* **Indian Penal Code (Section 494, 495):** Already criminalises bigamy but often under-used due to procedural hurdles.
* **Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019:** Criminalised triple talaq — demonstrates growing legislative trend towards protecting Muslim women’s rights.
* **Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005:** Provides civil remedies.
* **Special Marriage Act:** Promotes monogamy across religions.

**B. Assam Government Steps**

* Assam has expressed intentions to implement a **Uniform Civil Code-like reform** gradually.
* A **panel** was earlier set up to examine the feasibility of banning polygamy and other practices considered discriminatory.

**C. Constitutional Provisions**

* **Article 25:** Freedom of religion is subject to public order, morality, and health, and to other Fundamental Rights (equality, dignity).
* **Article 14 & 15:** Provide basis to regulate personal law where women’s equality is threatened.
* **Concurrent List (Entry 5):** States can legislate on marriage, divorce, legitimacy, guardianship.

---

### **4. Mains Relevance**

#### **A. Issues & Challenges**

1. **Personal Law vs. Equality Debate**

   * The Bill touches on sensitive territory of reforming personal laws, particularly Muslim personal law.
   * Raises questions on whether the State can override religious practices when they conflict with gender justice.

2. **Overlap with Existing Laws**

   * Bigamy is already a crime under IPC; the Bill creates a **parallel criminal track**.
   * Could raise questions of redundancy vs. need for a more enforceable mechanism.

3. **Implementation Challenges**

   * Enforcement may require strong police machinery and community cooperation.
   * Criminalisation can push the practice underground, leaving women more vulnerable.

4. **Exemption for Tribal Customs**

   * Selective exclusion of STs may raise concerns of unequal application.
   * Also highlights tension between customary rights and gender justice.

5. **Possible Constitutional Challenges**

   * **Privacy (Article 21)**: State interference in marital affairs.
   * **Religious Freedom (Articles 25–26)**: Whether banning polygamy infringes upon Muslim personal law.
   * **Equality Arguments**: Supporters argue monogamy laws advance gender equality.

6. **Social Impact**

   * Could help women gain legal clarity on marital rights, maintenance, inheritance.
   * But may cause social backlash in conservative communities.

---

#### **B. Impacts**

**Positive Impacts**

* Protects women from exploitation, economic deprivation, and psychological harm.
* Aims to bring uniformity across marital laws (except for protected tribal customs).
* Strong punitive measures may deter concealment of second marriages.

**Negative or Unintended Impacts**

* Criminalisation may discourage reporting by women if they depend on the husband financially.
* Fear of arrest may cause desertion or abandonment without legal divorce.
* Community-level resistance can hinder effective implementation.

---

### **5. Way Forward**

#### **A. Ensure Gender-Sensitive Implementation**

* Establish special cells for women's rights.
* Provide protection, legal aid, and rehabilitation support for affected women.

#### **B. Strengthen Civil Remedies**

* Alongside criminalisation, strengthen:

  * Maintenance rights
  * Inheritance rights
  * Fast-track family courts
  * Protection under DV Act
* Combined civil & criminal remedies prevent misuse and support women.

#### **C. Broad-Based Consultations**

* Engage women’s groups, religious scholars, tribal leaders, and legal experts.
* Ensure reforms are participatory, not imposed.

#### **D. Harmonise Personal Laws Gradually**

* Move towards a framework that balances:

  * Gender justice
  * Cultural diversity
  * Constitutional morality
* Respect the autonomy of Sixth Schedule and ST communities while addressing gender issues sensitively.

#### **E. Awareness & Community Engagement**

* Counselling, marriage registration campaigns, and education on women’s rights.
* Use ASHA workers, Anganwadi workers, and local NGOs for outreach.

#### **F. Prevent Misuse**

* Include safeguards against false or malicious complaints.
* Establish independent oversight mechanisms.

# Losing the plot
## **Winter Smog, Airshed Governance & Delhi’s Protest Incident**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

**What is Air Quality Index (AQI)?**

* A numerical scale (0–500) indicating how polluted the air is.
* **AQI 400+ = “Severe”**, causing respiratory distress even in healthy individuals.

**Why is North India’s winter smog so severe?**

* Combination of:

  * Temperature inversion trapping pollutants
  * Low wind speed
  * High emissions from transport, industries, power plants
  * Biomass and crop residue burning
  * Construction dust
  * Household solid fuel usage
* The region forms a **single “airshed”**, meaning pollutants from Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, western UP, and even Pakistan accumulate in one atmospheric basin.

**Airshed Governance**

* An airshed is a geographic area where air pollutants are interlinked.
* Effective air quality management requires **coordinated, multi-state action**, not isolated city-level measures.

**Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM)**

* A statutory body (2021) created to manage air quality in the National Capital Region (NCR) and adjoining areas.
* Has powers for coordination, issuing directions, and imposing penalties.

---

### **2. The News**

* On **November 24**, Delhi Police confronted a **peaceful protest near India Gate** where citizens highlighted AQI levels nearing **400 (“severe”)**.
* The protest was met with **heavy police presence**, including the **Rapid Action Force (RAF)**, indicating the state's perception of the gathering as a law-and-order threat instead of a public concern.
* Delhi’s middle class — historically reliant on **private coping mechanisms** (air purifiers, sealed homes, winter vacations) — is now publicly expressing dissatisfaction.
* Air quality across **North India**, from **Islamabad to Bihar**, remains consistently poor, underscoring that the crisis is **regional**, not Delhi-specific.
* Long-term data (Air Quality Life Index) reveals unsafe air is now **normal** across India, and current governance frameworks are **insufficient**.
* Responses remain seasonal and reactive, instead of systemic and sustained.

---

### **3. Government Interventions & Institutional Mechanisms**

**A. Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM)**

* Created to overcome fragmented authority across ministries, States, and local bodies.
* Empowered to:

  * Direct emission control actions
  * Coordinate between States
  * Impose sanctions
  * Guide long-term strategies
* However, its interventions have not matched the scale of the crisis.

**B. Other Interventions**

* **GRAP (Graded Response Action Plan)** in Delhi–NCR for emergency pollution stages.
* **National Clean Air Programme (NCAP)** aims for 40% reduction in PM levels by 2026 and city-specific action plans.
* **Faster Adoption of Electric Vehicles (FAME)** for transport emissions.
* **Crop residue management schemes** in Punjab, Haryana, UP.
* **Afforestation programmes**, dust control norms, retrofitting of industry.

**C. Judicial Measures**

* Supreme Court interventions on stubble burning, firecrackers, and industrial emissions.

**D. Weaknesses in Current Approach**

* Highly fragmented authority
* Over-reliance on short-term emergency measures
* Underfunded monitoring systems
* Weak enforcement of polluting industries and construction sectors
* Lack of credible alternatives for farmers

---

### **4. Mains Relevance**

#### **A. Issues & Challenges**

1. **Fragmented Governance**

   * Air pollution involves multiple governments, ministries, regulators, and municipal bodies → no single accountable authority.

2. **Seasonal Crisis Mindset**

   * Treating pollution as a winter emergency prevents long-term structural solutions.

3. **Political Sensitivity**

   * Public protests often met with policing rather than dialogue.
   * Environmental concerns become entangled in political blame games between States.

4. **Sectoral Emission Sources**

   * Power plants, industrial clusters, thermal stations
   * Vehicular emissions
   * Construction dust
   * Crop burning
   * Household fuel use
   * Each sector governed by different rules & agencies → coordination failure.

5. **Weak Enforcement**

   * Industries often violate stack norms; construction rules are poorly monitored.
   * CAQM has authority but lacks robust infrastructure and political backing for strict enforcement.

6. **Data Gaps & Limited Transparency**

   * Inconsistent monitoring outside metros.
   * Rural and small-town pollution remains invisible.

7. **Lack of Long-term Political Vision**

   * Pollution control requires unpopular decisions (plant retirements, fuel transitions), demanding political courage.

---

#### **B. Impacts**

**Health Impact**

* Shortened life expectancy across the Indo-Gangetic Plain.
* Rise in cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.
* Burden on public health systems.

**Economic Impact**

* Lost productivity, higher healthcare costs.
* Disruption of transport, construction, and tourism.

**Social Impact**

* Middle class demanding accountability reflects shifting public consciousness.
* Heavy-handed response erodes trust in governance.

**Environmental Impact**

* Persistent PM2.5 and PM10 levels degrade the entire airshed ecosystem.

---

### **5. Way Forward**

#### **A. Shift to Airshed-Based Governance**

* Establish **permanent multi-state airshed authorities** with binding powers.
* Empower CAQM further to enforce long-term actions, not only emergency curbs.

#### **B. Strengthen Sectoral Plans**

* **Power Sector:**

  * Retire old thermal plants; ensure FGD (Flue Gas Desulphurisation) compliance.
* **Industry:**

  * Strict stack monitoring; continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS).
* **Transport:**

  * Expand EV infrastructure; congestion pricing; strengthen public transport.
* **Construction:**

  * Strong penalties for dust violations; ensure real-time monitoring.
* **Agriculture:**

  * Subsidised happy seeders, crop diversification; remunerative alternatives to residue burning.

#### **C. Reject Technical Quick Fixes**

* Smog towers, anti-smog guns, water sprinkling → low-impact, high-cost.
* Avoid symbolic gestures that do not reduce emissions.

#### **D. Transparency & Accountability**

* Public dashboards with real-time emissions data for power plants, factories, and construction sites.
* Independent audits of pollution-control compliance.

#### **E. Deepen Citizen Engagement**

* Promote public consultations and participation rather than criminalising protests.
* Air quality governance must treat citizens as partners, not threats.

#### **F. Long-Term Institutional Reform**

* Strengthen NCAP targets; move towards legally enforceable PM2.5 standards.
* Create inter-State compacts similar to river basin authorities.

# Trump-MbS summit — $1 trillion among friends
## **U.S.–Saudi Relations Reset under Trump 2.0: History, New Dynamics & Impact on India**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

**Origins of the U.S.–Saudi Partnership**

* The alliance began in **1945**, long before the UN or NATO existed.
* It was forged through a secret “**oil-for-security**” pact between U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and King Abdul Aziz aboard the USS *Quincy*.
* The understanding:

  * **Saudi Arabia supplies oil**
  * **The U.S. guarantees security**
* Initially designed for 60 years, it was renewed in **2005**.

**What is a Major Non-NATO Ally?**

* A U.S. designation providing military, technological, and defence cooperation benefits, without being part of NATO.
* Saudi Arabia now holds this status under Trump’s second term.

**Why Are U.S.–Saudi ties so important globally?**

* Saudi Arabia is the Arab world’s largest economy and a leading oil exporter.
* The U.S. remains the world’s strongest military power with strategic presence in West Asia.
* Cooperation influences oil markets, Middle East geopolitics, and global security.

---

### **2. The News**

* A U.S.–Saudi Summit in Washington showcased a **dramatic revival** of bilateral ties under **President Donald Trump** (second term) and Crown Prince **Mohammed bin Salman (MbS)**.

* This partnership is being **reset** to newer domains: AI, defence, nuclear energy, global oil coordination.

* The Summit included:

  * $142 **billion defence deal**
  * $270 **billion investment forum agreements**
  * Commitment by Saudi Arabia to raise U.S. investments to **$1 trillion**
  * **Strategic Defence Agreement**, formally elevating Saudi Arabia to *major non-NATO ally* status
  * Cooperation on **civil nuclear energy** and **AI chips**

* The meeting avoided controversial topics (Israel, oil glut, Iran) and issued **no formal communiqué**, signalling political sensitivity and ongoing negotiations.

---

### **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives (Diplomatic Context)**

**A. U.S. Foreign Policy Shifts**

* Trump 2.0 is prioritising transactional diplomacy, economic deals, and reasserting American influence in West Asia.
* Rolling back earlier human rights criticism of MbS.
* Lifting sanctions on Syria’s new regime and intervening in Sudan talks.

**B. Saudi Vision 2030**

* A massive economic diversification plan led by MbS — investments in AI, green energy, megacities (NEOM), defence autonomy.
* Heavy reliance on foreign investments (U.S., China, India).

**C. U.S. Regional Strategy**

* Pushback against China–Russia influence.
* Attempts to maintain “Pax Americana”.
* Need to coordinate oil markets through sanctions (Iran, Venezuela, Russian oil majors).

**D. Earlier Strains in Ties**

* 1973 oil embargo
* Missile deal with China (1980s)
* Yemen War and reduced U.S. arms supplies
* Jamal Khashoggi episode (2018)
* Biden-era distancing from MbS
* China’s diplomatic role in Riyadh–Tehran rapprochement (2022)

---

### **4. Mains Relevance**

#### **A. Issues & Challenges in the New U.S.–Saudi Relationship**

1. **Shift from Oil-for-Security to Economic–Strategic Compact**

   * Defence tech, AI, nuclear energy now central to ties.
   * Oil still matters but no longer the sole pillar.

2. **Transactional Diplomacy Risks**

   * Deals may be inflated or incomplete (“truthful hyperbole”).
   * Lack of final communiqué indicates unresolved faultlines.

3. **Regional Flashpoints**

   * Gaza conflict, Israel–Saudi normalisation, Iran’s nuclear ambitions, and Yemen insurgency all complicate the picture.

4. **Saudi Arabia’s New Assertiveness**

   * Active diplomacy in Syria, Sudan, Iran talks.
   * Rising ambitions under MbS, who could dominate regional politics for decades.

5. **Deepening U.S.–Saudi Interdependence**

   * Oil price coordination to avoid supply gluts.
   * Countering China and Russia in West Asia.
   * Strategic alignment despite past frictions.

---

#### **B. Impact on India**

1. **Possible U.S. Arms Flow to Pakistan**

   * Riyadh–Islamabad mutual defence treaty (2025) could bring advanced U.S. systems to Pakistan via Saudi Arabia.

2. **Oil Price Stability**

   * India prefers low prices but benefits from predictable, moderate markets.
   * Coordination between U.S.–Saudi sanctions may limit global supply surges.

3. **Economic & Investment Opportunities**

   * Saudi Vision 2030: AI, data centres, infrastructure could open avenues for Indian firms.
   * Larger Saudi investments in the U.S. reduce China’s foothold → more space for India.

4. **Strategic Corridor Projects**

   * India–Middle East–Europe Economic Corridor (IMEEC) depends heavily on Saudi participation.
   * Improved U.S.–Saudi ties may accelerate its implementation.

5. **Geopolitical Leverage**

   * India can balance relations with the U.S., Gulf, and Israel.
   * Washington’s pragmatic stance (economic > human rights concerns) allows India space for its own realpolitik approach.

---

### **5. Way Forward**

#### **A. For Global Stability**

* Encourage U.S.–Saudi cooperation on regional peace (Sudan, Syria, Iran).
* Promote balanced oil market governance.
* Ensure multipolar stability in West Asia without zero-sum rivalries.

#### **B. For India**

* Accelerate CEPA negotiations with Saudi Arabia.
* Deepen energy partnerships (including green hydrogen).
* Strengthen diaspora safety and labour cooperation.
* Position Indian IT/AI firms to participate in Saudi future-tech projects.
* Engage diplomatically to ensure weapons transfers do not indirectly benefit Pakistan.

#### **C. Broader Governance Vision**

* The U.S.–Saudi alliance must transition toward **long-term, institutionalised cooperation** in defence, emerging tech, climate adaptation, and economic diversification.
* Avoid over-reliance on personalities (Trump–MbS chemistry) to prevent future volatility.

# A landmark law in 2013, it needs a spine in 2025
## **POSH Act, ICC Proceedings & the Chandigarh Precedent**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

**What is the POSH Act (2013)?**

* The **Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013** was enacted after the Supreme Court’s *Vishaka* guidelines (1997).
* It mandates:

  * **Internal Committee (IC/ICC)** in every institution/employer with >10 employees
  * Time-bound inquiry
  * Protection of complainants
  * Preventive training, awareness and sensitisation

**Definition of Sexual Harassment:**

* Unwelcome conduct (physical, verbal, non-verbal), quid pro quo, hostile work environment, and any sexually coloured behaviour.

**Why Educational Institutions Are Vulnerable:**

* Power asymmetry between teachers and students
* Academic hierarchy, trust-based mentoring
* Younger complainants, delayed recognition
* Reputation-based pressure discouraging complaints

---

### **2. The News**

* In Chandigarh, a **college professor was dismissed** after the ICC found allegations of sexual harassment **proven** (complaint filed on 12 September 2024).
* The case is notable because **successful action under the POSH Act remains rare**, particularly in universities.
* Instead of symbolising routine justice, the incident exposed **systemic issues**: low conviction, weak processes, delays, gaps in law, digital evidence challenges, and trauma-inducing procedures.
* The case has reopened debates on how the POSH Act needs **substantive reform** for educational settings.

---

### **3. Government Interventions & Institutional Framework**

**A. POSH Act, 2013 — Key Provisions**

* Mandatory ICC; External Member required
* 90-day limitation for complaints
* 90-day inquiry timeline
* Protection against victimisation
* Employer obligation to implement preventive measures

**B. UGC & Higher Education Regulations**

* **UGC (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal of Sexual Harassment of Women Employees and Students in Higher Educational Institutions) Regulations, 2015**
* Mandatory Internal Complaints Committee in all higher education institutions
* Expanded duties:

  * Gender sensitisation
  * Orientation for ICC members
  * Counsellors & support cells

**C. Digital Evidence Rules**

* Indian Evidence Act recognises electronic evidence under Sec. 65A & 65B.
* But ICCs often lack technical training to handle:

  * Self-destructing messages
  * Screenshots
  * Vanishing media
  * Encrypted chats

**D. Safeguards**

* The Act penalises malicious complaints, but misuse is rare and fear of counter-action deters genuine victims.

**E. Limitations**

* No provision for:

  * Inter-institutional complaints
  * Emotional or manipulative coercion
  * Informed consent violations
  * Delay beyond 3 months
  * Pattern-based evidence assessment

---

### **4. Mains Relevance**

#### **A. Issues & Challenges**

1. **Flawed Concept of Consent**

   * The Act addresses “consent” but ignores “informed consent”.
   * In academia, consent may be compromised by:

     * Mentorship dependence
     * Academic evaluation
     * Future career references
     * Age and authority gaps
   * Emotional manipulation can render initial “consent” non-consensual.

2. **Emotional & Psychological Harassment Not Covered**

   * Emotional blackmail, manipulation, toxic relationships → not recognised legally.
   * Harassers exploit grey zones knowing visible evidence is scarce.

3. **Rigid Limitation Period (3 months)**

   * Survivors often require time to name/understand the violation.
   * Harassment patterns come to light much later.
   * The rule disproportionately harms students vulnerable to power dynamics.

4. **Terminology Dilutes Gravity**

   * Using “respondent” instead of “accused” trivialises the offence.
   * Creates a false equivalence, undermining seriousness.

5. **Burden of Proof on Survivors**

   * ICCs often seek direct evidence for pattern-based misconduct.
   * Lack of provisions for anonymous feedback, corroborative testimony.

6. **No Mechanism for Inter-Institutional Offenders**

   * Visiting faculty, conference networks → repeat offenders move freely.
   * Institutions lack a coordinated reporting system.

7. **Digital Evidence Gaps**

   * ICCs ill-equipped to understand encrypted or disappearing media.
   * Perpetrators use tech-savvy tactics to avoid leaving traces.

8. **Chilling Effect of “Malicious Complaint” Clause**

   * Intended safeguard becomes a threat; survivors fear counter-allegations.

9. **Institutional Hesitancy & Retaliation Risks**

   * Universities aim to avoid controversy.
   * Complainants face isolation, delays, pressure to compromise.

---

#### **B. Impacts**

* **Low conviction rates** discourage reporting.
* **Psychological trauma** increases when procedures feel hostile.
* **Repeat harassment** becomes possible due to mobility of offenders between institutions.
* **Erosion of trust** in ICCs and institutional mechanisms.
* **Dependence on informal networks (“whisper circles”)** persists, bypassing legal structures.

---

### **5. Way Forward**

#### **A. Reform the Law Substantively**

1. Expand definitions to include:

   * Emotional coercion
   * Manipulative relationships
   * Informed consent violations
   * Digital harassment
2. Extend limitation period beyond 3 months or allow exceptions for delayed reporting.

#### **B. Strengthen Investigative Tools**

* Allow pattern-based assessment, corroborative testimonies, and behavioural evidence.
* Provide ICCs with:

  * Legal training
  * Trauma-informed methods
  * Digital forensics support

#### **C. Clarify Inter-Institutional Mechanisms**

* Central registry of offenders (with necessary safeguards).
* Cross-institutional cooperation for inquiries involving visiting faculty.

#### **D. Protect Survivors Better**

* Ban or limit counter-charges except where malice is proved beyond doubt.
* Provide counselling, academic accommodations, and safety plans.

#### **E. Institutional Accountability**

* Penalise institutions for:

  * Delays
  * Bias
  * Lack of training
  * Non-implementation of UGC POSH regulations.
* Conduct regular audits by external gender-sensitisation experts.

#### **F. Update Digital Protocols**

* Clear guidelines for:

  * Preserving chats
  * Authenticating screenshots
  * Handling ephemeral messages
* Mandatory tech training for ICCs.

#### **G. Cultural Shift**

* Mandatory gender-sensitisation workshops.
* Encourage open dialogue, reduce stigma.
* Build trust in formal mechanisms so informal “warning networks” aren’t the only safety system.

# Decoding personality rights in the age of AI
## **AI Deepfakes, Personality Rights & the Bachchan Case: Legal-Ethical Analysis**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

**Personality Rights**

* Personality rights allow individuals to control the commercial or public use of their identity — including **name, image, likeness, voice, appearance, gestures, and other identifying attributes**.
* They stem from two foundations:

  * **Privacy/Dignity** (protecting autonomy and personhood)
  * **Property/Commercial Value** (preventing unauthorised commercial exploitation)

**Deepfakes & Generative AI**

* Deepfakes use AI to create hyper-realistic but fabricated videos or audio.
* Risks include:

  * Sexualised content
  * Reputational harm
  * Political disinformation
  * Financial fraud
  * Psychological manipulation
  * “Digital kidnapping” of identity (image, voice, persona)

**Why Actors Turn to Courts**

* Celebrities face higher risks since their identities have monetary value.
* Courts must balance **free speech**, **innovation**, and **identity protection**.

---

### **2. The News**

* Actors **Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Abhishek Bachchan** filed a lawsuit in the Delhi High Court against **Google and YouTube**.
* They argue that AI-generated obscene/fake videos:

  * Infringe their **personality rights**
  * Cause **financial** and **reputational damage**
  * Exploit their identity for engagement
* They seek:

  * Compensation
  * Removal of deepfake videos
  * **Safeguards preventing such content being used to train future AI models**
* The case signals the next major legal frontier: **AI misuse of identity**, not just copyright or privacy.

---

### **3. Government Interventions & Legal Frameworks**

#### **A. India’s Hybrid Framework**

* No codified personality rights law.
* Rights derived from **Article 21 (privacy, dignity)** — affirmed in *Puttaswamy* (2017).
* Courts have expanded personality rights case-by-case:

  * **Amitabh Bachchan v. Rajat Nagi (2022)** – persona protected from commercial exploitation
  * **Anil Kapoor v. Simply Life India (2023)** – AI deepfakes restricted
  * **Arijit Singh v. Codible Ventures (2024)** – voice protected from AI replication
* **IT Act, 2000 & Intermediary Guidelines (2024)**:

  * Cover impersonation and deepfakes; mandate platform takedowns.
  * Enforcement weak due to anonymity and cross-border platforms.
* **2024 Government Deepfake Advisory**

  * Calls for watermarking and reporting obligations.

**Gaps**

* No statutory definition of personality rights.
* No rules for AI-training datasets or model accountability.
* No uniform law for cross-platform deepfake circulation.

---

#### **B. Global Legal Approaches**

**United States**

* Follows **property-based “right of publicity”**
* *Haelan Labs v. Topps* (1953) established monetisation of identity
* State laws vary; key reforms include:

  * **Tennessee’s ELVIS Act (2024)** — bans unauthorised AI voice/image reproduction
  * Lawsuits against Character.AI over harmful chatbot behaviours
* First Amendment defences are increasingly being rejected in AI harm cases.

**European Union**

* **GDPR (2016)** – consent required for processing personal/biometric data
* **EU AI Act (2024)** – deepfakes labelled high-risk; mandatory transparency and labelling
* Emphasises dignity and autonomy over commercial rights.

**China**

* Tightest regulatory model.
* 2024 Beijing Internet Court ruled synthetic voices must never deceive users.
* Damages awarded to voice actors for AI replicas — recognises voice/persona as protected identity.

**Global Challenge**

* AI systems trained on global datasets → jurisdictional boundaries meaningless.
* Lack of harmonised rules incentivises “forum shopping” by platforms.

---

### **4. Mains Relevance**

#### **A. Issues & Challenges**

1. **AI Erodes the Boundary Between Reality and Fabrication**

   * Deepfakes can produce credible, non-consensual sexual imagery.
   * Accelerates reputational damage and misinformation.

2. **Lack of Codified Personality Rights in India**

   * Courts rely on fragmented privacy + IP-based reasoning.
   * Leads to inconsistent standards.

3. **Weak Platform Accountability**

   * Intermediaries claim “safe harbour”.
   * Takedown mechanisms reactive, not preventive.

4. **AI Training Data Ambiguity**

   * How to prevent a model from being trained on private or non-consensual content?
   * Current laws silent on dataset governance.

5. **Difficulty Proving Harm**

   * Monetising identity (brand value) vs. emotional harm (dignity).
   * Deepfakes spread faster than courts can act.

6. **Ethical Challenges**

   * AI recreations of deceased artists.
   * Style/persona-based training without consent.
   * Psychological manipulation by AI chatbots.

7. **Transnational Nature of Digital Harms**

   * Content hosted abroad
   * Model developers in multiple jurisdictions
   * Enforcement becomes nearly impossible

8. **Innovation vs. Regulation**

   * Over-regulation risks stifling creativity.
   * Under-regulation leads to exploitation and identity theft.

---

#### **B. Impacts**

* **On Privacy & Dignity:** Deepfakes weaponise identity, especially against women.
* **On Economy:** Celebrity brand equity and endorsement markets impacted.
* **On Trust:** Public unable to distinguish real from fake → erosion of digital credibility.
* **On Democracy:** Deepfake-driven disinformation can influence elections.
* **On Legal Order:** Courts increasingly burdened with takedown petitions.

---

### **5. Way Forward**

#### **A. Codify Personality Rights in India**

* New law defining:

  * Name, image, likeness, voice
  * Digital identifiers (mannerisms, style, persona)
  * Rights over AI-generated use
  * Rules for transferability, licensing, inheritance

#### **B. Regulate AI Training Data**

* Mandatory consent for using identity-based data.
* Dataset audits and transparency.
* Explicit prohibition on training AI models on non-consensual content.

#### **C. Mandatory Watermarking & Traceability**

* Invisible+visible watermarking in all AI-generated media.
* Blockchain-based provenance systems to track the origin of deepfakes.

#### **D. Strong Intermediary Liability**

* “Duty of care” for platforms hosting deepfakes.
* Strict takedown windows (24 hours).
* Penalties for repeat inaction.
* Algorithmic detection obligations.

#### **E. Criminal Penalties for Non-Consensual Deepfakes**

* Especially for sexualised content.
* Similar to provisions in U.K. and U.S. states.

#### **F. Global Cooperation**

* Align with UNESCO AI Ethics Guidelines.

# ‘Rupee is Asia’s worst performing currency’
## **Rupee Depreciation in 2025: Causes, Context & Implications**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

**What is Rupee Depreciation?**

* When the **Indian Rupee (INR)** buys fewer U.S. Dollars (USD), it is said to have depreciated.
* Example: If INR moves from **82 → 89 per USD**, the rupee has lost value.
* Depreciation makes **imports costlier** and **exports more competitive**, though benefits depend on structural factors.

**Key Drivers of Currency Movements**

* **Capital flows** (FIIs/FPI inflows or outflows)
* **Current account balance**
* **Global dollar strength**
* **Geopolitical tensions**
* **Interest rate differentials**
* **Commodity prices (oil, gold)**
* **Central bank interventions**

**CYTD (Calendar Year-to-Date)** shows currency performance from January 1 to current date.

---

### **2. The News**

* The **Indian Rupee** has depreciated **4.3%** against the U.S. Dollar in 2025 (Jan–Dec), making it **Asia’s worst-performing currency** this year.
* Analysts warn the INR could slide to **₹90 per USD** if the **India–U.S. trade deal** fails.
* On **November 21, 2025**, the INR hit a historic low of **₹89.66**, breaking RBI’s defence zone of 88.8.
* It has recovered slightly to **₹89.22**.
* The depreciation is occurring despite a **benign current account**, mainly due to:

  * **Capital outflows**
  * **Strong U.S. Dollar**
  * **U.S. tariffs on India**
  * **High gold prices and record gold imports**
  * **Wider merchandise trade deficit**
* Other Asian currencies have performed better:

  * **IDR (Indonesia):** –2.9%
  * **PHP (Philippines):** –1.3%
  * **CNY:** Appreciated due to Chinese central bank interventions.
* India faces **twin external shocks**:

  * **Tariffs imposed by the Trump administration**
  * **High precious metal prices**

---

### **3. Government Interventions & Economic Mechanisms**

**A. Monetary Policy (RBI Responses)**

* RBI has been defending the rupee around the **88.8** levels by selling dollars from forex reserves.
* Using instruments such as:

  * Spot market interventions
  * Forward market operations
  * Liquidity tightening to control speculative pressure

**B. Trade & Tariff Negotiations**

* Negotiations with the U.S. to reverse or dilute the **50% tariffs** imposed by the Trump administration.
* Tariff hikes led to a **record $41.7 billion trade deficit** in October 2025.

**C. Gold Import Management**

* High gold prices have driven a **200% surge in gold demand**, spiking imports to **$14.72 billion in October**.
* Government responses may include:

  * Increasing import duties
  * Encouraging gold monetisation schemes
  * Promoting digital gold
  * Regulating ETFs

**D. Industrial & Export Support**

* Credit incentives for exporters
* PLI schemes for boosting competitiveness
* Market diversification (Africa, Latin America, ASEAN)

**E. Coordination with Fiscal Policy**

* Measures to support investor confidence:

  * Stable tax regimes
  * Predictable FDI/FPI policies
  * Reducing regulatory uncertainty

**F. External Sector Management**

* Encouraging NRI deposits when rupee is weak
* Bilateral swaps (e.g., with UAE or Japan)
* Maintaining high forex reserves (~$640+ billion)

---

### **4. Mains Relevance**

#### **A. Issues & Challenges**

1. **Strong U.S. Dollar Cycle**

   * Fed’s tight monetary policy strengthens USD globally → INR weakens despite domestic fundamentals.

2. **Capital Outflows**

   * FPIs pulling money due to U.S. rate hikes and global uncertainty.
   * Rupee more sensitive to capital flows than trade flows.

3. **U.S. Tariffs Impacting Exports**

   * Trump administration’s **50% tariff** severely hit Indian exports → largest-ever monthly trade deficit.

4. **Gold Import Surge**

   * A cultural and investment-driven spike in gold buying strains forex.
   * Gold is India’s second-largest import after crude oil.

5. **Comparative Weakness vs Asian Peers**

   * CNY supported by PBOC interventions.
   * IDR & PHP less impacted due to current account surplus/stronger flows.
   * Structurally weak currency comparisons (JPY, KRW) show INR is not alone.

6. **Geo-economic & Geopolitical Pressures**

   * Ongoing conflicts (Middle East, Ukraine) pushing up commodity prices.
   * Supply chain realignment affecting emerging markets.

7. **Speculative Pressures**

   * Traders betting on rupee crossing **₹90** unless major policy actions occur.

---

#### **B. Impacts on India**

**Economic Impacts**

* Costlier imports (oil, gold, electronics)
* Input cost surge → inflationary pressures
* Higher interest burden on external debt
* Pressure on current account deficit

**Sectoral Impacts**

* Benefit for IT, pharma, exporters (limited due to tariffs)
* Higher cost for manufacturing reliant on imported inputs

**Social Impacts**

* Inflation affects household budgets
* Costlier fuel → transport and food inflation

**Global Perception**

* Depreciating currency may deter foreign investment
* Signals external vulnerabilities despite strong growth

---

### **5. Way Forward**

#### **A. Stabilise External Sector**

* Diversify export markets beyond U.S.
* Strengthen local supply chains and reduce import dependency
* Accelerate FTAs with EU, GCC, UK, Canada

#### **B. Negotiate Tariff Relief**

* Prioritise resolution of U.S. tariff dispute
* Use diplomatic leverage to restore zero/low tariffs in key sectors

#### **C. Manage Gold Imports**

* Strengthen gold monetisation and gold savings schemes
* Encourage regulated digital gold
* Expand jewellery hallmarking to discourage physical hoarding

#### **D. Enhance Capital Inflows**

* Make FDI regimes more predictable

* Develop deeper corporate bond markets

#### **E. Strengthen Domestic Fundamentals**

* Control inflation
* Maintain fiscal prudence
* Incentivise domestic manufacturing (PLI, logistics reforms)

#### **F. Technical & Strategic Measures**

* Encourage rupee invoicing in trade

# What does the draft Seeds Bill entail?
## **Draft Seeds Bill, 2025: Reforming Seed Regulation & Debates on Farmers’ Rights**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

**Why regulate seeds?**

* Seeds determine **crop productivity, food security, and farm incomes**.
* Poor-quality, spurious, or adulterated seeds lead to crop failure and farmer distress.
* India’s existing laws — **Seeds Act, 1966** and **Seeds (Control) Order, 1983** — are outdated.
* Advancements in biotechnology, hybrids, transgenics, and seed processing require a **modern regulatory framework**.

**Major institutions involved**:

* Seed producers
* Dealers
* Distributors
* Farmers (as both users & informal seed suppliers)
* Seed testing laboratories
* Certification agencies

**Policy context**

* India has surplus seed availability (508.60 lakh quintals vs requirement of 462.31 lakh quintals in 2023–24).
* Industry demands modernization; several farmer groups fear **corporatisation** and **loss of seed sovereignty**.

---

### **2. The News**

* On **November 12**, the Union Agriculture Ministry released the **Draft Seeds Bill, 2025**, inviting comments until December 11.
* The Bill aims to:

  * Update seed regulation
  * Reduce compliance burden
  * Improve seed quality standards
  * Strengthen penalties
  * Introduce transparent accreditation systems
* Strong reactions:

  * **Seed industry** welcomes modernisation.
  * **Farm unions (Samyukt Kisan Morcha, AIKS)** oppose, alleging anti-farmer provisions and corporate dominance.

---

### **3. Government Interventions & Key Provisions of the Draft Bill**

  * Sets standards on germination, purity, traits, seed health.
  * Advises the Union government.
* **State Seed Committees (15 members):**

  * Registers seed producers, dealers, nurseries, processing units.

#### **C. Seed Registration & Accreditation**

* Mandatory registration for:

  * Seed processing units
  * Producers, dealers, distributors
* Creation of a **Central Accreditation System** to promote ease of doing business for companies operating in multiple States.

#### **D. National Register & Field Trials**

* “Registrar” office to maintain a **National Register of Seed Varieties**.
* Detailed procedure for **Value for Cultivation and Use (VCU)** field trials.

#### **E. Seed Testing & Enforcement**

---

### **4. Mains Relevance**

#### **A. Issues & Challenges**

1. **Corporate vs Farmer Interests**

   * Farmers fear corporates may dominate seeds through high prices and branding control.
   * Predatory pricing concerns as seen earlier in Bt cotton debates.

2. **Seed Sovereignty & Biodiversity**

   * India’s traditional variety system and informal seed networks may weaken.
   * Risk of conflict with PPV&FRA 2001 protections.
   * Potential dilution of farmers’ rights under international biodiversity conventions.

3. **Centralisation of Authority**

   * Strong Central structures may sideline State-level agricultural diversity.
   * Farmers argue this tilts power toward large seed companies.

4. **Registration Burden**

   * Though eased, mandatory registration of seed processors and dealers can increase costs.
   * Small and rural seed processors may struggle.

5. **Quality Standards**

   * Higher standards are good for farmers but may push small-scale local seed systems out of formal markets.

6. **Legal Penalties**

   * Increased penalties may disproportionately affect small suppliers if rules interpreted rigidly.

---

#### **B. Impacts**

**For Farmers**

* Better access to quality seed, reducing crop failure risks.
* But risk of rising seed prices and reduced autonomy.

**For Seed Industry**

* Clearer norms, stronger IP protections, and easier interstate operations.
