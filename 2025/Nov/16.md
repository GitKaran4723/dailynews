# Where does India stand in tackling TB?
## **WHO Global Tuberculosis Report 2025: India’s Position, Challenges, and Global Context**

---

## **1. Basic Understanding**

### **What is Tuberculosis (TB)?**

TB is a contagious bacterial disease caused by *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, primarily affecting the lungs but capable of spreading to other organs. It is airborne, making crowded and poorly ventilated areas high-risk zones.

### **Key Concepts**

* **Incidence:** New TB cases each year per lakh population
* **Prevalence:** Total ongoing TB infections
* **Drug-Resistant TB (MDR/RR-TB):** TB resistant to the standard first-line drugs (isoniazid and/or rifampicin)
* **Treatment Coverage:** Proportion of TB patients receiving proper treatment
* **Elimination Target:** India aimed to eliminate TB by 2025 (i.e., reduce incidence to less than 1 case per lakh population)

---

## **2. The News**

The **WHO Global TB Report 2025** shows that TB continues to be one of the world’s deadliest infectious diseases:

* **1.07 crore people affected globally in 2024**
* **12 lakh deaths worldwide**

TB remains concentrated in 30 high-burden countries.

### **Countries with the Heaviest Burden**

According to WHO’s 2024 data:

* **India — 25% of global TB cases (highest)**
* Indonesia — 10%
* Philippines — 6.8%
* China — 6.5%
* Pakistan — 6.3%
* Nigeria — 4.8%
* DR Congo — 3.9%
* Bangladesh — 3.6%

These eight nations alone account for nearly **70% of global TB cases**.

WHO notes that while global progress has been made, **funding gaps and weak access to care** continue to threaten gains.

# Rare dolphin-fisher kinship in Ashtamudi lake to be studied
## **Human–Dolphin Cooperative Fishing in Ashtamudi Lake: A Unique Ecological and Cultural Phenomenon**

---

## **1. Basic Understanding**

### **What is Cooperative Fishing?**

Cooperative fishing between humans and wildlife refers to rare situations where both species coordinate their behaviour to secure mutual benefits. Classic global examples include:

* Brazil’s bottlenose dolphins helping fishers catch mullet
* Human–honeyguide cooperation in Africa
* Orcas helping whalers in Australia (historically)

### **The Ashtamudi Lake Case (Kerala)**

In Kerala’s **Ashtamudi lake**, artisanal fishers work with **Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa plumbea)** in a unique, naturally evolved partnership.

### **How It Works**

* Dolphins herd schools of fish toward shallow waters.
* They give a **clear signal**—tail slap, roll, or sudden dive.
* Fishers **immediately cast nets** in the indicated direction.
* Dolphins feed on the scattered fish while fishers get a full net.

This is an example of **mutualism**: both species benefit.

---

## **2. The News**

The University of Kerala has launched an **international collaborative research project (2024–2028)** to study this amazing inter-species behaviour.

### **Key Points from the Report**

* Researchers from **the U.S., Brazil, Australia, and India** are involved.
* Funded by the **National Geographic Society**.
* Coordinated globally by **Oregon State University**.
* India’s principal investigator: **Prof. A. Biju Kumar** (University of Kerala).
* The study titled **“The Ecology and Evolution of Cultural and Cooperative Behaviour among Dolphins and Humans”** seeks to uncover:

  * Mechanisms of cooperation
  * Communication cues
  * Evolution of cultural behaviour
  * Impact of human practices on dolphin ecology

### **Methodology**

* Strictly **non-invasive**
* Uses:

  * Photo–video documentation
  * Behavioural observation
  * Interviews with local fishers

No dolphins will be captured or handled.

---

## **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

Though the cooperative fishing project itself is academic, several national and state-level frameworks support conservation and sustainable use of aquatic biodiversity.

### **A. Legal Protections**

* **Wildlife Protection Act, 1972**

  * Dolphins are protected under Schedule I.

# Iran looks to BRICS countries to use cryptos to help it bypass sanctions
## **Iran’s Push to Use Cryptocurrencies for Trade With BRICS: Context, Challenges, and Global Implications**

---

## **1. Basic Understanding**

### **What Are Economic Sanctions?**

Sanctions are economic and financial penalties imposed by countries or international bodies to influence a country’s policies.
Iran has faced:

* **U.S. sanctions since 1979**, intensifying over time
* **UN & EU sanctions** related to its nuclear programme
* **“Snapback” sanctions in 2025** by France, UK, Germany over uranium enrichment

### **Impact on Iran**

* Severely restricted access to international banking
* **Blocked from SWIFT**, the global payment messaging system
* High difficulty in making cross-border payments
* Heavy dependence on informal or alternative trade channels

### **Role of Cryptocurrencies**

Cryptocurrencies are **decentralised digital currencies**, not controlled by any state or central bank.

Potential for Iran:

* Conduct trade outside U.S.-controlled financial systems
* Avoid dollar-dominated transactions
* Reduce visibility of cross-border payments
* Build “alternative rails” for international finance

---

## **2. The News**

At Iran’s **deBlock Summit 2025**, top Iranian leaders—especially Parliament Speaker **Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf**—announced their intention to:

* Use **cryptocurrencies** to pay for trade
* Enable transactions with **India** and **BRICS nations**
* Promote **de-dollarisation**
* Build Iran into a **regional blockchain hub**

This comes after the 2025 “snapback sanctions” reimposed restrictions on Iran’s financial system.

### **Key Announcements**

* Iran wants to develop:

  * Blockchain infrastructure
  * Crypto-based trade settlement mechanisms
  * Smart contracts for transparent trade agreements
* Iran declared readiness to work with:

  * Academics
  * Researchers
  * Private sector and tech companies

### **Link With BRICS**

BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa + newer members) has been discussing:

* Reducing reliance on the dollar
* Promoting local-currency trade
* Creating digital payment infrastructure

However, **India has publicly clarified**:
**“De-dollarisation is not part of India’s financial agenda.”**
— MEA spokesperson, August 2025

Thus, Iranian enthusiasm does not necessarily translate into Indian participation.

---

## **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

### **Iran’s Regulatory Landscape**

* **Central Bank of Iran** is the sole crypto regulator
* Key policies:

  * Crypto trading heavily restricted
  * Rial-to-crypto conversions blocked
  * Crypto mining allowed but under scrutiny
  * AML (Anti-Money Laundering) council previously banned crypto
* Regulatory inconsistencies create confusion and risk for businesses

### **BRICS Context**

* Many BRICS nations explore **CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies)**
* China is piloting the **digital yuan**
* India developing **Digital Rupee** (e₹)
* Russia uses digital mechanisms to avoid sanctions

But no **BRICS–crypto trade framework** exists yet.

### **International Reactions**

* The U.S. warns BRICS against replacing the dollar
* President Trump threatens **punitive tariffs** if BRICS develops a new currency

---

## **4. Mains Relevance**

### **Issues and Challenges**

#### **1. Cryptocurrencies as a Tool to Bypass Sanctions**

Benefits for Iran:

* Avoid SWIFT intermediaries
* Move value through decentralised networks like Bitcoin, Ethereum
* Use stablecoins for quick cross-border payments

Challenges:

* Blockchain transactions are traceable
* Exchanges must comply with global AML rules
* U.S. can sanction crypto addresses
* Volatility affects trade pricing
* Large-value transactions are risky to conceal

#### **2. Weak Iranian Regulations**

Private sector complaints:

* No clarity on crypto mining tariffs
* Vague rules on what is permitted
* Unpredictable regulatory decisions
* Lack of investor protection
* Fear of AML crackdowns

This makes Iran’s plan difficult to implement.

#### **3. BRICS Divergence**

* Russia, Iran: strong push for crypto/digital alternatives
* China: prefers state-controlled digital yuan
* India: wants regulated CBDCs, not private cryptocurrencies
* Brazil/South Africa: more cautious

India’s clear position:
**No interest in “de-dollarisation” via crypto.**

This limits Iran’s trade ambitions with India.

#### **4. Technology and Infrastructure Gaps**

* Iran lacks:

  * Scalable blockchain infrastructure
  * Reliable digital payment rails
  * High-complexity cybersecurity systems
* Energy-intensive crypto mining strains Iran’s electricity grid

#### **5. Geopolitical Risks**

* U.S. could:

  * Sanction Iranian crypto exchanges
  * Block mining pools
  * Pressure BRICS nations
  * Target blockchain routes used by Iran

#### **6. Economic Risks**

* High volatility makes crypto unsuitable for stable trade
* Sanctions may target firms dealing with Iranian crypto
* Limited acceptance of crypto for large commodity imports

---

## **5. Way Forward**

### **1. Transparent and Coherent Crypto Regulation**

Iran must:

* Build clear legal frameworks
* Ensure AML/KYC compliance
* Allow regulated exchanges to function
* Define electricity tariffs for mining

This will create investor confidence.

### **2. Develop State-Backed Digital Currency Systems**

Iran may:

* Explore a **Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)**
* Build bilateral digital payment bridges
* Create permissioned blockchain networks

This is more realistic than relying on volatile open cryptocurrencies.

### **3. Strengthen Trade Mechanisms With Friendly Countries**

Use:

* Currency swaps
* Barter arrangements
* Local-currency settlements
* Digital trade agreements

Cryptocurrency can be one tool, not the only tool.

### **4. Encourage Blockchain for Transparency**

Blockchain-based:

* Smart contracts
* Customs documentation
* Trade financing
* Supply chain tracking

can improve governance and reduce corruption.

### **5. Iran’s Private Sector Involvement**

Government must:

* Consult industry players
* Invest in blockchain education
* Encourage innovation hubs
* Support regulated fintech ecosystems

### **6. Risk Mitigation for BRICS**

BRICS nations must:

* Ensure compliance with global norms
* Avoid triggering U.S. secondary sanctions
* Build multilateral digital finance frameworks

### **7. India’s Stance**

Given India’s:

* cautious approach toward private crypto,
* preference for CBDCs, and
* reluctance toward de-dollarisation,

it is unlikely to engage in Iran’s crypto-based trade proposals.
