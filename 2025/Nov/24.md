# Presidential Reference opinion does not overrule a judgment: former CJI
## **Presidential Reference on Governors’ Timelines for Assent**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

**a. Governor’s Role in State Legislation**
When a State Legislature passes a Bill, it is sent to the Governor. The Governor can:

* Give assent
* Withhold assent
* Return the Bill (if not a Money Bill) for reconsideration
* Reserve it for the President

**b. Issue of Delay**
Some Governors have been accused of *sitting on Bills for months or years*. The Constitution does **not** specify a time limit for these actions, leading to friction between State governments and Governors.

**c. What is a Presidential Reference?**
Under **Article 143**, the President can ask the Supreme Court for advice on questions of law or constitutional importance. This advisory opinion:

* Is **not binding**
* Does **not overrule** existing judgments
* Clarifies the legal position for the future

---

### **2. The News**

* Chief Justice of India **B.R. Gavai**, who retired on Sunday, clarified the Supreme Court’s **advisory opinion in the Presidential Reference** concerning timelines for Governors and the President to act on Bills.
* He said the advisory opinion **was not intended to shift the burden onto States** to chase Governors for assent.
* The Court emphasized: **If the Constitution does not specify a timeline, the judiciary cannot insert one**; only **Parliament** can do so by amending the law.
* Background:

  * On **8 April**, in the *Tamil Nadu Governor case*, the Supreme Court held that Governors/President must act within **3 months**, failing which the Bill is **deemed assented**.
  * On **20 November**, a 5-judge Bench—via **Presidential Reference**—said this **3-month timeline cannot be imposed**, as it was not in the Constitution.
  * Governors/President must act only within a **“reasonable period”**, though no definition was provided.

---

### **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

**a. Constitutional Provisions**

* **Article 153–161:** Define Governor’s powers.
* **Article 200:** Governor’s options on State Bills.
* **Article 201:** President’s power when Bills are reserved.

**b. Past Commissions**

* **Sarkaria Commission** and **Punchhi Commission** recommended:

  * Governors should act **within 3 months** on Bills.
  * Central government to ensure neutrality and accountability of the Governor.

**c. Recent Context**

* Repeated conflicts in **Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Telangana, Punjab** over delayed assent.
* States demanded clear timelines; Centre maintained constitutional framework.

---

### **4. Mains Relevance**

#### **Issues & Challenges**

1. **Constitutional Ambiguity**
   No explicit time limit → scope for arbitrary or politically motivated delays.
2. **Federal Tensions**
   Governors seen as agents of the Centre → conflict with elected State governments.
3. **Judicial Limitations**
   Judiciary cannot legislate timelines → separation of powers issue.
4. **Governance Delays**
   Important welfare and administrative schemes get blocked due to pending Bills.
5. **No Definition of “Reasonable Period”**
   Opens the door for subjective interpretation and continued uncertainty.

#### **Impacts**

* **Polity:** Strains Centre–State relations; questions neutrality of constitutional posts.
* **Administration:** Policy paralysis at the State level.
* **Democratic Accountability:** Unelected office (Governor) blocking the mandate of elected legislatures.
* **Judiciary:** Highlights limitations of judicial activism and importance of constitutional boundaries.

#### **Ethical Dimensions**

* Neutrality and integrity of constitutional authorities
* Respect for democratic mandate
* Avoidance of political interference in gubernatorial decisions

---

### **5. Way Forward**

1. **Legislative Amendment**
   Parliament may consider clarifying timelines under Articles 200 and 201 to remove ambiguity.

2. **Clear Definition of “Reasonable Period”**
   Could be framed through a constitutional amendment or guidelines—e.g., 3 months as per Commission reports.

3. **Revisiting Role of Governor**
   Implement Sarkaria & Punchhi Commission recommendations to reduce friction and ensure neutrality.

4. **Institutional Mechanisms**

   * Periodic review of pending Bills by a Joint Committee of the State and Raj Bhavan.
   * Requirement for written reasons when assent is withheld.

5. **Political Neutrality**
   Strengthen appointment procedures and remove the perception of Governor as a political appointee.

6. **Judicial Oversight (Limited but Necessary)**
   Courts can check *arbitrariness* even if they cannot prescribe a timeline.

# No plan to bring Bill on Chandigarh, says Centre
## **Proposed 131st Constitutional Amendment & Chandigarh: Government Clarifies No Such Move**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

#### **a. Chandigarh’s Administrative Status**

* Chandigarh is a **Union Territory (UT)** and **joint capital** of Punjab and Haryana.
* It is administered by the **Union Home Ministry** through an **Administrator/Lt. Governor** (currently the Governor of Punjab acts as Chandigarh’s Administrator).

#### **b. Article 240 of the Constitution**

* Article 240 empowers the **President** to make regulations for certain Union Territories without legislatures (e.g., Andaman & Nicobar, Lakshadweep, Dadra & Nagar Haveli, Ladakh).
* If Chandigarh were brought under Article 240, the Centre could directly **frame regulations** for it without legislative input.

#### **c. Why is Chandigarh sensitive?**

* After the **Punjab Reorganisation Act, 1966**, Punjab was divided into Punjab, Haryana, and Himachal Pradesh.
* Chandigarh became a **UT**, but Punjab has always maintained that Chandigarh should revert to it, making the issue **politically and emotionally charged**.

#### **d. What is the 131st Constitutional Amendment (Proposed) Bill?**

* It appeared in a Lok Sabha Bulletin as a Bill planned for the Winter Session.
* It sought to **align Chandigarh with UTs without legislatures** when its legislative assembly is dissolved/suspended.
* Politically interpreted as: Chandigarh might get an **independent administrator** and come under **direct central control** like other UTs under Article 240.

---

### **2. The News**

* On Sunday, the **Union Home Ministry (MHA)** clarified that the government has **no plan** to introduce a Constitution Amendment Bill to bring Chandigarh under **Article 240** in the upcoming Parliament session.
* The clarification came after **political outrage in Punjab**, where major parties—**Congress, SAD, AAP**—strongly opposed the idea.
* They alleged it was an attempt to:

  * Remove Punjab’s influence over Chandigarh
  * Bring Chandigarh under exclusive Union control
  * Appoint an **independent Administrator**, separate from the Punjab Governor
* The controversy arose because the **Lok Sabha Bulletin (Nov 21)** had listed the **Constitution (131st Amendment) Bill, 2025** among Bills proposed for the Winter Session (from Dec 1).
* MHA added that the proposal is still **under consideration**, and there is **no decision** to push it in this session.

---

### **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

#### **a. Legal/Constitutional Framework**

* **Article 239 & 239AA:** Administration of UTs
* **Article 240:** President’s power to make regulations for UTs **without legislatures**
* **Punjab Reorganisation Act, 1966:** Established Chandigarh as a UT and joint capital
* **Territorial Administration:** Historically, Chandigarh is administered by the Governor of Punjab as its Administrator.

#### **b. Centre’s Stated Position**

* No immediate plan for amendment
* Proposal to **simplify law-making** for Chandigarh is **ongoing**, not final
* No move to alter the existing administrative arrangement as of now

#### **c. Past Recommendations**

* Various committees over decades have examined Centre–State relations and hinted at better clarity on UT governance but **no consensus** exists on Chandigarh.

---

### **4. Mains Relevance**

#### **Issues and Challenges**

1. **Federal Sensitivity**
   Chandigarh is tied to Punjabi identity and history; any central intervention sparks strong political reaction.

2. **Centre–State Relations**
   Bringing Chandigarh under Article 240 could be seen as increasing **central control**, reducing Punjab’s symbolic and administrative connection with the UT.

3. **Political Fallout**
   All major parties in Punjab—despite ideological differences—united against the proposal, showing its high emotional resonance.

4. **Legal Ambiguity**
   Chandigarh is a UT but also a shared capital. The Constitution does not clearly define a long-term solution.

5. **Administrative Efficiency vs. Federal Balance**
   The Centre may want smoother law-making for UTs, but States resist moves that appear to reduce their role.

#### **Impacts**

* **Polity:** Risk of rekindling historic disputes from the 1966 reorganisation.
* **Governance:** Questions on future administrative reforms for UTs without legislatures.
* **Society:** Heightens regional identity politics in Punjab.
* **Centre–State Trust:** Any perceived unilateral move can strain relations.

#### **Ethical/Constitutional Concerns**

* Respect for federalism
* Transparency in constitutional amendments
* Sensitivity toward regional aspirations

---

### **5. Way Forward**

1. **Transparent Consultations**
   Centre should hold structured talks with Punjab and Haryana before altering administrative arrangements.

2. **Clarity on Chandigarh’s Long-Term Status**
   A bipartisan, consultative approach is needed to resolve the long-pending question of Chandigarh.

3. **Avoid Political Miscommunication**
   Parliamentary bulletins should be accompanied by official explanations if the subject is sensitive.

4. **Strengthen Cooperative Federalism**
   Administrative efficiency must not come at the cost of perceived central overreach.
   Mechanisms like **Inter-State Council** or **Zonal Councils** can help build consensus.

5. **Focus on Governance, Not Symbolism**
   Infrastructure, public services, and citizen welfare in Chandigarh should remain the primary focus, regardless of administrative structure.

# UNSC reforms no longer an option but a necessity: Modi at IBSA meet
## **IBSA Summit & India’s Push for UNSC Reform**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

#### **a. What is IBSA?**

IBSA stands for **India–Brazil–South Africa**, a trilateral forum launched in 2003.
It brings together:

* Three **major democracies**
* Three **emerging economies**
* Three **southern continents** — Asia, South America, and Africa

**Core objectives:**

* Promote South–South cooperation
* Strengthen coordination on global governance issues
* Push for reforms in multilateral institutions (UN, WTO, IMF, World Bank)

#### **b. Why is UNSC Reform Important?**

The **UN Security Council** (UNSC) still reflects the power realities of **1945**, not the 21st century.
Key issues:

* Only 5 permanent members
* No representation from Africa or Latin America
* No representation for rising powers like India and Brazil
* Veto power is concentrated and often misused

Therefore, Global South countries demand changes in:

* **Membership structure**
* **Veto power**
* **Decision-making processes**

#### **c. IBSA’s long-standing stance**

All three IBSA countries are part of the **G4 group** demanding permanent UNSC membership (India, Brazil, Germany, Japan) and have consistently called for democratisation of global governance.

---

### **2. The News**

* PM **Narendra Modi**, speaking at the **IBSA Leaders’ Summit**, declared that **UNSC reform is now a necessity**, not merely an option.
* He said IBSA should send a **clear, united message** for reforms in global governance institutions.
* He highlighted the fragmented global situation and said IBSA can deliver a message of **unity, cooperation, and humanity**.
* PM Modi proposed **institutionalising NSA-level meetings** among IBSA countries to enhance security collaboration.
* He emphasised **zero tolerance** and **no double standards** in fighting terrorism.
* The meeting was attended by:

  * **Cyril Ramaphosa**, President of South Africa
  * **Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva**, President of Brazil
* Modi highlighted that IBSA is a bridge between **three continents, three democracies, and three major economies**, making it an important platform in global politics.

---

### **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

#### **a. India’s Diplomatic Push for UNSC Reform**

* India regularly raises UNSC reform at:

  * UN General Assembly
  * G20
  * G4 meetings
  * IBSA meetings
* India’s priority: **Permanent membership** and **better representation of the Global South**.

#### **b. IBSA Cooperation Framework**

* **IBSA Fund for Poverty Alleviation** (UNDP-supported)
* Cooperation in:

  * Trade
  * Defence
  * Cybersecurity
  * Maritime security
  * Climate change
* Dialogue mechanisms already exist, but NSA-level institutionalisation strengthens strategic coordination.

#### **c. India’s Stand on Terrorism**

* India participates in global forums like FATF, INTERPOL, and UN Counter-Terrorism Committee.
* Advocates for a **Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism (CCIT)** at the UN.

---

### **4. Mains Relevance**

#### **Issues & Challenges**

1. **Outdated Global Governance Structures**
   UNSC does not represent the political realities of today. Power imbalance reduces credibility.

2. **Lack of Consensus on UNSC Reform**
   P5 countries resist losing privileged status. African Union demands two permanent seats.

3. **Rise of Multipolarity**
   Emerging powers seek greater voice, but geopolitical rivalries complicate reform.

4. **Threat of Global Fragmentation**
   Conflicts, geopolitical blocks, and economic competition require institutions that are more inclusive.

5. **Double Standards in Counterterrorism**
   Selective labelling of terrorist groups and political vetoing of listings undermine global security.

#### **Impacts**

* **Polity:** Reform strengthens democratic legitimacy of the UNSC.
* **International Relations:** Enhances India’s global influence and aligns with its “Vishwa Mitra” & “Global South champion” image.
* **Security:** NSA-level IBSA coordination enhances intelligence sharing and counterterrorism.
* **Economy:** Stronger IBSA cooperation opens trade and investment avenues.
* **Diplomatic Strategy:** Creates a southern coalition to balance dominance of Western/Northern blocs.

#### **Ethical Dimensions**

* Equality among nations
* Fair representation
* Collective responsibility in global peace
* Transparency in multilateral decision-making

---

### **5. Way Forward**

1. **Build Global South Consensus**
   India should lead a coordinated campaign with IBSA, AU, ASEAN, and G20 members.

2. **Strengthen G4 & IBSA Synergy**
   G4 demands institutional reform; IBSA represents democratic legitimacy. Combining both could strengthen lobbying.

3. **Engage P5 through Diplomacy**
   Address concerns of existing permanent members through issue-based cooperation.

4. **Push for Counterterrorism Reforms at the UN**
   Renew efforts for CCIT and transparency in terror-listing processes.

5. **Institutionalising IBSA Framework**

   * Regular NSA-level meetings
   * Joint military exercises
   * Intelligence-sharing mechanisms
   * Maritime security initiatives in the Indian and South Atlantic Oceans

6. **Leveraging India’s G20 Legacy**
   Use India’s G20 presidency achievements to push for inclusivity and global reform.

# Mind your ‘administrative’ language, says SC report
## **SC Report Calls for Ending Archaic, Caste-Linked Job Titles in Judiciary**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

#### **a. What is “administrative nomenclature”?**

It refers to the **official job titles** used in court administration—titles assigned to staff across various non-judicial roles.
Examples: “halalkhor”, “coolie”, “dhobi”, etc.

Many of these terms:

* Come from **colonial and feudal systems**
* Carry **caste-based stigma**
* Reflect **hierarchies** rather than dignity
* Are inconsistent with constitutional values of **equality and respect**

#### **b. What is meant by “grammar of inequality”?**

The report defines it as:

> A set of unwritten, hierarchical rules inherited from feudal, colonial, caste-based systems that shape how institutions label people.

In simple terms, the language used inside the system **normalises inequality**, reducing people to their caste-linked roles (“thingification”).

#### **c. Why is language important?**

Language shapes:

* Workplace dignity
* Institutional culture
* Recognition of individuals
* Alignment with constitutional values (Articles 14, 15, 21, 23)

---

### **2. The News**

* A new Supreme Court report by the **Centre for Research and Planning (CRP)** recommends that the judiciary must **discard caste-linked and archaic job titles** such as *halalkhor, dhobi, coolie, scavenger, malan, masalchi, cycle sawar, basta bardar, chowkidar,* etc.
* The report is titled:
  **“Reforming administrative nomenclature in the Indian judiciary: Embedding dignity and equity in service rules”**
* It argues that these titles reflect a “grammar of inequality” and enable “thingification” of workers.
* **CJI B.R. Gavai**, in his foreword, said such language normalises **outdated hierarchies** and undermines a respectful work culture.
* On his last day in office, he sent the report to all High Courts, urging them to update administrative nomenclature as a **symbolic but significant reform**.
* The report proposes replacing derogatory titles with **modern, respectful job titles**, such as:

  * *Halalkhor / Scavenger → Sanitation Assistant*
  * *Dhobi → Laundry Operator*
  * *Coolie → Freight Assistant*
  * *Cycle Sawar → Logistics Assistant*
  * *Basta Bardar → Document Handler*
  * *Bundle Lifter → Material Coordinator*
  * *Masalchi → Kitchen Assistant*
  * *Malan → Horticulture Attendant*
* The report stresses:

  > “Align the language of the administration with the language of the Constitution… Language itself is the judiciary’s first act of justice.”

---

### **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

#### **a. Constitutional Safeguards**

* **Article 14** – Equality before law
* **Article 15** – Prohibition of discrimination on caste, race, religion, etc.
* **Article 21** – Right to dignity
* **Article 23** – Prohibition of exploitation
* **Article 17** – Abolition of untouchability

The use of derogatory caste-linked terms violates both **constitutional morality** and **dignity jurisprudence**.

#### **b. Judicial Interventions**

* Courts have consistently held that state institutions must ensure **dignity of labour** and avoid **caste bias**.
* SC judgments on dignity (K.S. Puttaswamy, Navtej Johar) reinforce constitutional morality.

#### **c. Government Initiatives**

While this specific reform is judiciary-led, several initiatives connect:

* **Swachh Bharat Mission**: dignified terminology for sanitation workers
* **Manual Scavengers Rehabilitation Act**: recognition and upliftment
* **National Commission for Safai Karamcharis**: safeguards for sanitation workers

#### **d. Institutional Reform Path**

* High Courts must amend service rules
* Central and State governments may need to update notifications
* Training and sensitisation for court staff

---

### **4. Mains Relevance**

#### **a. Issues & Challenges**

1. **Caste and Occupational Stigma**
   Old job titles directly link caste to work, reinforcing hierarchy.

2. **Colonial Legacy**
   Many terms were created to classify workers based on servitude.

3. **Judicial Inconsistency**
   Judiciary speaks of equality in judgments but uses undignified terminology in administration → gap between principle and practice.

4. **Dignity of Labour**
   Outdated titles reduce workers to objects (“bundle lifter”, “basta bardar”).

5. **Symbolic vs. Substantive Reform**
   Changing names is positive but must accompany better working conditions.

6. **Administrative Inertia**
   Service rules across States differ; implementing uniform reforms is challenging.

#### **b. Impacts**

* **Social:** Reduces caste-based stigma; fosters inclusivity.
* **Institutional Culture:** Enhances respect and dignity for workers.
* **Constitutional Morality:** Judiciary aligns its internal practices with constitutional values.
* **Governance:** Modern, professional terminology improves administrative efficiency.
* **Ethical:** Recognises workers as individuals, not caste-based roles.

---

### **5. Way Forward**

1. **Uniform Nomenclature Reform Across Courts**
   High Courts should adopt the suggested titles and revise service rules.

2. **Capacity Building & Sensitisation**
   Training programmes for court staff on inclusive language and workplace dignity.

3. **Consultation with Workers’ Unions**
   Ensure new titles reflect actual job roles and worker aspiration.

4. **Digital & Administrative Update**
   Update recruitment rules, court websites, and digital case management systems.

5. **Broader Labour Reform**
   Extend similar nomenclature reforms to other public institutions—municipal bodies, hospitals, universities.

6. **Link Language to Working Conditions**
   Dignity must translate into:

   * Better safety equipment
   * Fair wages
   * Protection from hazardous tasks
   * Ending any form of caste-based allocation of duties

7. **Periodic Review Mechanism**
   Judiciary should institutionalise a committee to periodically review job titles and administrative practices.

# Two menhirs believed to be from late megalithic period found
## **Discovery of Two Late Megalithic Menhirs in Udupi (Kundapur Region)**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

#### **a. What are Menhirs?**

* **Menhirs** (locally called **nilskals**) are tall, upright **free-standing stones** erected during prehistoric times.
* They belong to the **Megalithic Culture**, which is associated with:

  * Burials
  * Memorials
  * Ritual structures
* Megaliths include stone circles, dolmens, cairns, menhirs, cists, etc.
* In South India, especially Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala, megaliths are widely distributed.

#### **b. Megalithic Culture in India**

* Roughly **1200 BCE – 300 CE** (varies by region).
* Noted for characteristic pottery, iron tools, and funerary monuments.
* Divided into:

  * **Early Megalithic Phase** → thick pottery
  * **Late Megalithic Phase** → thin pottery, advanced burial patterns

#### **c. Significance of Menhirs**

* Often mark **burial sites**, commemorate ancestors, or serve as ritual markers.
* Provide significant information on:

  * Social organisation
  * Technological development
  * Burial practices
  * Settlement patterns in prehistoric South India

---

### **2. The News**

* The **Adima Kala Trust (R.)**, Udupi, discovered **two menhirs (nilskals)** during explorations in the **Kundapur region**.
* Locations:

  * **Hilkod**, on Neralekatte–Ajri Road
  * **Mavinakere**, in Kenchanur village
* Archaeologist **T. Murugeshi** confirmed:

  * Mavinakere menhir: **112 cm**, leaning NW
  * Hilkod menhir: **135 cm**
* A test trench below the Hilkod menhir revealed **crushed thin red and creamy pottery**, characteristic of the **late megalithic period**.
* According to the archaeologist:

  * These menhirs are from the **last phase of the megalithic culture (300 BCE–1st/2nd century CE)**.
  * They lie **3–4 km apart**, suggesting a connected cultural landscape.
  * Comparative context:

    * The **Heragal group of menhirs in Nagara region, Shivamogga**, are the **oldest in the region (c. 800 BCE)**.
* Hence, these newly found menhirs reflect the **final phase of megalithic tradition** in coastal Karnataka.

---

### **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

#### **a. Protection of Archaeological Heritage**

* **Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act (AMASR Act), 1958**

  * Protects monuments >100 years old
  * Regulates excavation, conservation
* **Archaeological Survey of India (ASI)**

  * Conducts excavation, documentation, and conservation
* **State Archaeology Departments**

  * Karnataka State Archaeology supports regional megalithic studies
* **Schemes for Heritage Preservation**

  * National Mission on Monuments and Antiquities
  * National Digital Archaeology Programme

#### **b. Community & Institutional Roles**

* Local organisations like **Adima Kala Trust** contribute to documenting unprotected sites.
* Collaboration with universities and research scholars strengthens regional archaeology.

---

### **4. Mains Relevance**

#### **a. Issues & Challenges**

1. **Threats to Megalithic Sites**
   Urbanisation, agriculture, road-building, and quarrying destroy many unprotected menhirs.

2. **Lack of Documentation**
   Thousands of megalithic structures in coastal Karnataka and Western Ghats remain unrecorded.

3. **Limited Funding for Regional Archaeology**
   Small trusts and scholars often carry out surveys without institutional financial support.

4. **Loss of Cultural Landscapes**
   Megalithic monuments often occur in clusters; erosion of one affects interpretation of the whole region.

5. **Need for Scientific Dating**
   Many sites remain undated; relative dating (pottery thickness, typology) is used instead of radiocarbon dating.

#### **b. Impacts**

* **Historical Understanding:** Provides insight into late megalithic communities in Karnataka.
* **Cultural Linkages:** Shows continuity of burial/memorial practices from 800 BCE to early centuries CE.
* **Regional Archaeological Mapping:** Adds to the megalithic landscape of Udupi, Kundapur, Shivamogga.
* **Tourism Potential:** Can contribute to heritage-based eco-cultural tourism.
* **Anthropological Significance:** Helps reconstruct social and ritual practices of early Iron Age societies.

---

### **5. Way Forward**

1. **Scientific Dating & Detailed Excavation**
   Use radiocarbon dating, archaeobotanical and metallurgical studies to confirm chronology and cultural context.

2. **Official Protection Status**
   Propose these menhirs for inclusion under **state-protected monuments** to prevent destruction.

3. **Digital Preservation**
   3D scanning, GIS mapping, and creating digital archives for academic access.

4. **Community Awareness Programmes**
   Engage local communities to protect the sites and discourage vandalism or land modification.

5. **Integrated Regional Study**
   Conduct a systematic survey linking Kundapur, Udupi, and Shivamogga megalithic clusters to build a clearer timeline.

6. **Collaboration with ASI & Universities**
   Joint excavations can produce deeper insights and bring academic legitimacy to local discoveries.

7. **Tourism & Interpretation Centres**
   Establish megalithic trails with information boards to promote heritage education.

# In a boost to conservation, Centre rejects two quarry proposals in Western Ghats
## **MoEF&CC Rejects Quarry Proposals in Ankola & Karwar to Protect Western Ghats**

### **1. Basic Understanding**

#### **a. What are Forest Diversion Proposals?**

Under the **Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980**, any proposal seeking to divert forestland for non-forest purposes (mining, quarrying, roads, industries) must get approval from MoEF&CC based on ecological, social, and legal assessments.

#### **b. Western Ghats: A Biodiversity Hotspot**

* One of the **world’s 8 hottest biodiversity hotspots**
* Stretches across 6 Indian states
* UNESCO World Heritage Site (multiple clusters)
* Home to **tigers, elephants, endemic amphibians, unique flora and fauna**
* Ecologically fragile: steep slopes, heavy rainfall, prone to landslips and soil erosion
* Plays critical roles in **monsoon regulation**, **river systems**, **carbon sequestration**, and **biodiversity connectivity**

#### **c. Eco-Sensitive Areas (ESA)**

* Identified under **Environment (Protection) Act, 1986**
* Regulated zones where quarrying, mining, construction, and polluting industries are restricted
* Aim: prevent irreversible ecological damage

---

### **2. The News**

* The **Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC)** has **rejected two quarry-related proposals** in **Ankola and Karwar taluks**, Uttara Kannada district, Karnataka.

* The proposals sought diversion of:

  * **3.55 ha** in *Baleguli village (Ankola)*
  * **0.49 ha** in *Arav village (Karwar)*

* Findings from on-site inspections:

  * Despite being leased for cashew cultivation, the Ankola site contained **substantial natural vegetation** and **undocumented flora**.
  * Both sites are on **steep, erosion-prone slopes** with a history of **heavy rainfall**, increasing landslip risk.
  * The Karwar site lies within the **notified Western Ghats Eco-Sensitive Area**, hosting **dense tropical moist deciduous forests**.
  * Rich **wildlife presence** was recorded:

    * Tiger pugmarks
    * Leopard, mouse deer, pangolin, sloth bear, sambar
    * Jungle cat, jackal, monitor lizard, reticulated python
  * Several species fall under **Schedule I** of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.

* The regional office recommended rejection due to significant ecological risks, and the MoEF&CC accepted the report.

* Environmentalists emphasised that a tiger recently travelled **360 km from Nagarahole Tiger Reserve to Karwar**, highlighting the need to preserve wildlife corridors.

---

### **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

#### **a. Legal Framework**

* **Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980**
* **Environment (Protection) Act, 1986**
* **Wildlife Protection Act, 1972** (Schedule I species receive highest protection)
* **CRZ Rules** (coastal regulation, relevant for Western Ghats rivers draining to the coast)
* **Western Ghats ESA Notifications** (based on Gadgil and Kasturirangan committees)

#### **b. Conservation Efforts in Western Ghats**

* **Project Tiger**, **Project Elephant**, eco-sensitive zones around reserves
* **Compensatory Afforestation Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA)**
* **National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA)** guidance on wildlife corridors
* **Forest Working Plans** prioritising slope stability and landslip-prone areas
* **National Biodiversity Mission** & State biodiversity boards documenting endemic species

#### **c. Institutional Monitoring**

* Regional MoEF&CC offices conduct **site inspections**, **biodiversity assessments**, and review **tree enumeration** before diversion approvals.

---

### **4. Mains Relevance**

#### **Issues & Challenges**

1. **Ecological Fragility of Western Ghats**
   Quarrying leads to soil destabilisation, landslides, watershed disruption, and fragmentation of habitats.

2. **Wildlife Movement & Corridor Protection**
   Presence of tiger pugmarks and a recorded long-distance tiger movement highlight the importance of contiguous forest cover.

3. **Unregulated Quarrying**
   Uttara Kannada and coastal Karnataka have a history of illegal and poorly regulated quarrying, worsening landslides and flooding.

4. **Climate Change Vulnerability**
   Steep slopes + intense monsoons = high landslip risk. Disturbance could trigger irreversible damage.

5. **Human-Wildlife Conflict**
   Habitat destruction forces wildlife into human settlements.

6. **Data Deficiency**
   Undocumented flora and underestimated forest density highlight gaps in ecological surveys.

#### **Impacts**

* **Environmental:** Preserves biodiversity, prevents soil erosion, maintains watershed health.
* **Climate:** Protects carbon sinks and climate-regulating forests.
* **Wildlife Conservation:** Ensures movement corridors for tigers and other species.
* **Disaster Management:** Reduces landslide and flooding risks.
* **Policy:** Sets a precedent for stricter scrutiny of extractive projects in ESAs.
* **Social:** Protects livelihoods dependent on forest ecosystem services.

---

### **5. Way Forward**

1. **Strengthen Monitoring of ESAs**
   Deploy satellite-based monitoring, drones, and real-time reporting in Western Ghats.

2. **Comprehensive Biodiversity Surveys**
   Conduct independent flora-fauna studies before any land-use decision.

3. **Landscape-Level Management**
   Recognise that wildlife movements (e.g., tiger’s 360 km travel) require **continuous forest corridors**, not fragmented patches.

4. **Regulate Quarrying Strictly**
   Ban new quarries in erosion-prone and high-rainfall slopes; enforce buffer zones.

5. **Community-Based Conservation**
   Empower local communities, Forest Rights Committees, and Biodiversity Management Committees.

6. **Integrate Climate & Disaster Data**
   Incorporate IMD rainfall patterns, geological assessments, and NDMA guidelines into clearance decisions.

7. **Strengthen ESA Notifications**
   Resolve state-centre differences, update ESA maps, and expand protection to high-biodiversity patches.

8. **Tree Re-enumeration & Restoration Plans**
   Conduct detailed enumeration and restore degraded slopes with native species.

9. **Promote Sustainable Livelihoods**
   Eco-tourism, NTFP-based livelihoods, and conservation jobs can replace quarrying-dependent incomes.
