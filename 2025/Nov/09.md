# Centre rules out Kuki-Zo groups’ U.T. demand
## **Kuki-Zo Insurgent Groups Demand Union Territory Status**

---

### **1. Basic Understanding**

* **Who are the Kuki-Zo people?**
  The Kuki-Zo (including Kuki, Zomi, and related tribes) are tribal communities inhabiting the hill districts of Manipur and parts of Mizoram and Myanmar.

* **What is the SoO (Suspension of Operations) pact?**
  It is a *tripartite ceasefire agreement* signed between the **Union Government, the Manipur Government, and Kuki-Zo insurgent groups** in 2008.

  * The pact suspends military operations against these groups while they agree to stay within designated camps and engage in peace talks.
  * The aim is to bring militant groups into the mainstream through political dialogue.

* **Union Territory (UT) with Legislature:**
  A **Union Territory with a Legislature** (like Delhi or Puducherry) has partial statehood — with an elected assembly and limited autonomy, but under greater control of the Union Government.

---

### **2. The News**

* **What Happened:**
  The **Kuki National Organisation (KNO)** and **United People’s Front (UPF)** — umbrella bodies of Kuki-Zo insurgent groups — held talks with the **Union Home Ministry (MHA)** on **November 6 and 7, 2025**.

  * Their **core demand** was for a **Union Territory with a Legislative Assembly** for Kuki-Zo areas, arguing that coexistence within Manipur was no longer possible after the 2023 ethnic violence.

* **Centre’s Response:**
  The Centre, represented by **A.K. Mishra**, the MHA’s Northeast Adviser, clarified that the **creation of new UTs is not possible under current policy**, and that **consultations with other communities** (especially Meiteis and Nagas) are essential before any settlement.

* **Discussions Covered:**

  * Governance in Kuki-Zo districts
  * Protection of **tribal land rights** and **customary authority of village chiefs**
  * Simplifying **land registration** procedures (currently centred in Imphal, which is unsafe for Kukis post-violence)
  * **Confidence-building measures** to continue the peace process

* **Background Context:**

  * The **September 4, 2025 renegotiated SoO pact** reaffirmed Manipur’s territorial integrity but allowed for a **“negotiated political settlement within the Constitution of India.”**
  * This pact resumed after being suspended in February 2024 when the Manipur government accused Kuki-Zo groups of violating its terms during the **May 2023 ethnic violence**, which killed around **250 people** and displaced over **60,000**.

---

### **3. Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Tripartite SoO Agreement (2008 – ongoing):**
  Framework for peace dialogue between government and insurgent groups.

* **Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) Northeast Division:**

  * Oversees insurgency management, border issues, and peace negotiations in the region.
  * A.K. Mishra has been a key negotiator in several Northeast peace processes, including those in Nagaland and Manipur.

* **Recent Measures (2025):**

  * Verification of cadres to identify genuine insurgents.
  * De-listing and deportation of foreign nationals.
  * Relocation of militant camps.
  * Emphasis on *constitutional settlement* rather than territorial division.

* **Constitutional Provisions Relevant:**

  * **Article 239–239A:** Administration of Union Territories and creation of UTs with legislatures.
  * **Sixth Schedule (Article 244):** Autonomous District Councils in tribal areas (but not applicable to Manipur; Kukis have long demanded its extension).

---

### **4. Mains Relevance**

#### **a. Issues and Challenges**

* **Ethnic Polarization:**
  Deep-rooted mistrust between Meiteis (valley) and Kukis (hills) has made coexistence difficult.

* **Governance Vacuum:**
  Inaccessibility of administrative systems in Imphal for Kuki-Zo residents post-violence has created alienation.

* **Territorial Integrity vs Autonomy:**
  The Centre must balance **Manipur’s unity** with **tribal self-determination demands**.

* **Complex Historical Claims:**
  Kuki-Zo groups argue that their areas were historically outside the control of the Manipur State Durbar pre-1947 — a claim contested by others.

* **Security and Law Enforcement:**
  Verification of insurgent cadres and control over arms remain crucial for peace.

#### **b. Impacts**

* **Political:** Could reshape Manipur’s internal boundaries and inter-community power dynamics.
* **Social:** Risk of deepening ethnic divisions if one group’s demand is seen as separatist.
* **Economic:** Development in tribal areas stalled due to instability; peace could unlock growth potential.
* **Security:** Any breakdown of the SoO could escalate insurgent violence again.

#### **c. Ethical and Governance Dimensions**

* Balancing **justice for victims** of violence with **inclusive peace negotiations**.
* Upholding **constitutional morality** while acknowledging ethnic sensitivities.

---

### **5. Way Forward**

1. **Inclusive Dialogue:**
   Continue multi-stakeholder talks involving Kukis, Meiteis, Nagas, and civil society — to prevent exclusive settlements.

2. **Enhanced Local Autonomy (within Manipur):**
   Instead of UT status, strengthen the **Autonomous District Councils (ADCs)** under the Manipur (Hill Areas) District Councils Act, 1971.

   * Empower them with financial and administrative autonomy.

3. **Rehabilitation and Reconciliation:**
   Implement robust programmes for **resettlement of displaced persons**, inter-community **confidence-building**, and **truth and reconciliation** mechanisms.

4. **Administrative Decentralization:**
   Establish **separate administrative hubs** in hill districts to make governance accessible.

5. **Developmental Focus:**
   Prioritize **infrastructure, education, health, and connectivity** in Kuki-Zo areas under the **North East Special Infrastructure Development Scheme (NESIDS)** and **PM-DevINE**.

6. **Constitutional Approach:**
   Ensure all demands are pursued **within the framework of the Indian Constitution**, avoiding precedents of territorial fragmentation.

# What’s the plan to relocate forest tribes?
## **Reconciling Conservation and Community Rights: New Policy Framework for Tiger Reserve Relocations (2025)**

---

### **1. Basic Understanding**

#### **a. Background**

* India’s **tiger conservation policy** has historically relied on creating **“inviolate spaces”** — core zones of tiger reserves free from human habitation.

* Since **Project Tiger (1973)**, this has led to **relocation of forest-dwelling communities**, particularly Scheduled Tribes, from **core areas** of tiger reserves.

* These relocations were governed by:

  * **Wildlife (Protection) Act (WPA), 1972** — empowers forest departments to establish tiger reserves and protect wildlife.
  * **Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006** — recognises the rights of forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes and other traditional forest dwellers (OTFDs) to live in and manage forest resources.

* The tension between these two laws has often led to **conflict between conservation goals and tribal rights.**

#### **b. Current Scenario**

* According to the **National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA)**:

  * As of 2024, **64,801 families across 591 villages** still reside within core areas of tiger reserves.
  * Since 2022, **5,166 families from 56 villages** have been relocated from reserves in 7 States.
* However, reports of **forced relocations**, **lack of FRA compliance**, and **non-provision of basic amenities** for those who stayed back prompted widespread protests and legal challenges — e.g., by the **Jenu Kuruba tribe** in Karnataka’s Nagarhole Tiger Reserve.

---

### **2. The News**

#### **Event:**

* The **Union Ministry of Tribal Affairs (MoTA)**, in **October 2025**, released a **policy framework** titled
  **“Reconciling Conservation and Community Rights: A Policy Framework for Relocation and Co-existence in India’s Tiger Reserves.”**

#### **Purpose:**

* To ensure that **relocations are truly voluntary, rights-compliant, scientifically justified, and dignified**.
* To establish an institutional mechanism for **joint oversight** by the **Environment Ministry (MoEFCC)** and **Tribal Affairs Ministry (MoTA)**.

#### **Trigger:**

* Followed the **June 2024 NTCA directive** urging States to prioritise relocations from tiger reserves — which sparked **protests by Gram Sabhas** and complaints to the **National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST)**.
* MoTA received **representations from State governments and Gram Sabhas** highlighting **non-implementation of FRA** within tiger reserves.

---

### **3. Government Framework & Key Provisions**

#### **a. Core Principles:**

1. **Relocation as the Last Resort:**

   * Should occur **only when coexistence is scientifically impossible.**
   * FRA rights must be **settled and recorded first** before any relocation.

2. **Voluntariness and Consent:**

   * Gram Sabha consent **before notification** of any area as a tiger reserve.
   * Consent must be **verifiable at both village and household level.**

3. **Co-existence Option:**

   * Communities may **choose to continue residing** within reserves by exercising **FRA habitat rights**.
   * They may participate in **biodiversity conservation, eco-tourism, and management committees.**

4. **Affirmative Duty of the State:**

   * The framework stresses that the **State has a constitutional duty** to protect tribal and forest-dweller rights, and may restrict them only for **demonstrable ecological necessity**.

---

#### **b. Institutional Mechanisms Proposed:**

| **Mechanism**                                                            | **Function**                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **National Framework for Community-Centred Conservation and Relocation** | To be jointly developed by MoTA and MoEFCC — defining procedures, timelines, and accountability. |
| **National Database on Conservation-Community Interface (NDCCI)**        | To digitally record and monitor all relocations, compensation, and post-relocation outcomes.     |
| **Annual Independent Audits**                                            | Conducted by empanelled agencies to check compliance with FRA, WPA, and human rights norms.      |
| **Joint Committees**                                                     | Inclusion of MoTA representatives in State-level relocation oversight bodies.                    |
| **Training and Guidelines**                                              | For field officers and Gram Sabhas on rights, consent, and relocation protocols.                 |

---

#### **c. Compensation and Welfare Measures:**

* Current relocation package: **₹15 lakh per family**.
* Framework emphasises **transparency, livelihood rehabilitation**, and **infrastructure provision** (housing, healthcare, education, roads, and water supply) for both:

  * Villages opting to relocate, and
  * Villages choosing to stay within the reserves.

---

### **4. Mains Relevance**

#### **a. Issues and Challenges**

1. **Conflict Between Conservation and Rights:**

   * Wildlife laws often focus on species protection, while FRA emphasises human rights.
   * Balancing both has been administratively difficult.

2. **Implementation Gaps:**

   * Poor record of **FRA right settlement** within protected areas.
   * **Lack of independent monitoring** and **pressure on villagers** to relocate.

3. **Ecological Concerns:**

   * Human activities in core areas (grazing, resource extraction) can threaten tiger habitats — requiring scientific, site-specific assessment.

4. **Institutional Overlaps:**

   * NTCA (under MoEFCC) and MoTA often work in **silos** with differing priorities.

5. **Social Impacts of Relocation:**

   * Loss of livelihoods, cultural dislocation, and poverty among displaced tribal communities.

#### **b. Impacts of the Framework**

* **Positive:**

  * Empowers communities through **consent and co-management.**
  * Introduces **transparency and data-driven accountability.**
  * Strengthens **coordination between environment and tribal affairs ministries.**

* **Challenges Ahead:**

  * Translating the framework into enforceable law.
  * Capacity-building of State officials and Gram Sabhas.
  * Ensuring ecological goals are not compromised.

#### **c. Ethical and Governance Dimensions**

* Justice vs. Ecology: Balancing biodiversity protection with the **constitutional rights of marginalized communities.**
* Participatory governance: Recognising tribal knowledge as central to conservation success.
* Human dignity: Preventing displacement under coercion or misinformation.

---

### **5. Way Forward**

1. **Joint Implementation Framework:**

   * Formal MoTA–MoEFCC agreement for shared oversight and grievance redress mechanisms.

2. **Codify Consent Mechanisms:**

   * Establish **standard operating procedures (SOPs)** for Gram Sabha and household-level verification.

3. **Empower Local Communities:**

   * Promote **community-based tiger conservation** models — eco-tourism, forest produce enterprises, and habitat restoration.

4. **Scientific Assessment:**

   * Relocation decisions must rely on **independent ecological impact studies.**

5. **Transparent Monitoring:**

   * Operationalise the **NDCCI** to track all relocation cases in real time.

6. **Strengthen Legal Convergence:**

   * Harmonise FRA and WPA through an **inter-ministerial protocol** to eliminate ambiguity in jurisdiction.

7. **Capacity Building:**

   * Regular training for forest and revenue officials on rights-based conservation and participatory governance.
