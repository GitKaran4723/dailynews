# Centre says right to vote different from freedom of voting
---

## **Right to Vote vs. Freedom of Voting – Centre’s Argument in Supreme Court**

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

To understand the issue, we must first differentiate between two important legal concepts:

* **Right to Vote:**

  * It is a **statutory right**, meaning it is granted by an Act of Parliament — specifically, the **Representation of the People Act (RPA), 1951**.
  * Parliament can regulate or even restrict this right through laws. It is *not* guaranteed by the Constitution directly.
* **Freedom of Voting:**

  * This refers to the **right of a voter to express his or her choice freely**, including the right to vote for or against a candidate.
  * The Supreme Court in earlier cases (like *PUCL vs. Union of India*, 2013) held that the **“freedom of voting”** — which includes the right to vote *none of the above (NOTA)* — is a part of the **fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a)**.

Hence, while the *act* of voting is statutory, the *expression* of choice is constitutional.

---

### 2. **The News**

* **What Happened:** The **Central Government** has argued before the **Supreme Court** that the *“right to vote”* and *“freedom of voting”* are distinct — the first being statutory and the second being a fundamental right.
* **When & Where:** The matter came up for hearing before a **Bench led by Justice Surya Kant**, but the **Bench did not assemble** on **Thursday (November 2025)**.
* **Who Is Involved:** The case concerns the **Government of India (Centre)** and a **petitioner** challenging certain provisions of election law — namely,

  * **Section 53(2)** of the **Representation of the People Act, 1951**, and
  * **Rule 11 with Forms 21 and 21B** of the **Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961**.
* **What the Petition Seeks:** The petitioner wants these provisions struck down as **unconstitutional**, claiming they violate **Article 19(1)(a)** — the freedom of speech and expression.

  * Section 53(2) applies in **uncontested elections**, where the number of candidates equals the number of available seats, leading to automatic declaration of winners *without polling*.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

* **Representation of the People Act, 1951 (RPA):**
  The main legislation governing elections in India — defines the process of nomination, polling, counting, and declaration of results.
* **Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961:**
  Provides procedural guidelines — including Forms (21, 21B) used to declare results, especially for uncontested seats.
* **Past Judicial Interventions:**

  * *PUCL vs. Union of India (2013):* Supreme Court upheld that the right to vote is statutory, but the decision to vote (or not vote) is a form of expression under Article 19(1)(a).
  * *Kuldip Nayar vs. Union of India (2006):* Reiterated that voting rights flow from statute, not directly from the Constitution.
* **Election Commission of India (ECI):**
  Responsible for enforcing electoral laws, ensuring free and fair elections, and implementing reforms like **NOTA** to protect voter freedom.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

**GS Paper II – Polity and Governance**

#### **Issues and Challenges**

* **Uncontested Elections:**
  Automatic victories deny voters a chance to express dissent or support, possibly weakening democratic legitimacy.
* **Conflict Between Statutory and Fundamental Rights:**
  The case questions whether a statutory procedure can limit a constitutionally protected freedom of expression.
* **Freedom of Expression in Elections:**
  The case expands the debate on how far Article 19(1)(a) extends in electoral contexts — does it include the right to *not vote* or *demand a poll*?

#### **Impacts**

* **Democracy:** Could strengthen the participatory nature of Indian democracy by ensuring that every election includes voter choice.
* **Legal Precedent:** May redefine the relationship between statutory and constitutional rights in election law.
* **Governance:** Forces the government and ECI to revisit how elections are conducted in constituencies with limited competition.

#### **Ethical and Governance Concerns**

* Lack of voter participation in uncontested polls may erode **public trust** in the democratic process.
* The **balance between administrative efficiency** (declaring uncontested winners) and **democratic inclusiveness** is ethically significant.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Ensure Electoral Contestation:**
   Amend Section 53(2) to mandate at least a minimum polling process (even symbolic) to uphold voter participation.
2. **Enhance Voter Expression:**
   Strengthen the **NOTA mechanism** and explore the idea of a **“Right to Reject”** in uncontested or single-candidate elections.
3. **Promote Intra-party Democracy:**
   Encourage political parties to nominate candidates based on merit and inclusivity, avoiding local monopolies.
4. **Judicial Clarity:**
   The Supreme Court’s ruling should clearly delineate between statutory and constitutional aspects of voting to prevent future ambiguities.
5. **Public Awareness:**
   Educate citizens about their voting rights — both as a legal entitlement and a constitutional expression of democracy.

## **Supreme Court on Surrogacy for Second Child – Regulation vs. Reproductive Rights**

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

#### **What is Surrogacy?**

* **Surrogacy** is an assisted reproductive process where a woman (the surrogate) agrees to carry and deliver a child for another person or couple (the intending parents).
* Two main types:

  * **Altruistic Surrogacy:** No monetary compensation; only medical and pregnancy-related expenses are covered.
  * **Commercial Surrogacy:** Involves payment to the surrogate — banned in India.

#### **Legal Framework in India**

* **Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021:**

  * Bans commercial surrogacy.
  * Permits only *altruistic surrogacy* for eligible Indian married couples, widows, and divorcees.
  * **Section 4(iii)(C)(II):** A couple can opt for surrogacy only if they **do not have any surviving child**, whether biological, adopted, or born through surrogacy.
  * Exceptions: Existing child is physically/mentally challenged or suffers from a life-threatening disorder.
* **ART (Assisted Reproductive Technology) Regulation Act, 2021:**

  * Regulates ART clinics and banks to prevent misuse and ensure ethical practices.

#### **Secondary Infertility**

* Occurs when a couple who previously conceived naturally is **unable to conceive again or carry a pregnancy to term**.
* Causes: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), endometriosis, stress, and lifestyle factors.

---

### 2. **The News**

* **What Happened:**
  A **couple suffering from secondary infertility** petitioned the **Supreme Court** to permit **surrogacy for their second child**, challenging the restriction under **Section 4(iii)(C)(II)** of the **Surrogacy Act, 2021**.

* **Petitioners’ Argument:**

  * The **state cannot interfere** in **private lives and reproductive choices**, which are part of **personal liberty under Article 21**.
  * The **definition of infertility** in the Surrogacy and ART Acts does **not restrict** it to only first-time infertility (primary).

* **Government’s Stand:**

  * Surrogacy is **not a fundamental right**; it involves **using another woman’s body**, and thus requires reasonable legal restrictions.

* **Court’s Response:**

  * The Bench (Justice Surya Kant) orally observed that the **restriction appears “reasonable”**, but decided to **examine whether the ban on surrogacy for secondary infertility** violates the **reproductive freedom** of citizens.

* **Context:**

  * Earlier, the Supreme Court allowed **age relaxation** for couples with **frozen embryos prior to 2021**, showing a flexible interpretation of the law.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

#### **1. Legislative Framework**

* **Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021:**

  * Objective: Prevent **commercial exploitation of women**, ensure **ethical surrogacy practices**.
  * Permits altruistic surrogacy only for **Indian heterosexual married couples** (married for at least 5 years), with **age limits**:

    * Female partner: 23–50 years
    * Male partner: 26–55 years

* **ART (Regulation) Act, 2021:**

  * Works alongside the Surrogacy Act to regulate **IVF clinics, gamete donation, and embryo transfer**.

#### **2. Constitutional & Policy Backing**

* **Article 21:** Protects the **right to privacy** and **reproductive autonomy** (as affirmed in *Puttaswamy vs. Union of India*, 2017).
* **Article 19(1)(a):** Ensures freedom of expression, indirectly supporting autonomy in life choices.
* **National Health Policy (2017):** Recognizes **reproductive and maternal health** as a key goal.

#### **3. Ethical Oversight**

* **National and State Surrogacy Boards** established under the Act to:

  * Approve surrogacy requests.
  * Monitor clinics.
  * Ensure no financial exploitation occurs.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### **GS Paper II – Governance, Polity, and Social Justice**

##### **Issues and Challenges**

1. **Conflict Between Law and Personal Liberty:**

   * Restricting surrogacy for secondary infertility questions the **extent of state control over personal reproductive rights**.
2. **Gender & Bodily Autonomy:**

   * The surrogate’s consent vs. the intending couple’s reproductive freedom must both be protected.
3. **Ethical and Moral Dimensions:**

   * Balancing reproductive freedom with **concerns of exploitation** and **commercialization** of women’s bodies.
4. **Definitional Ambiguity:**

   * The term “infertility” lacks precise statutory clarity — does it include secondary infertility or not?
5. **Policy Paradox:**

   * While India has no law limiting the number of children, the Surrogacy Act indirectly **restricts family size** through eligibility criteria.

##### **Impacts**

* **Social:** May create emotional and psychological distress for couples facing secondary infertility.
* **Legal:** Could lead to reinterpretation of the **scope of reproductive rights** under Article 21.
* **Policy:** Tests the boundary between **ethical regulation and individual autonomy**.
* **Gender Justice:** Impacts women’s reproductive agency, both as intending mothers and potential surrogates.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Re-examine the Definition of Infertility:**

   * Amend the Surrogacy and ART Acts to **explicitly include secondary infertility** under valid medical grounds for surrogacy.

2. **Adopt a Rights-Based Interpretation:**

   * Courts and lawmakers should recognize **reproductive choice** as an **essential component of personal liberty** under Article 21.

3. **Ensure Ethical Safeguards, Not Blanket Bans:**

   * Focus on **preventing exploitation**, not restricting access — ensure proper screening, informed consent, and medical oversight.

4. **Transparent and Inclusive Policy Process:**

   * Consult medical experts, women’s rights groups, and legal scholars to balance ethics, health, and liberty.

5. **Public Awareness and Regulation:**

   * Educate citizens about the **ethical, legal, and medical aspects of surrogacy** to reduce misuse and stigma.

6. **Periodic Review of the Law:**

   * Establish a **five-year review mechanism** to update the law with technological and social changes in reproductive health.

# Redraw welfare architecture, place a UBI in the centre
---

## **Universal Basic Income (UBI): Rethinking Welfare in a Time of Inequality and Automation**

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

#### **What is Universal Basic Income (UBI)?**

* **Definition:** A *Universal Basic Income* is a **periodic, unconditional cash transfer** made by the government to every citizen — regardless of income, employment, or social status.
* **Core Principles:**

  1. **Universality:** Everyone receives it, eliminating eligibility filters.
  2. **Unconditionality:** No strings attached — not tied to work or welfare compliance.
  3. **Periodicity:** Paid at regular intervals (monthly/annually).
  4. **Individuality:** Paid to individuals, not households.

#### **Theoretical Rationale**

* UBI aims to **guarantee a minimum standard of living**, **reduce poverty**, and **enhance dignity and autonomy**.
* It redefines the welfare state by focusing on *rights-based entitlements* rather than *targeted subsidies*.
* Historically linked to thinkers like **Thomas Paine**, **Milton Friedman (Negative Income Tax)**, and more recently, **Amartya Sen** and **Guy Standing**.

#### **Why is UBI being discussed now?**

* **Automation & AI:** Threat of mass job displacement.
* **Inequality:** Rising wealth concentration in top 1%.
* **Welfare inefficiencies:** Leakages, exclusions, and administrative burdens in targeted schemes.
* **Moral Argument:** Dignity and agency are fundamental — poverty should not equate to indignity.

---

### 2. **The News**

* **Context:** India faces **widening income and wealth inequality**, **automation-driven job loss**, and **social insecurity**.
* **What Happened:** Experts, economists, and policy commentators are calling for a **re-examination of Universal Basic Income (UBI)** as a **pragmatic, not utopian, solution**.
* **Key Arguments in Favour:**

  * A **UBI can stabilize consumption** amid job-shedding automation.
  * It **simplifies welfare delivery**, avoiding duplication and leakages.
  * It **recognizes unpaid labour**, especially women’s care work.
  * It can **restore citizen trust** by making welfare *rights-based* rather than *politically motivated giveaways*.
* **Supporting Data:**

  * **Wealth Inequality (WID, 2023):**

    * Top 1% hold **40% of national wealth**.
    * Top 10% control **77% of total wealth**.
  * **GDP Growth (2023–24):** 8.4%, but **not translating into equitable prosperity**.
  * **World Happiness Report 2023:** India ranked **126th of 137 nations**.
* **Pilot Evidence:**

  * **SEWA Pilot (Madhya Pradesh, 2011–13):** Showed improved nutrition, school attendance, and earnings.
  * **International Evidence:** Finland, Kenya, and Iran pilots demonstrated **better mental health and economic stability** without reducing work motivation.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

#### **1. Existing Social Protection Framework**

* **Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT):** Transfers subsidies directly into beneficiaries’ accounts.
* **Aadhaar & Jan Dhan:** Provide digital and financial infrastructure for direct cash transfers.
* **Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA):** Guarantees 100 days of wage employment.
* **Public Distribution System (PDS):** Ensures food security through subsidized grains.

#### **2. Government Reports and Policy Proposals**

* **Economic Survey 2016–17:**

  * Proposed **UBI as a conceptually appealing idea** for India.
  * Suggested replacing multiple subsidies with a single cash transfer to reduce inefficiencies.
* **State-Level Experiments:**

  * **Sikkim (2019):** Proposed implementing UBI using hydropower revenues.
  * **Madhya Pradesh (SEWA-UNICEF Pilot):** Demonstrated socio-economic benefits.

#### **3. Legal and Constitutional Context**

* **Article 21 (Right to Life):** Interpreted by courts to include *right to live with dignity*, providing a moral foundation for UBI.
* **Directive Principles (Article 38 & 41):** Mandate the state to ensure *social and economic justice* and *public assistance* in cases of unemployment and need.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### **GS Paper II – Welfare Schemes & Inclusive Growth**

##### **Issues and Challenges**

| **Dimension**                     | **Challenges**                                                                                      |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fiscal Feasibility**            | A minimal UBI (₹7,620/year per person) could cost ~5% of GDP — significant fiscal pressure.         |
| **Targeting vs. Universality**    | Universality risks benefitting the rich; targeting risks exclusion of genuine poor.                 |
| **Inflation & Market Effects**    | Critics fear cash inflows may raise prices; evidence shows modest UBI levels are inflation-neutral. |
| **Administrative Infrastructure** | Requires robust Aadhaar-linked DBT systems and digital inclusion.                                   |
| **Dependency Debate**             | Concerns over work disincentives; however, evidence shows recipients continue to seek work.         |

##### **Impacts**

* **Economic:**

  * Boosts demand and rural consumption.
  * Encourages entrepreneurship and risk-taking.
* **Social:**

  * Reduces inequality and social stigma of “being poor.”
  * Recognizes unpaid care work, especially by women.
* **Political:**

  * Shifts welfare politics from *populist freebies* to *rights-based citizenship*.
  * Encourages voters to demand better governance instead of short-term benefits.
* **Moral-Philosophical:**

  * Redefines the **citizen-state relationship** on equality and dignity.
  * Anchors welfare in *citizenship*, not *charity*.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Phased Implementation:**

   * Begin with **vulnerable groups** — women, elderly, disabled, and low-income households.
   * Gradually scale to full universality after pilot evaluations.

2. **Rationalize Subsidies:**

   * Merge overlapping welfare schemes and reallocate inefficient subsidies to fund UBI.
   * Estimated 2–3% of GDP could be freed through rationalisation.

3. **Strengthen Digital Infrastructure:**

   * Bridge gaps in **banking, mobile access, and financial literacy**, especially in rural and tribal areas.
   * Ensure Aadhaar-DBT systems are transparent and grievance-free.

4. **Complement, Not Replace, Existing Schemes:**

   * Initially retain **PDS** and **MGNREGA** to avoid welfare vacuum during transition.

5. **Fiscal Innovations:**

   * Explore **progressive taxation**, **wealth tax**, and **carbon tax** to sustainably fund UBI.

6. **Institutional Oversight:**

   * Set up an **Independent Fiscal Council** to assess UBI’s macroeconomic effects.
   * Mandate periodic reviews of fiscal sustainability and social impact.

7. **Build Political Consensus:**

   * UBI must be a **non-partisan reform**, enshrined in national social protection policy rather than short-term populism.

---

### ✅ **Summary Insight**

A **Universal Basic Income** is not just an economic tool — it is a **moral and structural reimagining** of the welfare state. In a world of automation, inequality, and insecurity, UBI could become the **bedrock of a new social contract** — ensuring that *every citizen has the means to live with dignity, autonomy, and stability*.

# Justice in food
---

## **EAT-Lancet Commission Report 2024: Food Systems and Planetary Boundaries**

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

#### **What Are Planetary Boundaries?**

* The **planetary boundaries framework**, introduced by the **Stockholm Resilience Centre (2009)**, identifies **nine biophysical limits** that define a *safe operating space* for humanity.
* **Breaching these limits** leads to irreversible environmental degradation.
* Six of these nine boundaries have already been **crossed** — including those related to **climate change**, **biosphere integrity (biodiversity)**, **land-system change**, **freshwater use**, and **biogeochemical flows** (nitrogen and phosphorus cycles).

#### **The EAT-Lancet Commission**

* The **EAT-Lancet Commission on Healthy, Sustainable, and Just Food Systems (2024)** is a major international scientific collaboration linking **nutrition**, **planetary health**, and **justice**.
* It follows up on the **2019 EAT-Lancet report** (“Food in the Anthropocene”), updating it to reflect the worsening climate, biodiversity, and food system crises.

#### **Core Concept**

* The Commission argues that **global food systems** — from production to consumption — are the **largest single driver of environmental change**, affecting:

  * **Climate change** (GHG emissions)
  * **Biodiversity loss**
  * **Land degradation**
  * **Freshwater use**
  * **Nutrient pollution (nitrogen and phosphorus)**

* Therefore, **transforming food systems** is central to restoring planetary balance while ensuring food and nutrition security.

---

### 2. **The News**

* The **new EAT-Lancet Commission report** highlights that **food systems alone drive five of the six breached planetary boundaries** and produce about **30% of global GHG emissions**.
* **Animal-based foods** are responsible for the majority of agricultural emissions, while **grains dominate nitrogen, phosphorus, and water use**.
* **Agriculture’s nitrogen surplus** — more than **twice the safe planetary limit** — exemplifies unsustainable nutrient flows.
* The report stresses that **only combined, multi-pronged action** can bring global food systems back within safe limits:

  * Reducing **food loss and waste**
  * Improving **agricultural efficiency and sustainability**
  * Encouraging **dietary shifts** toward plant-based foods
  * Reforming **policies and incentives**
* Even with such measures, the Commission warns that food systems will only “**barely return to safety**” by mid-century — particularly in climate and water domains — due to cumulative stress and continued GDP growth assumptions.

#### **India-Specific Findings**

* India’s diet remains **cereal-dominant**, largely due to the **Public Distribution System (PDS)** and **midday meal schemes**.
* Meeting the 2050 sustainability benchmarks will require:

  * Increased consumption of **fruits, vegetables, legumes, and nuts**.
  * Reforms to ensure **affordability and accessibility**, as such foods are costlier and often imported.
* The report notes that **dietary transitions** in India must consider:

  * **Cultural and religious preferences**
  * **Regional cuisine patterns**
  * **Procurement commitments** (e.g., rice and wheat under PDS)
* It advocates **supply-side reforms** — sustainable irrigation, soil restoration, renewable energy in cold chains — rather than imposing “diet-first” transitions that ignore economic realities.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

#### **1. Policy and Legal Framework**

* **National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA):** Promotes resource-efficient technologies and soil health management.
* **National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013:** Ensures subsidised cereals but indirectly perpetuates cereal-heavy diets.
* **PM-KUSUM & Solar Cold Chains:** Encourage renewable energy in agriculture and food logistics.
* **National Nutritional Strategy (NITI Aayog, 2017):** Focuses on diversified and nutritious diets.

#### **2. Environmental and Water Management**

* **National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC):** Includes missions on sustainable habitat, energy, and water use.
* **Jal Shakti Abhiyan:** Focus on water conservation to reduce groundwater depletion.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### **GS Paper III – Environment, Agriculture, and Economy**

##### **Issues and Challenges**

1. **Environmental Overload:**

   * Agriculture responsible for **30% of GHG emissions**, overuse of **fertilisers**, and **groundwater extraction** beyond replenishment.
   * Nitrogen and phosphorus pollution driving **eutrophication** of rivers and lakes.
2. **Dietary Imbalance:**

   * India’s food security framework prioritises calories over nutrition, fostering cereal dependency.
3. **Affordability & Justice:**

   * Healthier foods (fruits, legumes, nuts) often **inaccessible** to poorer households.
   * Diet shifts must not exacerbate inequality or food inflation.
4. **Policy Contradictions:**

   * Agricultural subsidies and procurement incentives for rice and wheat **discourage diversification**.
5. **Corporate Concentration:**

   * Few agro-industrial players dominate seeds, fertilisers, and food retail — limiting equitable reforms.
6. **Cultural Anchors:**

   * Food habits tied to **religion, caste, and convenience** make behaviour change difficult.

##### **Impacts**

* **Ecological:**

  * Breaching planetary boundaries risks **ecosystem collapse** and **nutrient cycle disruption**.
* **Economic:**

  * Long-term soil degradation and water scarcity threaten agricultural productivity.
* **Social:**

  * Rising food costs deepen inequalities and malnutrition.

   * Redesign **PDS and ICDS menus** to include diverse and locally available crops.

3. **Water and Soil Management**

   * Implement **crop rotation** and **rainwater harvesting**.
   * Penalise excessive groundwater extraction and reward conservation.

4. **Institutional and Market Reforms**

   * **Decentralise food systems** to empower small farmers, cooperatives, and women’s groups.
   * Regulate corporate influence and **promote fair pricing mechanisms**.

5. **Behavioural and Fiscal Measures**

   * Use **fiscal tools** to make nutritious foods cheaper and ultra-processed foods costlier.
   * Public campaigns to promote **healthy, sustainable diets**.

6. **Integrated Policy Approach**

   * Align **agriculture, health, and environment ministries** under a unified **National Sustainable Food Systems Policy**.
   * Incorporate **EAT-Lancet benchmarks** into India’s national dietary and climate frameworks.

---

## **Nomination Rejections and Electoral Fairness: The Flaw in India’s Pre-Voting Process**

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

#### **Nomination Process in Indian Elections**

* The **nomination stage** is the *first and most crucial step* in India’s electoral process.
* It is governed by the **Representation of the People Act (RPA), 1951** and the **Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961**.
* The **Returning Officer (RO)** — typically a senior civil servant — is empowered to:

  * Accept or reject candidate nominations.
  * Conduct scrutiny to ensure compliance with the law.
* **Sections 33 to 36 of the RPA** outline nomination requirements, deposits, and scrutiny powers.

#### **Key Provision: Section 36 of RPA, 1951**

* Grants the **RO the power to reject nominations** for “defects of a substantial character.”
* However, there is **no statutory definition** of what counts as a “substantial defect,” giving wide discretionary power.
* **Article 329(b)** of the Constitution prevents judicial review of election-related matters *until after the election* — meaning wrongful rejections can only be challenged *post facto* via an **election petition**.

#### **Result:**

This creates a procedural paradox — **lawful but undemocratic** rejections that eliminate candidates before citizens can even vote.

### 2. **The News**

* A **young woman from Dadra and Nagar Haveli** reported that her father’s **nomination for the municipal council elections** was **rejected without a hearing or verification**, highlighting a systemic flaw.
* The author — a former **Collector and Returning Officer** — acknowledges that such rejections, though unfair, are **technically legal**.
* **Pattern of misuse:**

  * **Bihar (2024):** RJD candidate rejected for leaving blank fields.
  * **Surat (2023):** Opposition candidates’ nominations invalidated over signature denials — resulting in an *unopposed victory*.
  * **Varanasi (2019):** BSF jawan Tej Bahadur Yadav rejected for missing a certificate.
  * **Birbhum (2021):** Former IPS officer Debasish Dhar disqualified over a delayed “no-dues” certificate.
* The **absence of a centralized database** on rejection grounds fosters **opacity** and **potential political manipulation**.
* **Procedural traps** — oath timing, notarization, missing signatures, delayed certificates — act as bureaucratic veto points.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Legal Framework**

#### **1. Statutory Provisions**

* **RPA, 1951:**

  * *Section 33*: Requirements for nomination papers.
  * *Section 34*: Security deposit rules.
  * *Section 36*: Scrutiny and rejection powers of RO.
  * *Section 83*: Content of election petitions.
* **Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961:**

  * Prescribes format (Forms 2A–2E), affidavits, and procedures for scrutiny.

#### **2. Constitutional Provisions**

* **Article 324:** Empowers the Election Commission (ECI) to supervise and control elections.
* **Article 329(b):** Bars judicial intervention during election processes.

#### **3. Election Commission Guidelines**

* **RO Handbook:**

  * Directs officers to use a “checklist” at the time of filing nominations.
  * However, this checklist is *not legally binding* — meaning ROs can later find new “defects” at scrutiny.
* **Affidavit (Form 26):** Mandatory declaration of assets, liabilities, and criminal records — designed for transparency but easily used for technical rejection.

#### **4. Judicial Interpretations**

* **Resurgence India vs. Election Commission (2013):**

  * False declarations → punishable offence.
  * *Incomplete declarations* → nomination rejection.
  * Paradox: dishonesty punished less severely than clerical error.
* **PUCL vs. Union of India (2003):** Introduced mandatory candidate disclosures — increasing paperwork complexity.

##### **Issues and Challenges**

| **Dimension**                  | **Challenge**                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Discretionary Power**        | ROs exercise *unreviewable discretion* in deciding what is “substantial,” enabling arbitrary rejections.            |
| **Procedural Bureaucracy**     | Overemphasis on compliance — minor errors (signatures, oaths, timing) can nullify candidacy.                        |
| **Lack of Transparency**       | No official database on rejected nominations or reasons; fosters suspicion of bias.                                 |
| **Constitutional Gap**         | Judicial redress only post-election; voters lose choice in real time.                                               |
| **Democratic Deficit**         | Rejections undermine the **right to contest** and **right to choose**, both essential for representative democracy. |
| **Weaponisation of Procedure** | Bureaucratic rules used to politically filter candidates rather than facilitate participation.                      |

##### **Impacts**

* **Political:**

  * Distorts electoral competition by eliminating rivals on technical grounds.
  * Erodes **public trust** in electoral fairness.
* **Administrative:**

  * Encourages a “compliance culture” where legality overrides democratic intent.
* **Social:**

  * Weakens citizen participation, particularly for grassroots candidates unfamiliar with legal formalities.
* **Ethical:**

  * Contradicts constitutional morality — prioritizing procedure over representation.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

#### **1. Legal & Procedural Reforms**

* **Codify “Defects of a Substantial Character”:**

  * Parliament should define what constitutes a *substantial defect* to limit arbitrary interpretation.
* **Guarantee Correction Time:**

  * Introduce a **48-hour correction window**, as in **Canada** and **Germany**, for candidates to fix technical errors.
* **Categorize Deficiencies:**

  * (i) *Technical errors* — cannot justify rejection.
  * (ii) *Verification issues* — require investigation.
  * (iii) *Statutory disqualifications* — immediate rejection.
* **Mandatory Reasoned Orders:**

  * ROs must issue written, detailed justifications for every rejection, citing exact legal provisions violated.

#### **2. Administrative Reforms**

* **Digital-by-Default Nomination Portal:**

  * Integrated with voter rolls, Aadhaar, and payment gateways.
  * Auto-validates age, constituency, and affidavits.
  * Tracks real-time status: *filed → verified → deficiency → corrected → accepted/rejected*.
* **Public Dashboard:**

  * Ensures transparency and accountability with timestamps and public access.
* **Training & Accountability:**

  * ROs to undergo ethics and procedure training.
  * Establish **disciplinary oversight** for arbitrary rejections.

#### **3. Conceptual Reform: From Filtration to Facilitation**

* Shift RO’s role from **“gatekeeper”** to **“guide”**.
* Enable pre-scrutiny checks and proactive assistance.
* Institutionalise a **citizen-friendly, error-correction model** instead of a “zero-defect-or-reject” approach.

#### **4. Electoral Data Transparency**

* Election Commission should publish **annual statistics**:

  * Total nominations filed, accepted, rejected.
  * Reasons for rejections.
  * Party-wise and constituency-wise breakdowns.

#### **5. Upholding Democratic Morality**

* The **right to contest elections** flows from **Article 326 (universal suffrage)** and is integral to **democratic participation**.
* Bureaucratic rigidity must not override **citizens’ constitutional agency**.

---

### ✅ **Summary Insight**

India’s **most undemocratic moment** in elections happens *before* voting begins — during nomination scrutiny.
When procedure eclipses participation, **bureaucracy replaces democracy**.
A fair election system must **presume eligibility**, not hunt for disqualification.
Modernising and digitising the nomination process, redefining RO’s powers, and restoring citizen dignity at the entry gate of democracy are vital to ensuring **“facilitation, not filtration.”**
