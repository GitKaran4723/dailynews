# Why is India staring at an obesity challenge?

Earlier this week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his ‘Mann Ki Baat’ radio programme, highlighted the alarming increase in obesity in the country, particularly among children, and noted that obesity affected one in eight Indians. Mr. Modi urged people to reduce oil consumption by 10% each month and stressed that to build a healthy nation, obesity needed to be addressed.

### What is the scale of the problem?

Overweight and obesity are defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that presents a risk to health. Data from the National Family Health Surveys (NFHS) reveals that obesity has been increasing across India over the years. The percentage of women who were overweight/obese grew from 20.6% during NFHS-4 (2015-16) to 24% during NFHS-5 (2019-21). The percentage of overweight/obese men increased from 18.9% to 22.9% during this period. Urban numbers were significantly higher than rural numbers. A 2023 research paper in The Lancet Regional Health Southeast Asia that analysed the NFHS-5 data, found the prevalence of abdominal obesity (assessed through waist circumference) in the country was 40% in women and 12% in men.

Childhood obesity is also an area of concern: the percentage of children under five who were overweight rose from 2.1% to 3.4% from 2015-16 to 2019-21, as per NFHS data. With older children the figures are higher — the World Obesity Atlas 2022 estimates that India will have a child obesity prevalence of 10.81% among 5 to 9-year-olds and 6.23% among 10 to 19-year-olds by 2030.

### What are the health risks?

According to the WHO, obesity in adulthood is a major risk factor for the world’s leading causes of poor health and early death. These include cardiovascular disease, several common cancers, diabetes and osteoarthritis. India leads the world in the number of people with diabetes at an estimated 101 million. The burden of cancer is on the rise; from 14.6 lakh cancer cases in 2022, the number is projected to go up to 15.7 lakh in 2025, as per the Indian Council of Medical Research-National Cancer Registry Programme. Moreover, cardiovascular disease remains one of the leading causes of death and disability, reportedly affecting Indians at least 10 years earlier than in other countries. In fact, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) now account for about 60% of all deaths in India.

Being overweight in childhood and adolescence, the WHO says, affects children’s and adolescents’ immediate health and is associated with greater risk and earlier onset of various NCDs. It can also have adverse psychosocial consequences affecting school performance and quality of life, compounded by stigma, discrimination and bullying. Children with obesity are likely to be adults with obesity.

### Why is obesity on the rise?

“Rising levels of obesity in urban India are due to a combination of multiple factors: unhealthy diets loaded with ultra-processed foods, lowered levels of physical activity and even air pollution which provokes inflammation that predisposes the body to cardio-metabolic diseases and visceral adiposity in the body,” says K. Srinath Reddy, distinguished professor of public health, Public Health Foundation of India.

Cost is another factor. Low-income households, especially those that depend on the public distribution system, eat more carbohydrates through rice and wheat, says public health professional Vandana Prasad. “You can instruct people to eat better, but it is not possible if these foods are unaffordable. Indian diets, especially among poor families, are deficient in iron and proteins. Foods like fruits, vegetables, pulses, dairy and animal-based foods are all expensive. While at present obesity is still primarily an urban, middle class phenomenon in India, it is already rising among the rural poor, which may soon overtake other segments,” she adds.

A study in The Lancet Global Health last year said almost half of all Indians are not sufficiently physically active. “Even as indoor sedentariness is increasing due to the seated nature of office work and use of digital devices, outdoor conditions are not conducive to safe and pleasurable physical activity,” points out Dr. Reddy. The absence of safe cycling lanes and pedestrian paths are compounded by dimly-lit lanes; green spaces available for recreational physical activity are shrinking while traffic density and rising street crime deter walkers in many urban zones.

### Is obesity being measured correctly?

While the usual metric to measure obesity is the Body Mass Index (BMI), there has been a growing debate about its limitations. BMI does not indicate how much of the weight is fat and where the fat is distributed in the body. Fat in the abdomen particularly — something that Indians are genetically predisposed to accumulating — contributes to metabolic syndrome, a group of risk factors that increases the chances of developing type 2 diabetes, stroke and heart disease.

This January, experts in India issued updated guidelines for obesity treatment and diagnosis that placed special emphasis on abdominal fat distribution. The classification introduces two stages in obesity — the first stage where there is increased adiposity without discernible effects on organ functions or daily activities, and the second, where both physical and organ functions are impacted. It recommends the use of waist circumference or waist-to-height ratio and body fat measurements, alongside BMI, to diagnose obesity.

> India is facing a growing **obesity challenge** due to rapid **urbanization**, **sedentary lifestyles**, unhealthy diets rich in **processed and high-calorie foods**, and decreased physical activity. Rising incomes have led to greater consumption of **junk food** and sugary drinks, while screen time has increased, especially among youth. Obesity rates are surging in both **urban and rural areas**, contributing to health issues like **diabetes**, **hypertension**, and **heart disease**. Lack of awareness, poor dietary habits, and limited access to healthy food and exercise facilities worsen the problem. Urgent public health interventions are needed to address this growing crisis.

# Special leave petition was supposed to be narrow-slit: Dhankhar

### **Special Leave Petition (SLP): Complete Explanation**

---

### **1. Definition:**
A **Special Leave Petition (SLP)** is a **constitutional mechanism** through which the **Supreme Court of India** grants special permission to appeal against any judgment or order passed by **any court or tribunal** in the country. It is provided under **Article 136 of the Constitution of India**.

---

### **2. Constitutional Provision:**
- **Article 136** empowers the Supreme Court to grant special leave to appeal from:
  - Any judgment, decree, determination, sentence, or order.
  - Passed by any court or tribunal in India (except military courts).
- This power is **discretionary** and **extraordinary**.

---

### **3. Purpose of SLP:**
- Meant to be an **exceptional remedy** to correct **grave injustices**, **miscarriages of justice**, or **errors of law** that cannot otherwise be rectified through normal appeal processes.
- It was intended as a **“narrow-slit” entry**, meaning it should be used **sparingly**, only in **exceptional circumstances**.

---

### **4. Scope and Usage:**
- Over time, SLPs have become a **widely used tool** to appeal to the Supreme Court, even against orders of High Courts.
- Parties often file SLPs as a **last resort**, making the Supreme Court’s docket very heavy.
- SLPs are **not a matter of right**; they depend entirely on the Supreme Court's discretion.

---

### **5. Grounds for Filing an SLP:**
- Violation of **natural justice**.
- Substantial question of law.
- Gross **miscarriage of justice**.
- Contradictory judgments by different High Courts.
- Abuse of judicial process.

---

### **6. Time Limit to File an SLP:**
- **Against a High Court judgment**: within **90 days**.
- **Against refusal of a High Court certificate of appeal**: within **60 days**.
  
---

### **7. Procedure:**
- Filing of SLP petition with:
  - Facts of the case.
  - Grounds for seeking special leave.
  - Certified copy of the judgment.
- Preliminary hearing to decide **whether to grant leave**.
- If leave is granted, the SLP becomes a **regular appeal**.

---

### **8. Criticism of SLP:**
| Issues                              | Explanation                                  |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Judicial Overload**              | Massive number of SLPs adds to Supreme Court's case backlog. |
| **Dilution of Purpose**            | Used as a regular appeal instead of exceptional remedy. |
| **Accessibility Concerns**         | Supreme Court becoming a “court of ordinary appeal.” |
| **Delays**                         | Routine SLPs consume time meant for constitutional and public interest matters. |

---

### **9. Vice President Dhankhar's Observation:**
- Vice President **Jagdeep Dhankhar** remarked that **SLP was intended as a narrow-slit**, not an open floodgate.
- The original aim was **limited intervention** in rare cases of injustice.
- There is concern that **excessive use of SLPs undermines the federal structure**, burdens the judiciary, and dilutes High Court authority.

---

### **10. Reform Suggestions:**
- **Strict filtering** of SLPs based on merit and importance.
- Encouraging stronger reliance on High Court decisions.
- Prioritizing **constitutional matters** and issues of national significance.
- Streamlining procedures and setting clearer guidelines on what qualifies for an SLP.

---

### **11. Importance of SLP:**

- Corrects **grave legal errors** and **ensures uniformity** of law.
- Protects **fundamental rights** in cases of judicial failure.
- Maintains the **Supreme Court’s supremacy** in interpreting the law of the land.

---

### **12. Conclusion:**
The **Special Leave Petition (SLP)** is a unique and extraordinary judicial tool, designed to uphold justice in **exceptional situations**. However, its **overuse** has raised concerns about the **efficiency of the judiciary**, prompting calls for reforms. Maintaining the **delicate balance** between access to justice and judicial efficiency is crucial to preserving the integrity of the Supreme Court and the Indian judicial system.

> A **Special Leave Petition (SLP)**, under **Article 136** of the Indian Constitution, allows the **Supreme Court** to grant special permission to appeal against judgments of any court or tribunal, except military courts. Intended as an **exceptional remedy** for grave injustice, it was meant to be used sparingly, but over time, its overuse has burdened the Court. **Vice President Dhankhar** highlighted that SLPs were designed as a **"narrow-slit"** entry, not a regular appeal route. Excessive SLPs strain judicial resources, delay important cases, and undermine High Courts, necessitating reforms to restore its original purpose of ensuring justice in rare cases.
