# The dangerous illusion cast by development rankings

California was on fire once again. The recent wildfires were so catastrophic that some estimates placed the total economic damage at around $250 billion, which is an amount rivalling Greece’s GDP in 2023. What the California fires have shown us is the true cost of development models pursued by the world’s richest countries.

If every nation consumed resources at the rate of the United States or the European Union, we would need multiple earths to sustain our way of life. Yet, international benchmarks such as the United Nations’ Human Development Index (HDI) continue to project these nations as aspirational models of development. This disconnect between celebrated metrics and ecological realities is not just flawed. It is dangerous.

### Misguided progress

For decades, the HDI has shaped how countries, including India, perceive progress. The index focuses on three dimensions: life expectancy, education, and income. But it ignores a crucial fourth dimension — the environmental pressures that inevitably accompany high HDI scores. Countries such as Ireland, Norway and Switzerland that top HDI rankings, are among the world’s biggest resource consumers and carbon polluters per person. If their development models were adopted globally, the planet would collapse under the weight of material demands and carbon emissions.

High-income countries have already overshot multiple planetary boundaries, ranging from greenhouse gas emissions and ecological destruction to over-pollution. The HDI’s failure to account for these transgressions promotes a misguided and unsustainable model of development, celebrating the gains of affluence to the few without conceding its cost to the collective. In response to decades of critique from sustainability experts, the UN introduced a modified index in 2020: the Planetary Pressures-adjusted HDI (PHDI). This measure downgrades HDI scores for countries with high environmental impacts. Yet, even the PHDI falls short as it still ranks countries only in relation to one another rather than against absolute ecological limits. For example, the Nordic countries, consuming over five earths’ worth of resources per capita, continue to score highly not because their lifestyles are truly sustainable, but because other nations (such as Qatar) fare even worse.

This relativist approach masks a fundamental reality: the rest of the world cannot scale up to the lifestyle of high-income countries without severely overshooting the planet’s finite limits. In effect, the PHDI engineers a dangerous illusion of progress while perpetuating status quo.

### Celebrate the middle-income countries

Our own research takes a different approach. We ask which countries have achieved decent living standards that could theoretically be scaled globally without driving the planet towards climate and ecological collapse.

Here, middle-income countries such as Costa Rica and Sri Lanka emerge as instructive examples. Costa Rica has achieved impressive outcomes — high life expectancy, universal health care, and near-universal literacy — while maintaining a resource footprint that is far lower than that of affluent nations. Decades of strategic investments in renewable energy and forest conservation have enabled it to align human development with environmental stewardship.

Sri Lanka, meanwhile, offers a mixed picture. With an HDI of 0.78, which is well above many of its South Asian peers, its early investments in universal health care and education have delivered life expectancy and literacy rates comparable to those of wealthier countries. Yet, recent events underscore the many challenges its faces. The 2022 economic crisis, marked by severe inflation, mass protests, and political instability, revealed deep vulnerabilities. Moreover, a legacy of majoritarian policies and ethnic tensions has, at times, led to episodes of severe violence against minorities, stalling their progress. Sri Lanka teaches us that achieving sustainability requires more than balancing environmental and social progress. It demands justice within and between nations.

### India needs to look for alternatives

The lesson is clear: the glittering promise of the Nordic model is, at best, a local phenomenon and, at worst, an unsustainable mirage when applied globally. India, with its 1.4 billion people, cannot afford to mimic the consumption patterns of affluent nations. Instead, it must look to alternatives. While neither Costa Rica nor Sri Lanka is perfect, they offer valuable starting points for crafting an alternative development pathway that respects our planet’s limits and upholds social and ecological justice.

Ultimately, the deeper question we face is to reconceptualise “progress” and “development” in light of the 21st century facts of planetary health. Metrics such as the HDI and PHDI treat growth as an unqualified good, ignoring the limits of a finite planet.

For India, as for the entire developing world, true progress must mean more than GDP growth or higher HDI rankings. It must create a society wherein every citizen lives with dignity and safely within ecological boundaries. This is not just a moral imperative or a utopian dream. It is a necessary strategy for survival in the 21st century.

> Global **development rankings** often create a **misleading perception** of progress, ignoring **deep-rooted inequalities** and **ground realities**. Metrics like **GDP, HDI, and Ease of Doing Business** fail to reflect **social disparities, environmental costs, and quality of life issues**. Countries with high rankings may still face **poverty, unemployment, gender inequality, and lack of access to basic services**. Over-reliance on such rankings can lead to **policy misdirection**, prioritizing **economic growth over sustainable, inclusive development**. A true measure of progress should **focus on human well-being, equity, and sustainability**, rather than **superficial statistical improvements** that mask deeper socio-economic challenges.

# Retail inflation at 7-month low as food prices decline

### **Inflation: Meaning, Causes, Effects, and Control Measures**  

#### **1. What is Inflation?**
Inflation refers to the **general rise in the price levels of goods and services over a period of time**, reducing the purchasing power of money. It is measured as a **percentage increase in the price index** (such as the Consumer Price Index - CPI).

#### **2. Types of Inflation**
1. **Demand-Pull Inflation** – Occurs when demand for goods and services exceeds supply.  
2. **Cost-Push Inflation** – Caused by an increase in production costs (e.g., higher wages, fuel prices).  
3. **Built-in Inflation** – Arises from the expectation of future inflation, leading to wage-price spirals.  
4. **Hyperinflation** – Extremely high and uncontrollable inflation, often seen in war-torn economies.  
5. **Deflation** – The opposite of inflation, where prices decline over time, reducing economic activity.  

#### **3. Measurement of Inflation in India**
- **Consumer Price Index (CPI)** – Measures retail inflation, considering price changes in consumer goods.  
- **Wholesale Price Index (WPI)** – Measures price changes at the wholesale level.  
- **Core Inflation** – Inflation excluding volatile food and fuel prices.  

#### **4. Causes of Inflation**
✔ **Excess demand** – When aggregate demand surpasses supply.  
✔ **Supply chain disruptions** – Natural disasters, wars, or pandemics affecting production.  
✔ **Government policies** – Excess money supply due to deficit financing.  
✔ **Global factors** – Rising crude oil prices, currency depreciation, or trade restrictions.  

#### **5. Effects of Inflation**
✔ **Reduced purchasing power** – Salaries may not keep pace with price hikes.  
✔ **Increase in cost of living** – Essentials like food and fuel become expensive.  
✔ **Erodes savings** – Money loses value over time.  
✔ **Affects investments** – High inflation leads to **higher interest rates**, discouraging borrowing and investments.  
✔ **Hurts fixed-income groups** – Pensioners and low-income earners suffer the most.  

#### **6. Inflation Control Measures**
1. **Monetary Policy (RBI’s Role)**
   - **Increase repo rate** (tightening liquidity).  
   - **Open market operations (OMO)** to absorb excess money.  
   - **CRR & SLR adjustments** to control bank lending.  

2. **Fiscal Policy (Government’s Role)**
   - **Reduce fiscal deficit** by controlling excessive spending.  
   - **Subsidies and tax adjustments** to stabilize prices.  
   - **Supply-side measures** to improve production and reduce bottlenecks.  

3. **Structural Reforms**
   - Enhancing **agriculture productivity** to stabilize food prices.  
   - Promoting **manufacturing & self-reliance** (Aatmanirbhar Bharat).  
   - Strengthening **logistics and supply chains** to reduce cost-push factors.  

#### **7. Current Trend in India (Retail Inflation at a 7-Month Low)**
- **Reason:** Decline in **food prices, especially vegetables and cereals**.  
- **Impact:** Lower inflation **boosts consumer confidence and stabilizes the economy**.  
- **Policy Outlook:** The **RBI may hold or cut interest rates** if inflation remains stable.  

---
### **Conclusion**
✔ **Moderate inflation is necessary** for economic growth, but **high inflation is harmful** to purchasing power and stability.  
✔ **India’s current inflation rate decline is a positive sign**, but sustained control requires **balanced monetary and fiscal policies**.  
✔ **Long-term focus** should be on **agricultural stability, energy security, and manufacturing growth** to maintain price stability.

> **Inflation** refers to the **rise in general price levels**, reducing the purchasing power of money. It is measured using **CPI (Consumer Price Index) and WPI (Wholesale Price Index)**. Inflation can be **demand-pull, cost-push, or structural**. Causes include **excess demand, supply chain disruptions, and global factors like oil prices**. It affects **cost of living, savings, and investments**. **RBI controls inflation** through **monetary policy (repo rate, CRR), while the government uses fiscal measures**. India’s **retail inflation is at a 7-month low due to falling food prices**, improving economic stability. Sustained control requires **structural reforms, better supply chains, and agricultural productivity**.
