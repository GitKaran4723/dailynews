# Long road

### **Analysis of the Issue: "Gender Sensitivity and Institutional Reform for Women in the Workforce"**

---

## **Introduction**

In a society striving towards equality, mere statistical increases in women's participation in the workforce cannot be mistaken for genuine gender justice. True empowerment comes when institutions actively create environments that are sensitive, supportive, and responsive to the unique challenges women face. The recent **Supreme Court judgment** reinstating two women judicial officers who were unfairly dismissed in **Madhya Pradesh** underscores the critical need for systemic reforms and attitudinal change to eliminate entrenched patriarchy from public institutions.

---

## **Context of the Judgment**

- The **Supreme Court of India**, led by **Justice B.V. Nagarathna**, intervened to reverse the termination of two female judicial officers dismissed on grounds of "inefficiency".
- One of the officers had suffered a **miscarriage**, highlighting how a deeply personal and painful experience was ignored by the system in its evaluation of her work.
- The Court termed the dismissal **punitive, arbitrary, and illegal**, emphasizing the **need for gender-sensitive workplaces**, particularly in crucial institutions like the judiciary.
- Justice Nagarathna observed that while the increase in women joining judicial services is welcome, without an enabling atmosphere, such inclusion becomes superficial.

---

## **Key Issues Highlighted**

### 1. **Superficial Celebration vs. Real Inclusion**
- While governments and institutions often celebrate rising numbers of women in service, this does not automatically translate to equality.
- **Token representation** without systemic change only masks deeper discrimination.
  
### 2. **Maternal Rights and Workplace Sensitivity**
- Pregnancy, maternity, and miscarriage are **not just medical events** but deeply impactful life experiences.
- Institutions must recognize and support women through **policies on leave, mental health care, and flexible working conditions**.
- Ignoring these realities perpetuates **structural discrimination**.

### 3. **Entrenched Patriarchy in Institutions**
- The need for the **Supreme Court's intervention** indicates that gender bias is deeply embedded in workplace practices.
- **Performance assessments** often fail to consider the disproportionate burdens carried by women, particularly related to family and health responsibilities.

### 4. **The Importance of Women in Decision-Making**
- More women in leadership positions ensure that policies and workplace cultures become inclusive and responsive.
- Female judges, legislators, and administrators bring **critical perspectives on gendered realities** into law and governance.

### 5. **Legal and Constitutional Safeguards**
- **Right to equality (Article 14)** and **protection against discrimination (Article 15)** are constitutional guarantees.
- **Maternity Benefits Act, 1961** and **Equal Remuneration Act, 1976** provide legal backing, but enforcement remains weak without attitudinal change.

---

## **Broader Implications**

### ✅ **For Institutions**:
- The judiciary, as a **guardian of rights**, must lead by example, ensuring gender-sensitive policies for its officers.
- Workplaces across sectors must proactively **create inclusive environments**, not just comply with minimal legal obligations.

### ✅ **For Society**:
- Gender bias in workplaces reflects wider social prejudices.
- Without dismantling **patriarchal mindsets** in society, institutional reforms alone will have limited impact.

### ✅ **For Policy**:
- Need for **robust maternity policies**.
- Gender audits of workplace practices.
- Institutionalization of **mental health support**, especially for women undergoing trauma like miscarriage.

---

## **The Way Forward**

1. **Policy Reforms**:
   - Strengthening gender-sensitive leave policies.
   - Institutional mechanisms to address gender discrimination.

2. **Representation**:
   - Increasing women's participation in higher positions across the judiciary, legislature, and executive.

3. **Awareness and Training**:
   - Sensitization of officials and co-workers to issues like miscarriage, maternity, and gender-based challenges.

4. **Education and Skill Development**:
   - Ensuring equal opportunities for girls and women from the grassroots to professional levels.

5. **Legal Enforcement**:
   - Strict adherence to constitutional protections and labour laws related to women.

---

## **Conclusion**

The Supreme Court's intervention is a reminder that **gender justice** requires more than mere numbers—it requires **sensitive, thoughtful, and structural changes**. For India to truly aspire to become a developed economy and an egalitarian society, its institutions must shed patriarchal legacies and **walk the talk** on gender equality. Only through **inclusive policies, empathetic leadership, and societal change** can women's rightful place in the workforce and decision-making be secured.

> The Supreme Court's reinstatement of two dismissed women judicial officers highlights the urgent need for gender-sensitive workplaces in India. Justice B.V. Nagarathna emphasized that increasing women's workforce participation is meaningless without ensuring their well-being, particularly regarding maternity rights. The judgment exposes deep-rooted patriarchy in institutions, where personal hardships like miscarriage are overlooked. Genuine gender equality requires more women in decision-making, supportive workplace policies, and societal mindset change. For India to progress as a developed nation, it must go beyond symbolic inclusion and ensure safe, fair, and enabling environments for women across all sectors.

# Centring care in India’s economic policy

The Union Budget for 2025 allocated a record ₹4,49,028.68 crore to the Gender Budget (GB), marking a 37.3% increase from FY24 and accounting for 8.86% of the total Budget. This rise is primarily due to the inclusion of the PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana, which accounts for 24% of the GB, rather than being driven by substantial investments in care infrastructure or new gender-responsive schemes. Despite this increase, critical investments in care infrastructure remain absent, reinforcing the persistent invisibilisation of care work in India’s economic planning. While the Economic Surveys of 2023-24 and 2024-25 highlight care infrastructure as central to women’s empowerment, the current Budget misses the opportunity to make tangible investments to strengthen India’s care economy in line with its socio-economic realities.

Globally, women spend an average of 17.8% of their time on unpaid care and domestic work (UCDW), with women in the Global South bearing higher burdens. India is especially concerning, as Indian women shoulder 40% more of this burden than their counterparts in South Africa and China. The International Labour Organization reports that 53% of Indian women remain outside the labour force due to care responsibilities, compared to just 1.1% of men, underscoring entrenched inequities. For poor and marginalised women, this burden is severe as women in low-income families often juggle 17–19 hours of daily tasks, balancing paid work with domestic duties, intensifying ‘time poverty’, and eroding their well-being.

Feminist economists from the Global South emphasise that unpaid work in these regions encompasses a broader range of tasks compared to the Global North, extending beyond household care giving to include work on family farms, water and fuel collection, cleaning, and cooking. Limited access to essential infrastructure — such as water, clean energy, and sanitation — means women spend up to 73% of their time on these unpaid activities. For example, women spend nearly five hours daily collecting water, compared to 1.5 hours for men. Climate change exacerbates this burden, with water-related unpaid labour in India projected to reach $1.4 billion by 2050 under a high-emissions scenario. This stems from low public investment in care infrastructure and entrenched social norms that assign care work to women.

### Solutions ahead

The Economic Survey 2023-24 highlights that direct public investment equivalent to 2% of GDP could generate 11 million jobs while easing the care burden. Applying the expanded ‘Three R framework’—Recognise, Reduce, Redistribute, and Represent — can ensure policies are both contextually relevant and transformative. The first step is recognising the full spectrum of UCDW women perform. India’s 2019 Time Use Survey marked a milestone in acknowledging this issue, revealing that women spend an average of seven hours daily on UCDW. Despite the policy benefits that these surveys carry, their costs can make implementation challenging. One solution is to integrate Time-use modules into existing household surveys.

The second step is reducing the UCDW burden through time-saving technologies and expanded access to affordable care infrastructure. The Centre has acknowledged gaps in access to essential services by extending the Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) until 2028, aiming for 100% potable water coverage. However, funding delays and underutilisation hinder implementation. While the scheme’s Budget declined by 4.51% from last year’s Budget Estimates (BE), it saw a 195% jump over Revised Estimates (RE), highlighting allocation-spending gaps. With less than half of villages having functional household tap connections, JJM requires stronger implementation and water sustainability measures.

Expanding childcare centres, eldercare support, and assistive technologies would ease women’s care burden, and boost their workforce participation.

The third key step is redistributing care work — from the home to the State and within households. The newly announced ₹1 lakh crore Urban Challenge Fund, with ₹10,000 crore allocated for FY 2025-26, can be transformative. This will finance up to 25% of bankable projects, encouraging private and public sector participation in urban redevelopment, water, and sanitation initiatives. By leveraging this fund, India can scale up pilot care infrastructure models already under way through the Smart Cities Mission. Taking inspiration from Bogotá’s Care Blocks, which centralise care giving services to reduce women’s unpaid work, this approach aligns with the fund’s broader goal of sustainable urban development.

Finally, women’s representation in decision-making and implementation is crucial for creating gender-transformative policies. Excluding women from this leaves them vulnerable to policies that fail to address their lived realities. In fact, involving women in decision-making processes enhances their effectiveness significantly, sometimes by six to seven times.

With the Centre’s emphasis on Nari Shakti as a driver of economic growth, India has the opportunity to set a global example for a gender and care-sensitive economy. However, the current Budget falls short by not prioritising care as a central pillar. A more deliberate, well-funded strategy is necessary to ensure that care work is not treated as an afterthought but as a core component of inclusive growth.

> Centring **care work** in India's economic policy is essential for inclusive and sustainable growth. Unpaid and underpaid care work, mostly performed by **women**, supports the economy but remains invisible in policy and GDP calculations. Prioritizing care through investments in **healthcare, childcare, elderly care**, and **social protection** can reduce gender inequalities, enhance productivity, and create employment. As India aims for economic development, recognizing care as a core economic activity is vital for achieving **gender equity**, improving **human capital**, and ensuring **social well-being**, making growth more **humane, equitable, and resilient** in the long run.
