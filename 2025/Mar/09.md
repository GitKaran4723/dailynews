# More women should be part of workforce: Murmu

### Women’s Participation in Workforce: A Key to India’s Economic Growth

On the occasion of **International Women’s Day**, President **Droupadi Murmu** emphasized the crucial role of **women’s workforce participation** in India's journey toward becoming the **third-largest economy**. Speaking at the **national conference** on the theme *‘Nari Shakti Se Viksit Bharat’* (Developed India through the Development of Women), organized by the **Union Ministry of Women and Child Development**, she underlined that a **higher rate of female labor force participation** is necessary for India's **holistic and sustainable economic growth**.

### **India’s Economic Growth and Women’s Workforce Participation**
India is currently the **fifth-largest economy** in the world and is expected to surpass **Germany and Japan** to become the **third-largest economy** in the coming years. However, despite significant **economic progress**, the **low female workforce participation rate (FLFPR)** remains a major concern. According to the **World Bank**, India's **female labor force participation** was **only around 24% in 2022**, significantly lower than the global average of **around 47%**.

If India aspires to become a **global economic powerhouse**, **gender inclusivity in the workforce** is essential. **Women’s active participation in economic activities** leads to **higher GDP growth**, **poverty reduction**, and **overall social development**. Studies indicate that increasing **women’s participation** in the economy could **boost India’s GDP by nearly 27%**.

### **Challenges to Women’s Workforce Participation in India**
Despite having a large **female population** and increasing **literacy rates**, several barriers hinder **women’s workforce participation** in India. Some of the key challenges include:

1. **Social and Cultural Norms**: Patriarchal attitudes often discourage **women from working** outside their homes. Household responsibilities and **childcare duties** disproportionately fall on women, limiting their career opportunities.

2. **Workplace Discrimination**: Women often face **gender-based discrimination**, **wage gaps**, and **glass ceiling effects**, making it difficult for them to advance in their careers.

3. **Safety and Security Concerns**: Lack of **safe transportation**, inadequate **women-friendly workplaces**, and rising cases of **harassment and violence** deter women from joining or continuing in the workforce.

4. **Lack of Skill Development**: While more women are enrolling in **higher education**, **skill development programs** tailored to industry needs are still inadequate.

5. **Informal Sector Dominance**: A majority of working women in India are engaged in the **informal sector**, where they face **low wages**, **job insecurity**, and **lack of social security benefits**.

### **Government Initiatives to Improve Women’s Workforce Participation**
Recognizing these challenges, the **Government of India** has introduced various initiatives to **empower women** economically:

- **Beti Bachao Beti Padhao**: Encourages **education for girls** to improve their **employability**.
- **Skill India Mission**: Provides **vocational training** and **skill development programs** to enhance women’s employment opportunities.

# 100-day TB elimination campaign far from achieving main objective.

# **Tuberculosis (TB) in India: Challenges and Elimination Efforts**

Tuberculosis (**TB**) remains a **major public health challenge** in India, despite continuous government efforts to eliminate the disease. India has the **highest TB burden in the world**, accounting for nearly **27% of global TB cases**, as per the **World Health Organization (WHO)**. Recognizing this, the Government of India launched an ambitious **100-day TB elimination campaign** to accelerate progress toward **ending TB by 2025**, five years ahead of the global **2030 target**. However, recent reports indicate that the campaign is far from achieving its main objectives.

## **Understanding Tuberculosis (TB)**
TB is an **infectious bacterial disease** caused by *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, primarily affecting the **lungs** (pulmonary TB) but can also affect other parts of the body (extrapulmonary TB). It spreads through the **air** when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks. Common **symptoms** include:
- **Chronic cough (lasting more than 2 weeks)**
- **Blood in sputum**
- **Weight loss**
- **Fever and night sweats**
- **Fatigue and weakness**

There are **two types** of TB infections:
1. **Latent TB** – The bacteria remain in the body without causing symptoms.
2. **Active TB** – The infection spreads, causing symptoms and becoming contagious.

## **India’s Burden of TB**
India has the world’s **largest TB burden**, with around **2.8 million cases annually**. The disease is a leading cause of **morbidity and mortality**, especially among **low-income populations**. Several factors contribute to TB’s prevalence in India:
- **Overcrowding and poor sanitation** in urban slums
- **Malnutrition**, making individuals more vulnerable
- **HIV co-infection**, increasing the risk of developing TB
- **Delayed diagnosis and treatment**
- **Multi-Drug Resistant TB (MDR-TB)** due to incomplete or improper treatment

## **Government’s TB Elimination Initiatives**
To combat TB, the Indian government launched the **National TB Elimination Programme (NTEP)** under the **National Health Mission (NHM)**. Key initiatives include:
1. **Ni-Kshay Poshan Yojana** – Provides **₹500 per month** to TB patients for **nutritional support**.
2. **Ni-Kshay Mitra Initiative** – Encourages individuals and organizations to support TB patients with food, medicines, and counseling.
3. **Active Case Finding (ACF)** – Door-to-door screenings for early detection.
4. **Universal Drug-Susceptibility Testing (UDST)** – Ensures proper TB diagnosis and drug-resistant TB management.
5. **100-Day TB Elimination Campaign** – Aimed at **accelerating case detection, increasing awareness, and providing free treatment**.

## **Challenges in TB Elimination**
Despite these efforts, several challenges persist:
- **Missed cases** due to poor healthcare access in rural areas
- **Stigma** preventing patients from seeking timely care
- **MDR-TB cases rising**, making treatment more complex
- **Weak surveillance and reporting systems**
- **Lack of awareness**, especially among marginalized communities

## **Way Forward**
To achieve TB elimination, India must:
- **Strengthen healthcare infrastructure** and ensure universal access to TB care.
- **Expand awareness programs** to reduce stigma and improve early detection.
- **Enhance research and development** for more effective TB vaccines.
- **Increase funding and partnerships** for sustained TB control efforts.

### **Conclusion**
India’s **100-day TB elimination campaign** was a step in the right direction but has fallen short of its primary objectives. A more **sustained and comprehensive approach** is required to eliminate TB by 2025. Achieving this goal will require **strong government policies, community participation, and global collaboration** to ensure a **TB-free India**.

> **Tuberculosis (TB)** remains a major public health challenge in **India**, with the country accounting for **27% of global TB cases**. The government launched the **100-day TB elimination campaign** as part of its goal to **eradicate TB by 2025**, but progress has been slow. Challenges such as **missed cases, stigma, drug-resistant TB, and inadequate healthcare access** hinder efforts. While initiatives like **Ni-Kshay Poshan Yojana** and **active case detection** help, a **sustained approach** is needed. Strengthening **healthcare infrastructure, awareness, research, and funding** is crucial to achieving a **TB-free India** and meeting the ambitious **elimination target**.

# How is a census of river dolphins carried out?

The first ever census of Gangetic dolphins, the only riverine dolphins in India, which began four years ago, has found 6,327 of the species in the river Ganga and its tributaries.

### What did the census survey find?

The Environment Ministry on March 3, commemorated as World Wildlife Day, released a report by the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), a Ministry body, that said there are 6,324 Ganges river dolphins, and three Indus river dolphins (a related species). There are an average 3,275 dolphins in the main stem of the Ganga; 2,414 in the Ganga tributaries; 584 in the Brahmaputra mainstream; 51 in the Brahmaputra tributaries; and three dolphins in the river Beas. The effort began in 2021 and spanned a cumulative distance of 8,507 km along the stretches of the river and its tributaries. The maximum number of dolphins were reported in Uttar Pradesh (2,397), followed by Bihar (2,220), West Bengal (815) Assam (635) Jharkhand (162) Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh (95) and Punjab (3).

### Why was such a survey necessary?

River dolphins grow slowly and are found in some of the most threatened habitats, vulnerable particularly to getting entangled in the nets of fishermen. Project Dolphin was launched on August 15, 2020 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to evolve a programme to conserve both marine and riverine dolphins by engaging multiple stakeholders such as the forest department, fishermen, fisheries department. In all, 58 rivers were surveyed, of which 28 were traversed by boat and 30 by road survey where Gangetic dolphins have been sighted historically.

### How was the survey conducted?

Nearly all wild animals that are surveyed from time to time are land animals. Observational techniques and statistical modelling methods have evolved over the years to estimate their numbers using camera traps, line transects, tracking their excreta, pug marks, traces of their DNA. However, dolphins present a unique challenge. They are primarily under water animals, and emerge for air only for seconds. This leaves very little time for an observer to characterise them. Being water-borne, they don’t leave traceable biological samples that can be collected for analysis. This doesn’t mean that wildlife research scientists haven’t attempted to count them. The number of Ganges river dolphins have been estimated to be between 4,000 and 5,000 towards the end of the 20th century. This dropped to 1,800, according to a 2008 study. More recent studies estimate it to be between 3,500 and 4,500 though these are said to be “guesstimates,” and primarily based on counting the number of dolphins seen from a boat on pre-defined stretches. For the Project Dolphin survey, the scientists used a combination of “visual and acoustic surveys.” Here, two teams of observers on a boat, coasting at a constant speed, independently recorded a dolphin sighting. Every time they sighted a dolphin, they noted the distance of the sighting from their boat, whether the animals were adults or ‘neonates’, and whether it was the same dolphin sighted before. Then, these observations were correlated with an acoustic survey. Dolphins are largely blind and communicate via sounds, or echo-location like bats. Scientists used a hydrophone, or an underwater microphone, that can record these sounds. Using signal processing, it is possible to identify with a fairly high accuracy, unique individuals, the WII report said. For their final assessments, results from both these methods were combined with mathematical techniques.

### What are the threats faced by the dolphins?

Accidental deaths from being entangled in fishing nets are a major threat. Unlike in poaching, where certain animals are actively hunted, dolphins wade into these nets and are unable to free themselves to break into the surface for air and are thus suffocated. Large-meshed gillnets made from nylon and polythene monofilament are particularly dangerous for them, says a report from the Wildlife Conservation Trust of India (WCT). According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List, the Ganges river dolphin (Platanista gangetica) are classified as ‘Endangered.’ Studies estimate that 4%-5% of dolphins die this way. The WCT report, however, mentions that there have been instances where the dolphins, once caught in these nets, are sometimes “opportunistically killed.” The oil extracted from their fat, or blubber, is used as a bait in India and Bangladesh for catching catfish.

> The **census of river dolphins** is conducted using the **direct count method**, primarily through **boat-based surveys** along river stretches. Researchers use the **visual encounter survey method**, where trained observers record dolphin sightings while navigating at a consistent speed. The **"double observer method"** helps reduce counting errors. **Acoustic monitoring** using hydrophones detects dolphins underwater, especially in turbid rivers. The census considers **habitat conditions, water flow, and seasonal variations**. India's **Gangetic dolphin census** follows these techniques in rivers like the **Ganga, Brahmaputra, and their tributaries**. The data helps in **conservation efforts** and assessing population trends of these endangered species.

# Why are Indian firms racing to build local AI?

On March 6, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology’s IndiaAI Mission launched AI Kosha, a national dataset platform that will gather non-personal data from various ministries and departments in order to develop Artificial Intelligence models and tools. It also launched the Common Compute portal to allow startups and academia to access a shared pool of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to build and run AI models and tools.

### What is the IndiaAI Mission?

The IndiaAI portal was initially set up as a joint initiative between the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology and the Indian tech industry association Nasscom in 2023. The portal has evolved into a mission led entirely by the Union government, announced last March with an outlay of ₹10,371.92 crore. The mission was approved by the Union Cabinet amid the rapid proliferation and development of generative AI models like ChatGPT and an increased global enthusiasm to develop AI. The key objectives of the mission were: “Making AI in India and Making AI Work for India”.

While the mission works on many interventions and resources for private companies and academia to research and build AI, a key one that has emerged in recent weeks has been the Common Compute facility to provide GPUs to startups that may not be able to buy them independently in a large volume.

GPUs, also known as graphics cards, are a key component in many PCs and phones that allow these devices to render images and graphics. However, AI researchers have long used GPUs to run enormously complex calculations involving massive volumes of data. Generative AI models, which can only be created (“trained”) and run when they have access to such computing resources, have become a major use case of GPUs. This is what has enabled firms like Nvidia to foray far beyond video gaming to become an essential component of AI infrastructure around the world. However, GPUs are expensive. Blackwell, a GPU made by Nvidia, is reportedly sold out until this October. As such, the IndiaAI Mission has started empanelling data centres in India that have GPUs to provide access to their computing resources to startups and researchers. This access will be handled by the mission, which will decide which entities will get how much computing resource access, and for how long. As of now, 14,000 GPUs have been acquired and commissioned for use by empanelled data centres so far, according to IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, with more to be acquired on a quarterly basis.

### What is AI Kosha?

AI Kosha is the implementation of another pillar of the mission: the IndiaAI Datasets Platform. One of the main issues with building AI models from scratch — or to some extent even adapting existing models to India — is that they are largely trained on Western models that are heavily biased towards English and developed countries. The fact that many internet users are navigating the web and contributing to discussions online in English even if it is not their main language in India — as The Hindu has reported — has been a major challenge in putting together such data. The AI Kosha is the beginning of an attempt, therefore, to make India-specific data much more widely available. The datasets that have so far been uploaded — such as translation models between several “pairs” of Indian languages — are an effort to diminish this bias by giving researchers and firms building AI tools in India wider access to local content.

Many open source AI models would theoretically allow an Indian firm to build their own powerful generative AI tools, such as chatbots. But local data, policymakers and developers have argued, are critical to ensure that such deployments are actually useful over what foreign firms like OpenAI and Google already offer.

### What else does the IndiaAI Mission work on?

The mission has seven pillars overall. While the Common Compute facility and AI Kosha have been under particular focus due to developments like DeepSeek — the Chinese AI model that was trained at a far lower cost than competing models from the U.S. — there are other aspects that policymakers have targeted.

One is the AI Safety Institute of India, which is yet to be formally launched. Such institutes are being created or accredited around the world to develop guardrails around unintended consequences of AI deployments, and to study the risks of the mushrooming use of AI across the industry and government. These include everything from making sure that a chatbot doesn’t give away a recipe for a bomb (for example), to making sure that specialised AI tools, like those used in biomedical research, are reliable and can “explain” their output.

Other pillars include the IndiaAI Innovation Centre, which aims to create “domain-specific foundation models”; an application development initiative to help develop use-cases that can be commercialised or put to productive use; Futureskills, an initiative to develop AI labs in smaller cities; and startup financing.

A key effort that dovetails with many of these pillars is the request for proposals put out by the mission to develop an indigenously developed foundation model. Building a foundational model — the main program that a generative AI tool runs on — is highly resource-intensive and accounts for the bulk of developing AI models. The Union government is keen on facilitating this process in a matter of months, Mr. Vaishnaw has said, and 67 applications have already been received by the mission, which is evaluating these at present.

> Indian firms are racing to build **local AI** to reduce **dependency on foreign technology**, enhance **data security**, and cater to **India-specific needs**. The push is driven by **government initiatives**, rising **demand for AI solutions**, and the need for **vernacular language support**. Companies aim to develop **homegrown AI models** to compete globally, improve **efficiency in sectors like healthcare, finance, and agriculture**, and ensure **affordable AI solutions**. Additionally, concerns over **data privacy, regulatory policies, and geopolitical factors** are accelerating local AI development. Investments in **AI startups, cloud computing, and semiconductor infrastructure** are further fueling India's **AI innovation ecosystem**.
