# Closing the gender gap in the higher judiciary

Women in law have seen great progress over the last 100 years in India. The first woman lawyer, Cornelia Sorabji, was entitled to practice in 1924. Since then, the number of women lawyers has increased, several women have been designated Senior Advocates, and there have been many women judges in the lower judiciary.

### Inequality at the top

However, there remains a glass ceiling for women in the higher judiciary. The share of women judges in the High Courts is only 14.27% (109 out of 764). In eight High Courts, the number of woman judges is limited to just one. The High Courts of Uttarakhand, Meghalaya, and Tripura have no woman judge. The Allahabad High Court, which is the largest High Court in the country with 79 judges at present, has only three women judges (2%). Not only is there a disproportionately low number of women judges in the High Courts, but they are also appointed later than men. The average age of appointment of men is 51.8 years, but for women it is 53 years. Thus, women judges do not reach positions of seniority. Out of 25 High Courts, only the Gujarat High Court has a woman Chief Justice.

The numbers for the Supreme Court are much worse, with only two women judges serving at present — Justice B.V. Nagarathna and Justice Bela Trivedi. With Justice Bela Trivedi due to retire in June 2025, the top Court will be left with just one woman judge. The last woman judge appointed to the Supreme Court was in 2021. Since then, 28 judges have been appointed to the Supreme Court, and not a single of them is a woman. Over the last 75 years, the Supreme Court has elevated nine men from the Bar directly to the Supreme Court, but only one woman has been elevated directly from the Bar to the Court.

Many justifications are given for not appointing women. It is said that there are not enough eligible women candidates, not enough women with seniority, or that women do not want to become judges. All of this is merely top dressing, when the underlying factor is one of deep inequality, to borrow the analogy of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar. One of the main causes for the exclusion of women from the higher judiciary is deep-rooted and systemic inequality, where women are seen as inferior within the legal profession. Women lawyers nominated for judgeship face heightened scrutiny. Far from compromising on merit, women are almost always required to prove merit more than men.

We also have the collegium system of appointments, which is opaque and non-transparent. There are no clearly stated criteria for eligibility or merit and there is no transparency in the process. This also works against women. The collegiums almost always comprise men and little or no effort is taken to get names of meritorious women lawyers for elevation. This is not the only hurdle. Even when names of women are recommended by the collegium, women are disproportionately not confirmed by the government. Since 2020, nine women’s names were recommended by the collegium for appointment to the High Courts, but were not confirmed. Of these, five were the only names to be rejected.

This year, as we celebrate International Women’s Day and 75 years of the Supreme Court, we need a transformation of our courts. Constitutional courts have to be gender equal in the true sense, where women are working, serving and leading in equal measure, especially on the Bench.

### Steps towards equality

Women’s representation in the judiciary is key to ensuring that courts represent their citizens and hand down sound judgments. Having an equal number of women on the Bench will enhance the legitimacy of courts and give a signal that our judiciary is inclusive and representative of the people whose lives they affect.

First, the collegium could frame a transparent process and provide clear criteria for appointment. This must include a process for lawyers to express interest in being considered for appointment, such as through applications. There must be clear criteria based on the highest standards of excellence and integrity, and a specified time frame during which the recommendations be made.

Second, there has to be a focus on gender diversity while making appointments. Diversity and merit are not contradictory; rather, in a pluralistic society such as ours, diversity makes the judiciary more representative, thus fostering impartiality and enhancing the moral legitimacy of the institution. There is, at present, a clear consideration of State-wise representation of judges, as well as of caste and religion. Gender diversity also needs to be taken into account to ensure that at least one-third of our higher judiciary, if not half, is composed of women.

This will mandate the appointment of a competent, independent, and impartial judiciary capable of upholding constitutionalism and the rule of law in the country, through a process that ensures selections solely based on merit and encourages diversity in the range of persons appointed, so as to enhance public confidence in the institution. Most importantly, gender balance needs to be a stated objective of the judiciary in making appointments.

Justice Indira Banerjee, a former judge of the Supreme Court, famously said in one of her interviews that she did not want any fanfare when she was appointed just because she was a woman. We have to ensure that women’s appointments to the Supreme Court and High Courts are so normalised that it does not seem out of the ordinary at all.

> **Closing the gender gap in India’s higher judiciary** is crucial for ensuring **equal representation, fairness, and diverse perspectives** in legal decision-making. Despite growing female participation in law, **women remain underrepresented** in the Supreme Court and High Courts due to **structural barriers, biases, and lack of representation in senior positions**. Bold reforms, including **reservation in judicial appointments, mentorship programs, gender-sensitive policies, and transparent selection processes**, are needed. Strengthening **legal education for women, addressing workplace discrimination, and ensuring equal opportunities** can create a **more inclusive judiciary**, enhancing justice delivery and reinforcing **gender equality in India's legal system**.

# The empowerment of India’s women with bold policies

In the context of **International Women’s Day on March 8**, it is pertinent to note that India is making notable strides in empowering women, with government policies playing a crucial role in transforming women’s access to sanitation, clean water, financial inclusion, and entrepreneurship. These initiatives, paired with broader social and economic changes, are reshaping women’s roles in governance, in the workforce, and community leadership across the country.

### On sanitation and clean water missions

The journey towards women’s empowerment in India took a significant step forward with the launch of the **Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Mission)**, an initiative that was aimed not just at building toilets but also at improving the dignity, the safety and the well-being of women across the country. The mission focused on ending open defecation, especially in rural areas, where women faced heightened risks and challenges. According to government data, over 116 million households have benefited from the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM), leading to safer, healthier environments and giving women greater freedom and security in their daily lives.

In Rourkela, the **Maa Tarini Self-Help Group (SHG)** took the initiative to address the sanitation needs of leprosy patients, a marginalised group often excluded from such efforts. By constructing community toilets with enhanced water supply, they provided a safer space for women, improved menstrual hygiene, and promoted dignity. The initiative also incorporated composting activities, generating income for the community while supporting sustainable waste management practices.

Building on the SBM’s success, the **Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM)** was introduced to ensure that every household had access to safe and reliable drinking water. Prior to the mission, only 17% of India’s rural households had tap water connections, leading to long hours spent by women fetching water — time that could have been used for education, work, or other pursuits. With the JJM, over 150 million households now have tap water, helping to lighten the daily burdens that women face.

The benefits extend far beyond convenience. Studies show that access to water has led to a 7.4% increase in women’s participation in agriculture and allied work, particularly in States such as Bihar and Jharkhand, where female labour force participation was historically low. Between 2017 and 2023, rural female participation in the workforce jumped from 24.6% to 41.5%, with the JJM cited as a key driver of this positive change. By freeing women from the daily chore of water collection, this initiative is unlocking new opportunities for economic independence and helping local economies thrive.

India’s efforts in empowering women through targeted policies and initiatives are not just improving daily life. They are also creating a foundation for future progress. With continued focus on accessible resources, financial inclusion, and breaking down social barriers, India is paving the way for a generation of women to lead and succeed in every area of life.

### Women-led businesses, financial inclusion

India’s economic transformation is increasingly being shaped by women entrepreneurs and financial inclusion initiatives, reflecting broader shifts in digital access, policy support, and economic empowerment.

Over 73,000 startups with at least one female director have been recognised under the Startup India Initiative, highlighting a growing presence of women in business leadership. Government-backed financing programmes, such as the Stand-Up India Scheme and Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, have played a key role in this expansion. The Stand-Up India Scheme has sanctioned over ₹53,609 crore in loans for 236,000 entrepreneurs, while Mudra Yojana has sanctioned ₹32.36 lakh crore for 51.41 crore loans, with 68% of the loans going to women.

The rapid expansion of digital connectivity is also enabling greater financial inclusion. Initiatives such as **BharatNet** and the **Prime Minister Wi-Fi Access Network Interface (PM-WANI)** have brought high-speed Internet to 199,000 villages and 2,14,000 gram panchayats, with over 2,47,000 Wi-Fi hotspots established. These digital advancements are giving women greater access to banking services, e-commerce platforms, and business opportunities. Under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, more than 300 million bank accounts have been opened for women, fostering financial independence and economic participation.

Women-led enterprises are also making inroads into e-commerce and government procurement. On the **Government e-Marketplace (GeM)** portal, women entrepreneurs now make up 8% of the total seller base, with over 1,00,000 Udyam-verified micro and small enterprises (MSEs) securing contracts worth ₹46,615 crore.

Digital platforms are proving to be game changers for small-scale women entrepreneurs. Reena Kirar, an entrepreneur from Madhya Pradesh, runs the Girja Devi Jan Kalyan Samiti, a self-help group producing clothing, food products, and household goods. By leveraging the GeM portal, her business expanded beyond local markets, illustrating how technology is bridging the gap between small enterprises and national opportunities.

As India’s economy continues to grow, women-led businesses are playing an increasingly significant role, not just in entrepreneurship but also in reshaping the country’s economic landscape.

### Women’s representation in governance

The representation of women in political decision-making has significantly increased over the years. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India has witnessed significant reform, i.e., the implementation of a 33% reservation for women in legislative bodies, which will redefine the corridors of power. Today, women are not merely participants. They are key decision-makers, steering the nation toward a more inclusive future.

At the grassroots level, women have become catalysts for growth, constituting approximately **46% of elected representatives in panchayati raj institutions (PRIs)**, with over 1.4 million women serving in rural governance roles. The impact of this shift transcends mere numbers. With more women in leadership positions, policies have become more attuned to the priorities of families and communities. Areas such as health care, education, and public safety have seen significant improvements, driven by the unique perspectives and solutions that women leaders bring to the table. This evolution in leadership highlights a broader discourse: when women lead, societies thrive. India’s commitment to empowering women in governance not only strengthens democracy but also paves the way for sustainable development and social equity.

India has seen significant progress in women’s participation across various sectors, from **science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)** and sports to governance and entrepreneurship. Today, women make up nearly 43% of STEM graduates, contributing to the country’s growing technical workforce. In 2023, Mr. Modi aptly stated at the G-20 Ministerial Conference on Women Empowerment, “When women prosper, the world prospers.” By empowering women through entrepreneurship, education, and financial inclusion, we unlock new opportunities for growth, innovation, and societal progress, driving global transformation. Policies supporting women-led businesses, political representation, and skill development continue to shape economic and social progress. The focus now is on sustaining this momentum, ensuring that progress translates into lasting change for future generations.

> The **empowerment of India’s women** requires **bold policies** that promote **education, economic independence, safety, and equal rights**. Initiatives like **Beti Bachao Beti Padhao, Ujjwala Yojana, and MUDRA loans** support women’s welfare, while **reservation in politics and workforce participation schemes** enhance gender equality. Legal reforms against **domestic violence, workplace harassment, and child marriage** ensure safety and dignity. The **National Education Policy (NEP) 2020** emphasizes **women’s higher education** and skill development. To achieve true empowerment, India must enforce **strict policy implementation, promote financial independence, and challenge societal norms**, ensuring women’s **active participation in decision-making and nation-building**.
