### **Key Concerns**  
| Issue                         | Explanation                                  |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Sectoral Concentration**    | Heavy lending to sectors like real estate, which are cyclical and high-risk. |
| **Liquidity Risks**           | NBFCs depend heavily on short-term borrowings to fund long-term loans, creating cash flow mismatches. |
| **Systemic Risk**             | Failure of large NBFCs can impact banks, mutual funds, and overall credit markets. |
| **Shadow Banking Concerns**   | NBFCs operate with lighter regulation than banks, increasing the risk of unchecked growth. |
| **Credit Growth Surge**       | Aggressive lending post-COVID may lead to rising **Non-Performing Assets (NPAs)** if economic conditions worsen. |

---

### **Impact on Financial Stability**
- Rising defaults in overexposed NBFCs can trigger a **credit crunch**.
- **Banking sector exposure** to NBFCs (through loans and investments) may lead to **contagion effects**.
- Investor confidence in financial markets can decline, affecting **capital flows**.
- Higher risk for **retail borrowers** and **small businesses**, who depend on NBFC funding.

---

### **Suggested Measures**  
1. **Stronger Regulation**: RBI must increase scrutiny over NBFCs’ sectoral exposure limits.
2. **Liquidity Management**: Ensure robust frameworks to manage asset-liability mismatches.
3. **Risk-Based Supervision**: Focus on large, systemically important NBFCs (NBFC-SI).
4. **Capital Buffers**: Mandate higher capital adequacy for NBFCs with aggressive growth.
5. **Transparency**: Improve disclosure norms for lending practices and risk assessments.
6. **Stress Testing**: Regular financial health checks for NBFCs to predict potential crises.

# ‘Blue Ghost moon landing part of U.S. plan to dominate space’

### **Firefly Aerospace's Successful Moon Landing: A Milestone in Private Lunar Exploration**

On **Sunday**, **Firefly Aerospace**, a U.S.-based private space company, achieved a remarkable feat by successfully landing its **uncrewed Blue Ghost spacecraft** on the Moon. This marked Firefly's first-ever attempt at a lunar landing and represents a significant step forward in the growing competition among private companies striving to become key players in the new era of the **global lunar race**. As global interest in lunar exploration intensifies, Firefly's achievement is a milestone, not only for commercial spaceflight but also for scientific research and technological advancement.

The **Blue Ghost lander**, approximately the size of a compact car and designed with four sturdy legs, made a smooth touchdown at **0835 GMT (1405 IST)**. The landing site was near an ancient volcanic feature on **Mare Crisium**, a large, circular basin located on the **northeastern part of the Moon's near side**, visible from Earth. **Mare Crisium**, meaning "Sea of Crises," is believed to have formed billions of years ago from volcanic activity and has been a region of interest due to its unique geological features.

Carrying **10 scientific payloads**, Blue Ghost's mission is planned to last around **two weeks** during the lunar day, as the lander is not designed to withstand the extreme cold of the lunar night. These payloads, developed by **NASA** and other research organizations, will conduct various scientific experiments.

# What are the issues around delimitation?

There has been a renewed debate about delimitation after the issue was raised by the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. The delimitation of constituencies for the Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies is to be carried out on the basis of the first Census after 2026.

### What are constitutional provisions?

Delimitation means the process of fixing the number of seats and boundaries of territorial constituencies in each State for the Lok Sabha and Legislative assemblies. This exercise is performed by the ‘Delimitation Commission’ that is set up by an act of Parliament. Such an exercise was carried out based on the 1951, 1961 and 1971 Census. The number of seats in the Lok Sabha, based on the 1971 Census, was fixed at 543, when the population was 54.8 crore. However, since then, it has been frozen in order to encourage population control measures. This number is to be readjusted based on the first Census after 2026. As the 2021 Census that was originally postponed due to COVID-19 is yet to commence, there have been debates linking it to the ensuing delimitation.

### What are the issues?

The population explosion that happened in our country during the last five decades has been uneven with some States like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan having a greater increase than States like Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. There are two scenarios that are being discussed with respect to the revised delimitation exercise.

The first is to continue with the existing 543 seats and their redistribution amongst various States (Exhibit 1). The second is to increase the number of seats to 848, with proportionate increase among various States (Exhibit 2). Home Minister Amit Shah stated in a recent public meeting that the number of seats will not be reduced for any State and that it would be increased on a ‘pro-rata’ basis for all States including the southern States. The basis for this ‘pro-rata’ share for States — whether it will be based on the existing percentage in the share of seats or on projected population — is not clear.

As per Exhibit 2 which is based on projected population, it is evident that southern States, smaller States in the north like Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, as well as the northeastern States are bound to be at a disadvantage when compared to the larger northern States. This may go against the ‘basic structure’ of federalism in our polity. It will lead to a feeling of disenchantment in the States that stand to lose in their proportional representation, and thereby political significance, despite controlling their population.

Southern States that have a 24% share in the number of seats at present would see it decline by 5%.

### What can be a solution?

‘Democracy’ means ‘rule or government by the people’. It follows that the government is elected by the majority with the broad principle of ‘one citizen-one vote-one value’. However, it is pertinent to note that this principle has been diluted, in the interest of population control, since 1976 when the delimitation exercise was postponed for the first time.

In a federation like the U.S., the number of seats in the House of Representatives has been capped at 435 since 1913, though the population of the country has increased almost four times from 9.4 crore in 1911 to an estimated 34 crore in 2024.

The main job of a Member of Parliament (MP) is to legislate on ‘Union List’ matters and hold the Union government accountable. Majority of the schemes of the Union Government are implemented by State governments. The country has functioned with 543 Lok Sabha MPs for the past five decades while the population increased from 55 crore to 145 crore. India’s population is projected to peak at around 165-170 crore, an increase of around 15% from the current level, in the next three decades and then decline. Considering the above factors, the 543 MPs in Lok Sabha may be capped at the existing number. It would ensure status quo in representation from various States and uphold the federal principle. The MPs and leaders of both regional and national political parties from the south, smaller States in north and the northeastern States should consider it their responsibility to demand such a cap from the Parliament in order to protect the political interest of the regions they represent. The number of MLAs in each State may be increased in line with the projected population to address the democratic representational requirement.

> **Delimitation** refers to redrawing the boundaries of electoral constituencies based on population changes. Key issues include **political imbalance**, as states with successful population control may lose representation, while high-growth states gain seats. This raises concerns of **regional disparities** and unequal political power. Delimitation may also impact **federal structure**, favoring certain regions over others. Additionally, it can cause **social tensions** by altering caste and community dynamics within constituencies. There's debate over whether it promotes fairness or deepens divisions. With the next possible exercise after **2026**, balancing **representation, regional equity, and national unity** remains a major challenge.

# Designing India’s AI Safety Institute

India’s **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** ambitions took a significant leap forward when Union Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw announced that the country would launch an indigenous AI model and establish an AI Safety Institute (AISI) under the Safe and Trusted Pillar of the **IndiaAI Mission**.

Rather than relying on rigid regulations that may quickly become outdated, governments worldwide are establishing AISIs to address potential AI risks. Since 2023, the U.K., the U.S., Singapore, and Japan, among others, are setting up AISIs. These are not just government-backed research/testing institutes, but a part of the global AISI network that seeks to facilitate **“common technical understanding of AI risks”**. Recently, the U.K.’s AISI unveiled its open source platform called **‘Inspect’** to evaluate models in a range of areas such as their core knowledge, ability to reason, and autonomous capabilities. The U.S.’s AISI convened an inter-departmental taskforce to tackle national security and public safety risks posed by AI. Singapore’s AISI is focusing on content assurance, safe model design, and rigorous testing. Each of these initiatives underscores the need for technical rigour and international collaboration.

### India-specific solutions

India must prioritise imminent local concerns. A critical issue is AI systems’ inaccuracy and their potential to perpetuate discrimination in an Indian setting. The **Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY)** announced that the AISI is set to operate on a hub-and-spoke model, collaborating with academic institutions, startups, industry players, and government departments. This will ensure that India’s unique socioeconomic landscape, linguistic diversity, and technological gaps are addressed.

India’s vibrant startup ecosystem offers valuable lessons. Startups such as Karya are tackling the problem of unrepresentative data by empowering rural communities to create high-quality datasets in Indian languages. Others are advancing multilingual AI development, ensuring inclusivity and accessibility. These efforts highlight how India-specific solutions can address technical challenges while fostering social equity. India’s AISI should build on such initiatives.

The Indian AISI is already seeking to advance indigenous research and development, leveraging Indian datasets. Under the Safe and Trusted pillar, the IndiaAI Mission has already selected eight Responsible AI Projects and launched a second round of Expression of Interest. This focuses on critical areas such as watermarking and labelling, ethical AI frameworks, risk assessment and management, and deep-fake detection tools.

Simultaneously, our AISI should collaborate with global AISIs to understand and mitigate global risks. It should take a leaf from the Bletchley Declaration, signed at the U.K. AI Safety Summit, which focuses on global threats such as cybersecurity threats and disinformation.

### Common global understanding

India’s AISI cannot operate in isolation. To effectively govern AI, it must strike a balance between local relevance and global alignment. This requires adopting international standards while adapting them to India’s context. Interoperability is key, as it enables seamless collaboration and accountability across borders.

A crucial **first** step is to establish a global standardised AI safety taxonomy. Today, technical experts, policymakers, social scientists, and legal professionals may use varying terminologies for discussing AI-related concerns. This divergence and the inherent complexity of AI systems creates communication barriers that hinder safety assessments. A standardised taxonomy would enable meaningful multidisciplinary research by ensuring all stakeholders speak the same language when evaluating AI systems and also clearly attribute responsibilities across the AI supply chain.

**Second**, India’s AISI must also support the creation of an international notification framework for AI model development. This framework would encourage AISIs worldwide to share information about the purpose and potential impact of powerful AI models. Such transparency would enable coordinated governance and help India prepare digital infrastructure for the safe deployment of advanced AI systems.

India’s leadership within the Global South places it in a unique position to champion inclusive AI governance. Many emerging economies lack the resources and technical expertise to establish their own AISIs. India can lead a collective effort in the Global South to co-develop AI safety frameworks and evaluation metrics to tackle local challenges.

The MeitY-UNESCO collaboration on India’s AI readiness provides a strong foundation by identifying gaps in ethical development and deployment of AI. Leveraging these insights, India’s AISI can develop comprehensive frameworks and guidelines that promote both safe AI development and deployment. Additionally, through the ongoing projects under IT Ministry’s IndiaAI Mission, India is focusing on themes such as machine unlearning, synthetic data generation, AI bias mitigation, and privacy-enhancing tools. These can serve as the building blocks of a robust AI safety ecosystem.

India’s AISI should develop indigenous tools and frameworks that embed responsible AI principles by design. At the same time, it must actively engage with the global AISI network to ensure interoperability and collaboration.
