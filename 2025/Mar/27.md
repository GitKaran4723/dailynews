## ⚡ India’s Electric Vehicle Journey: From Vision to Reality

India’s journey towards electric mobility is not just about adopting new technology — it is about **reshaping the future of transportation**, **reducing oil dependence**, and **meeting climate goals**. With rising pollution levels, increasing fuel imports, and the global push for sustainability, electric vehicles (EVs) have emerged as a **strategic priority** for India.

### 🚗 Early Stages: A Slow Start

India’s EV journey began in the early 2000s with small-scale attempts at electric two-wheelers and cars like the **REVA (later Mahindra e2o)**. However, **high battery costs**, **poor infrastructure**, **limited consumer awareness**, and a **lack of policy push** meant that EVs remained on the margins for over a decade.

### 🔁 Policy Shift and Renewed Push

The real momentum began in the **mid-2010s**, when the government launched key initiatives such as:
- **FAME-I (2015)** and **FAME-II (2019)**: Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles.
- **National Electric Mobility Mission Plan (NEMMP)** to promote EV R&D and manufacturing.
- **PLI Scheme (2021)** for Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) battery storage.
- State-level EV policies to support charging infrastructure, subsidies, and manufacturing.

These steps signalled a **policy-level commitment** to electrification, both for private and public transport.

### 🏙️ Urban Momentum: 2W, 3W, and E-Buses

India has seen significant traction in **electric two-wheelers and three-wheelers**, driven by:
- Rising fuel prices.
- Lower operating costs.
- Government incentives.
- Growth of domestic manufacturers (e.g., Ola Electric, Ather Energy, Hero Electric).

In urban transport, **electric buses (e-buses)** have been deployed across cities under the **Smart Cities Mission** and **Green Urban Mobility schemes**, improving clean mass transit options.

### 🔌 Infrastructure and Battery Challenges

Despite progress, India still faces **key challenges**:
- **Inadequate charging infrastructure**, especially outside metros.
- **Range anxiety** and lack of battery swapping options.
- High **upfront costs** despite subsidies.
- Dependence on **imported lithium** and battery components.

Addressing these requires **public-private collaboration**, localization of battery supply chains, and adoption of **battery recycling and reuse ecosystems**.

EV adoption aligns closely with India’s **climate commitments under the Paris Agreement** and its **net-zero by 2070 target**. Reducing dependence on fossil fuels also strengthens **energy security**, given India's heavy oil import bill.

By 2030, the government aims for:
- **70% of commercial cars**,  
- **30% of private cars**,  
- **40% of buses**, and  
- **80% of two and three-wheelers**  
to be electric.

Achieving this will require sustained investment, skilling, consumer awareness, and innovation in grid management.

### 🌱 Conclusion: Accelerating Toward the Future

India’s EV journey is **no longer a question of “if” — but “how fast”**. With a growing domestic market, active startups, global partnerships, and strong policy frameworks, India is positioned to become a **leader in clean mobility**.

However, this journey must be **inclusive**, balancing urban-rural needs, affordability, and sustainability. With the right ecosystem, EVs can drive not just green mobility, but also **green growth**, employment, and energy independence for India’s future.

SUMMARY-> India’s electric vehicle (EV) journey reflects its commitment to sustainable mobility, energy security, and climate goals. Beginning slowly in the 2000s, the EV sector gained momentum with policies like FAME-I, FAME-II, and the PLI scheme. Two-wheelers, three-wheelers, and e-buses have seen rapid adoption, especially in urban areas. However, challenges remain in charging infrastructure, battery supply chains, and affordability. The government aims for significant EV penetration by 2030, aligning with net-zero targets. To succeed, India must ensure local manufacturing, public-private collaboration, and rural inclusion. EVs hold the promise of not just cleaner transport, but greener economic growth for India’s future.

# The role of communities in conserving water
On March 22, World Water Day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi highlighted the need to conserve water for present and future generations through collective action. On the same day, the Ministry of Jal Shakti launched the Jal Shakti Abhiyan: Catch the Rain 2025, emphasising the importance of community participation in water conservation.

### Issues for consideration

In the context of this occasion, it is important to take a panoramic view of India’s water policies, with a focus on rural areas. New environmental challenges and renewed understandings of ecosystems underscore the need to recalibrate rural water policies. The following issues must be considered by policymakers.

*First*, policies should ensure effective participation from communities and mainstream their ecological practices. Indigenous and local communities carry rich knowledge of their immediate ecosystems. Existing policies provide for their participation, but it is limited to the management of water sources; decision-making powers remain with state authorities. Further, policies have overlooked the need to identify and empower communities’ own ecological practices on water management. Rather, they have formalised water governance by introducing uniform practices. This is counter-intuitive to the objective of encouraging effective participation from communities.

Take, for example, Water User Associations (WUAs), which are statutory bodies set up in different States since the 1990s to further participatory irrigation management. Water users (or farmers) are members of these bodies. While the responsibility to manage irrigation sources has been transferred to them, they have little say in decision-making.

*Second*, water policies should consider the disproportionate vulnerability of certain groups to environmental crises. Subaltern social groups and economically marginalised individuals are more vulnerable to such crises than others. Within these groups, those located at the intersection of social and economic marginalisation are the most vulnerable. Therefore, it is crucial for policies to consider the interests of vulnerable groups. Concomitantly, policies must recognise their agency in managing water and ensure their participation in decision-making.

*Third*, policies must address the issue of fragmentation of water management. Here, fragmented management means that different parts of the ecosystem, such as forests, water, land, and biodiversity, are regulated by different policies and authorities. Such an approach fails to consider the interdependence of these constituents. While there have been some efforts towards taking an integrated approach, they are limited and ineffective. Since policies adopt a fragmented approach, they do not always achieve the desired goals, and in fact, adversely affect each other’s potential to do so.

A good example of an integrated approach comes from the ecological practices of rural communities in western India. For example, the practice of establishing orans. Orans are sacred forests which hold deep religious and cultural significance to local communities. Some communities have been establishing orans to serve an additional purpose — water conservation. By augmenting tree and grass cover, orans trap surface runoff and support in-situ rainwater harvesting. Such an appreciation about the interdependence of water with other constituents of the ecosystem is key to effective water management and conservation.

*Fourth*, globally, there has been a thrust on adopting a more-than-human perspective in environmental governance. This means considering the interests of the non-human environment in laws and policies that regulate the environment. This approach is based on the idea that the non-human environment has an intrinsic value, and so its interests must be considered in environmental policies. The judiciary has often subscribed to this approach and developed compelling jurisprudence recognising the rights of nature. However, water policies have overlooked this aspect. Their sole focus has been on human needs for water. Contrastingly, water management practices of some of the local communities in western India take a more holistic perspective to water governance. For example, the amount of water available for irrigation is partly dependent on its sufficient availability for animals.

A *final* issue is the impact of climate change on water. A recent report published in the journal Nature concluded that as global temperatures rise, the water gap in India will widen. Both climate and water policies must address the impact of climate change on water. Water policies must focus on creating climate-resilient water systems and increasing the climate resilience of existing systems; climate policies, particularly adaptation policies, should focus on building the resilience of ecosystems to water gaps.

### Beyond the rhetoric

A common theme across these suggestions is that local and indigenous communities and their practices can support effective water management. Therefore, rural water policies should facilitate active engagement with communities. This means moving beyond the existing rhetoric of engagement, and centering communities’ voices in the decision-making process. While doing so, we must be mindful that communities’ practices may come with their own limitations which should be addressed through sensitisation and capacity building where required.

SUMMARY
> Communities play a vital role in conserving water through collective action, traditional knowledge, and localized solutions. In many regions, community-led initiatives like rainwater harvesting, restoration of ponds, and watershed management have revived water sources and improved groundwater levels. Villagers, women’s self-help groups, and local leaders often act as custodians of water, promoting responsible usage and maintenance of resources. By fostering awareness, accountability, and participation, community involvement ensures sustainable water practices tailored to local needs. Empowering communities not only decentralizes water management but also strengthens resilience against droughts and climate change, making conservation a shared and continuous responsibility.

1. **Administrative Delays:** Bureaucratic hurdles and lack of efficient planning impede timely project implementation.
2. **Lack of Capacity:** Local governing bodies may lack the expertise to design and execute effective projects.
3. **Monitoring Issues:** Inadequate oversight mechanisms lead to inefficient use of resources and delays.

**Government Measures:**

To address these challenges, the central government has introduced stricter guidelines:

- States failing to comply with DMF regulations risk losing fund disbursals.
- The Ministry of Mines is empowered to investigate mismanagement and enforce corrective actions. 

**Recommendations for Effective Utilization:**

1. **Capacity Building:** Enhance the skills of local authorities to plan and execute projects effectively.
2. **Transparent Monitoring:** Implement robust systems to track fund allocation and project progress.
3. **Community Involvement:** Engage local communities in decision-making to ensure projects address genuine needs.

Efficient utilization of DMF funds is crucial for improving the livelihoods of communities in mining-affected areas. Addressing the existing bottlenecks can ensure that the substantial resources collected translate into tangible benefits for those most impacted by mining operations.

SUMMARY 
> The District Mineral Foundation (DMF) was established to support communities affected by mining, yet over half of the ₹1-lakh crore collected remains unspent. As of January 2023, ₹74,830 crore was collected, but only ₹39,222 crore utilized, revealing serious gaps in fund deployment. States like Jharkhand and Odisha lag in effective spending. Key challenges include administrative delays, lack of local capacity, and weak monitoring. The Centre has tightened compliance norms to address inefficiencies. Experts recommend capacity building, transparent fund tracking, and community involvement to ensure DMF funds bring real improvements to mining-impacted regions, promoting inclusive and sustainable development.
