# The gender budget - bigger allocations, little impact

### **The Gender Budget – Bigger Allocations, Little Impact**

#### **Introduction**
The **Gender Budget** in India is a critical financial tool aimed at **promoting gender equality and empowering women** through targeted policies and increased public spending. Despite **higher allocations**, the **impact on women’s economic participation, safety, and social well-being remains limited**. Structural barriers, inefficient implementation, and lack of accountability weaken the effectiveness of gender-responsive budgeting.

---

### **Understanding Gender Budgeting in India**
- Gender Budgeting was introduced in **2005-06** as a part of **fiscal planning** to address **gender disparities**.
- The **Union Budget categorizes expenditures into two parts**:
  1. **Part A**: 100% allocation benefits **women and girls**.
  2. **Part B**: 30-99% of the allocation benefits **women directly or indirectly**.
- The **2023-24 Gender Budget allocation** was **₹2.23 lakh crore**, approximately **4.9% of the total budget**.

---

### **Key Issues: Why Bigger Allocations Yield Limited Impact**
#### **1. Lack of Effective Implementation**
- **Poor fund utilization** leads to underperformance of gender-specific schemes.
- States and local governments **fail to fully integrate gender budgeting** into development planning.

#### **2. Insufficient Monitoring and Accountability**
- No **dedicated institutional framework** to monitor how funds are spent.
- Many schemes lack **impact assessment mechanisms**, making it difficult to measure progress.

#### **3. Gaps in Women-Centric Policies**
- **Health and education** allocations often fail to **reach the most vulnerable women**.
- Schemes like **Beti Bachao Beti Padhao** focus on awareness but **lack substantial financial assistance**.

#### **4. Gender Bias in Employment and Wages**
- **Workforce participation of women** in India remains **low at 24% (PLFS 2022-23)** despite gender budgeting efforts.
- No **strong push for equal pay, skill training, and job opportunities** for women in high-growth sectors.

#### **5. Inadequate Focus on Safety and Social Security**
- Rising **violence against women** requires **stronger implementation of legal and financial support measures**.
- **Shelters, fast-track courts, and legal aid programs** suffer from **insufficient funding and poor execution**.

---

### **Solutions: Making Gender Budgeting More Effective**
1. **Enhancing Implementation and Fund Utilization**
   - States must **mandate gender-based audits** to track spending and outcomes.
   - Introduce **real-time monitoring systems** for efficient fund disbursal.

2. **Strengthening Women’s Economic Participation**
   - Increase **skill development programs** in **STEM, finance, and entrepreneurship**.
   - Ensure **gender-sensitive labor laws** for equal pay and workplace safety.

3. **Expanding Social Security and Safety Measures**
   - Higher investments in **women’s health, sanitation, and digital literacy**.
   - More **fast-track courts and police sensitization programs** for gender-based violence cases.

4. **Grassroots Involvement and Decentralized Planning**
   - Empower **Panchayats and local women’s groups** to monitor gender schemes.
   - Increase direct cash transfers to women for **economic independence**.

---

### **Conclusion**
While **gender budgeting has increased allocations**, its **impact remains limited due to poor implementation, monitoring gaps, and policy inefficiencies**. To **maximize benefits**, India must **ensure accountability, improve fund utilization, and strengthen economic opportunities for women**. A **well-executed gender budget** can drive **real social change and economic empowerment**, making India’s growth truly inclusive.

> India's **Gender Budget**, introduced in **2005-06**, aims to **promote gender equality** through targeted financial allocations. Despite **increased funding (₹2.23 lakh crore in 2023-24)**, its impact remains **limited** due to **poor implementation, weak monitoring, and policy inefficiencies**. **Low workforce participation (24%)**, inadequate **safety measures**, and **ineffective fund utilization** hinder progress. Solutions include **better tracking of funds, gender-sensitive employment policies, improved legal support for women’s safety, and decentralized planning**. To ensure real impact, **India must enhance accountability, skill development, and direct financial support for women**, making gender budgeting a powerful tool for **social and economic transformation**.

# ISRO undocks SpaDex satellites in first attempt

The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has achieved a significant milestone by successfully undocking its Space Docking Experiment (SpaDeX) satellites, SDX01 (Chaser) and SDX02 (Target), in their first attempt. This accomplishment underscores India's growing capabilities in autonomous space operations and positions it alongside nations like the USA, Russia, and China, which have previously demonstrated such expertise.

**Background on SpaDeX Mission**

Launched on December 30, 2024, aboard the PSLV-C60 rocket, the SpaDeX mission aimed to demonstrate autonomous rendezvous and docking technologies, crucial for future endeavors such as satellite servicing, space station operations, and interplanetary missions. The mission involved two identical satellites, SDX01 and SDX02, each weighing approximately 220 kg. Post-launch, the satellites were deployed separately to create an initial separation of about 20 km, after which they executed maneuvers to commence the rendezvous operation.

**Docking Achievements**

After a series of precise maneuvers, the Chaser (SDX01) successfully docked with the Target (SDX02) on January 16, 2025, making India the fourth nation to achieve this feat. This docking validated ISRO's indigenous technologies, including the Bhartiya Docking System (BDS), which is based on the International Docking System Standard (IDSS). The successful docking was a critical step toward India's ambitions in human spaceflight and the establishment of a space station.

**Undocking Milestone**

Following the successful docking, ISRO meticulously planned the undocking procedure to further validate the reliability and precision of its autonomous docking technologies. The undocking was executed flawlessly, with both satellites separating as intended and continuing their operations independently. This successful undocking demonstrates ISRO's capability to manage complex space operations, a vital competency for future missions involving modular spacecraft and on-orbit assembly.

**Future Implications**

The success of the SpaDeX mission, encompassing both docking and undocking operations, has significant implications for India's space program:

- **Human Spaceflight Missions**: The technologies validated through SpaDeX are essential for the upcoming Gaganyaan mission, India's first crewed spaceflight program, ensuring safe docking and undocking procedures for crew modules.

- **Space Station Development**: Mastering docking and undocking maneuvers is a prerequisite for assembling and operating a space station, aligning with India's plans to establish its own orbital station in the coming decade.

- **Satellite Servicing and Debris Management**: The ability to dock and undock satellites paves the way for in-orbit satellite servicing, refueling, and active debris removal, contributing to sustainable space operations.

In conclusion, ISRO's successful undocking of the SpaDeX satellites marks a pivotal advancement in India's space capabilities, reinforcing its position as a key player in global space exploration and technology development.
