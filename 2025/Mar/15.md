# A voluntary mandate

**Analysis of APAAR ID Implementation in India**  

### **1. Introduction to APAAR ID**  
- The **Automated Permanent Academic Account Registry (APAAR) ID** is introduced by the **Ministry of Education** to **digitize academic transcripts** of students.  
- It aims to ensure a **"single source of truth"** for student records throughout their academic life.  
- Linked to **Aadhaar**, APAAR is part of India's **digital transformation in education** under the **National Education Policy (NEP) 2020**.  

---

### **2. Existing Digital Education Initiatives**  
- APAAR is **not the first step** in digitizing school records. Other initiatives include:  
  - **Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+)**  
  - **Student Database Management Information System**  
- These **aim to streamline education data** but raise concerns about privacy and data security.  

---

### **3. APAAR: A Voluntary System Being Enforced as Mandatory**  
- The **Education Ministry has stated that APAAR is not mandatory**.  
- However, in **Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka**, schools have been given a target of **100% student enrolment**.  
- Schools and administrators have **pressured parents and religious minority institutions** to enroll, despite the lack of legal backing.  
- **Mismatch in enrolment data** between APAAR and existing records has been **used as a coercive tool**.  

---

### **4. Coercive Implementation and De Facto Mandate**  
- The **government has used similar strategies** in the past to push for **Aadhaar-based services** (e.g., **Digi Yatra**).  
- By ensuring **widespread adoption before legal mandates**, the system becomes **de facto mandatory**.  
- **Errors such as name mismatches** have led to **failure of enrolment**, affecting students unfairly.  

---

### **5. Privacy and Legal Concerns**  
- The **Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023** is yet to be implemented, raising concerns about **data misuse and security**.  
- The **Supreme Court’s right to privacy judgment** has ruled that **Aadhaar cannot be mandated for basic education**.  
- APAAR **functions as a proxy** to sidestep this ruling, raising **constitutional and ethical concerns**.  

---

### **6. Need for Legislative Backing**  
- If the government aims to **improve record-keeping in education**, it should **introduce proper legislation** rather than enforce systems through indirect coercion.  
- Ensuring **informed consent and voluntary participation** must be a priority in **Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI)** initiatives.  
- Without legal safeguards, **data collection under APAAR poses significant risks** to privacy and autonomy.  

---

### **7. Conclusion**  
- While **digitizing academic records is a progressive step**, the **implementation of APAAR raises concerns about coercion, privacy, and legal validity**.  
- **Forced enrolment without informed consent contradicts** the government’s own declaration that APAAR is voluntary.  
- The **government must prioritize transparency, legal backing, and data protection** before pushing such large-scale digital initiatives.

> The **APAAR ID**, introduced by the **Ministry of Education**, aims to **digitize academic records** and provide a **unified student database**. While officially voluntary, its **enforcement in states like Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka** shows coercive implementation, pressuring parents and institutions to achieve **100% enrolment**. This mirrors past government tactics with **Aadhaar**, creating **de facto mandates**. Concerns include **data privacy, name mismatches, and lack of legal backing**, especially with the **Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023** still pending. The **Supreme Court has ruled Aadhaar cannot be mandated for education**, making APAAR a **proxy to bypass privacy rights**. Proper legislation is needed.

# A school closure that must be called out

The order to close down the only Gondi-medium school in a village of Maharashtra raises important questions. The school was started in Mohgaon village in the Fifth Schedule area of the Gadchiroli district, in 2019, as a result of a resolution by the gram panchayat, for tribal students to achieve better learning outcomes by imparting primary education in their mother tongue. This initiative was in consonance with Article 29 of the Constitution, which provides minorities the right to preserve distinct languages, scripts and cultures, and Article 350(a) which mandates that the state should make adequate provisions so that children of minority groups may receive instruction in their mother tongue.

However, the local administration has argued that as the school is not registered under the Right to Education Act, 2009, its standards cannot be monitored. Non-recognition would also jeopardise the future of students when they transition to higher classes. However, an education officer has said that in case of closure, the students will be ‘absorbed’ in other schools.

### Subordination by bias

While the objection of the administration is couched in bureaucratic language, it must be emphasised that the question of recognition is fundamentally a question of power, and only derivatively that of procedure. Non-recognition of the school is linked to the structural and socio-political subordination of the Adivasi communities owing to the normative bias of the state against their language and culture. Therefore, spotlighting the moral and political context of this ‘bureaucratic’ refusal by the local administration becomes important.

Jawaharlal Nehru was of the firm view that the Adivasi communities must grow according to their own genius. His view was informed by the historical experience of the past two centuries which saw many tribal communities being driven to the verge of extinction as a result of the vicious violence unleashed by the colonial state across the world.

Therefore, the Constitution has provisions to preserve and protect the tribal way of life — rights over land, language, culture and customs. These provisions are intended to enable tribal communities to participate in the process of nation-building while guarding against the loss of their identity.

### Forces of absorption

However, the forces of absorption, which operate in the secular and religious realms, have had an immensely deleterious impact on the tribal communities since Independence. In the secular realm, absorption is carried out by the state and the market, while in the religious realm, absorption is carried out through the denigration, distortion and erasure of tribal religious beliefs. Both these forces of absorption complement each other.

This particular case, of the school’s possible closure, is one of absorption through the state which is operationalised through the non-recognition of the elements of tribal culture. This is reflected most clearly in the current status of Adivasi languages in the Constitution. Out of the 22 languages included in the Eighth Schedule, major tribal languages such as Gondi and Bhili are absent.

Gondi, which according to the 2011 Census, is spoken by more than 29 lakh people primarily across six States, is not included within the Eighth Schedule. Therefore, the state has no obligation to promote it at the national level.

On the contrary, Sanskrit, which is considered the Devbhasha or the language of the gods, is spoken by less than 25,000 people across the country, is listed in the Eighth Schedule. The contrast between Sanskrit and Gondi is necessary in this context because both are minority languages. Both are unlikely to be amplified by the market nor can they be considered necessary in getting employment. However, both these minority languages have contrasting fates due to the socio-political power wielded by the community which seeks to promote them — one is recognised by the state while the other is neglected.

### Specificity of Adivasi languages

The need to confer state recognition becomes all the more important in the case of Adivasi communities because their culture has an oral tradition which includes their originary myths, religious beliefs and tales of the past. In the present context, given the rapid erosion of the Adivasi identity due to the clearing of forests, increasing urbanisation and rampant marketisation of society, the primary site of the construction of the Adivasi identity (historical memory which is transmitted orally) may face danger. The extinction of an Adivasi language might cause irreparable loss to that identity. Therefore, Adivasi languages must be accorded special status to ensure their protection.

It is ironic that those who claim to follow the Constitution, which derives its legitimacy from ‘we, the people’, recognise and promote the Devbhasha but neglect the Janbhasha (language of the people) of the Adivasi people. This gross moral failure must be addressed. It can be remedied, with the first step being the recognition of the Gondi-speaking school in focus and then expanding such schools. This would be in line with the spirit of the Constitution as well.

> In Maharashtra, the proposed closure of **schools teaching Gondi language** has raised serious concerns. Gondi, spoken primarily by tribal communities, holds immense cultural and linguistic significance. The closure of schools offering Gondi education threatens to **marginalize** these communities and **undermine efforts to preserve their language and culture**. Despite the state's educational reforms, such closures risk **increasing educational inequality**, especially for students in tribal regions. Activists and educators argue that the government must prioritize **inclusive education** that supports **tribal languages**, ensuring that Gondi-speaking students receive **education in their native language** while preserving their heritage.

# Aditya-L1 mission: scientists observe a flareless coronal mass ejection

The **Aditya-L1** mission, launched by the **Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)** on **September 2, 2023**, is India's inaugural solar observatory mission. Positioned at the **Lagrange point 1 (L1)**, approximately 1.5 million kilometers from Earth, Aditya-L1 provides continuous, unobstructed observations of the Sun. Its primary objectives include studying the solar corona, investigating chromospheric and coronal heating, understanding the physics of partially ionized plasma, and analyzing the origins of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and solar magnetic storms. The mission also aims to monitor space weather and examine the dynamics of solar wind particles. citeturn0search0

**Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs)** are significant expulsions of plasma and magnetic fields from the Sun's corona, capable of ejecting billions of tons of coronal material. These ejections can travel outward from the Sun at speeds ranging from below 250 kilometers per second to nearly 3,000 kilometers per second. CMEs can interact with Earth's magnetosphere, potentially causing geomagnetic storms that may disrupt power grids, satellite communications, and navigation systems. citeturn0search2

Recently, scientists utilizing data from the Aditya-L1 mission observed a **flareless coronal mass ejection**, a type of CME that occurs without an accompanying solar flare. Such observations are crucial for understanding the mechanisms behind CMEs and improving space weather forecasting. Aditya-L1's continuous monitoring capabilities at the L1 point enable the detection and analysis of these and other solar phenomena, contributing significantly to our knowledge of solar dynamics and their impact on Earth's space environment.

> The **Aditya-L1 mission**, launched by **ISRO on September 2, 2023**, is India's first **solar observatory** positioned at **Lagrange Point 1 (L1)**. It continuously monitors the **solar corona, solar winds, and coronal mass ejections (CMEs)** to improve space weather predictions. **CMEs** are large plasma and magnetic field expulsions from the Sun, which can disrupt **Earth’s communication systems and power grids**. Recently, Aditya-L1 detected a **flareless CME**, occurring without a solar flare, enhancing our understanding of solar activity. This mission significantly contributes to studying **solar dynamics, space weather forecasting, and protecting Earth’s technological infrastructure** from solar disturbances.
