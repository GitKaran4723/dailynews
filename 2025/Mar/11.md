# Flawed food regulations fuel the obesity crisis

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call to tackle obesity and the 2025 Economic Survey’s recommendation of imposing a ‘health tax’ on ultra-processed foods (UPFs) to curb their consumption are both laudable. But these efforts risk being derailed by India’s ambiguous, industry-friendly, and subjective food marketing regulations. In India, one in four adult men and women are obese and one in four adults are either diabetic or pre-diabetic (National Family Health Survey-5). This underlines the urgency of the problem.

Right to Information responses and official communications expose how various Ministries and the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) have not been able to implement the labelling or advertising regulations planned in 2017 and continue to rely on regulations that are ambiguous and subjective in nature. No wonder there are so many advertisements of UPFs, and no front-of-pack labels yet.

### Labelling and advertising

In September 2022, the FSSAI proposed the Indian Nutrition Rating, a ‘health star’ labelling system modelled on Australia’s not-so-successful framework, which was developed by a food industry technologist. In this system, half a star means that the food is ‘least healthy’ and 5 stars means that it qualifies as ‘healthiest’. Right to Information responses confirm that the FSSAI relied on an IIM Ahmedabad study to justify the rating system — a study it never critically evaluated. Worse, food industry representatives dominated key stakeholder meetings and members of the scientific panel were sidelined. The whole process sided with industry, as a member of the stakeholder group pointed out. Moreover, the FSSAI ignored its own 2021 draft regulations indicating ‘traffic light’ colour-coded and mandatory warning labels and instead bowed down to industry lobbying.

The Indian Nutrition Rating system is flawed because the stars, at best, can mislead consumers by creating a health halo on all pre-packaged unhealthy food products. The system allows foods high in fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) and UPFs, such as biscuits, flaunt two stars on the packet when they might otherwise have four warning signals. Similarly, a soft drink that should have a high warning in sugar instead gets two stars. Corn flakes, which is is high in sugar and sodium, gets 3 stars. This means that the system allows all these foods to be some level of healthy.

Globally, warning labels that say the product is high in sugar/salt or bad fats allow consumers to know the true nature of the product and make a choice. Most of the front-of-pack labels in use today are warning labels. For instance, Chile’s black ‘high in’ labels reduced consumption of UPFs by 24%. The fix is therefore to ensure that front-of-pack labels are notified soon and replace stars with mandatory ‘high in’ warnings on HFSS foods and UPFs, based on the World Health Organization’s guidelines or the National Institute of Nutrition’s Dietary Guideline for Indians.

India has four laws to curb misleading advertising for HFSS/ UPFs but none of them is effective, according to reports and data. The National Multisectoral Action Plan, 2017, called for an amendment to these laws to include restrictions on advertisements on HFSS foods, but no regulatory action has been taken so far.

Existing regulations are ambiguous and subjective. The Consumer Protection Act, 2019, defines as ‘misleading’ any product or service that deliberately conceals important information. If we interpret important information to be about fat/sugar or salt, FSSAI does not agree. FSS regulations nowhere specify that nutritional information of a food product must be provided in the advertisement. This means that a cola drink can target people, especially children and youth, without disclosing that the drink contains 9-10 teaspoons of sugar per bottle. FSS regulations are yet to provide a definition of HFSS or UPFs and thresholds beyond which these will be regulated.

The result is continued freedom to advertise unhealthy addictive food products across media. This puts people at risk of obesity and diabetes. Studies show that if regulations banning junk foods are implemented, it would cut the rate of childhood obesity significantly.

### The path forward

The Economic Survey rightly demands stringent front-of-pack labels and stricter marketing curbs. To achieve this, India needs to take the following steps. First, it needs to scrap the Indian Nutrition Rating system and adopt warning labels. Second, there must be clear sugar/salt/fat limits for HFSS foods. The World Health Organization’s SEARO guidelines and the Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Nutrition guidelines offer a template. Third, advertising loopholes need to be closed through the amendment of existing laws or the enactment of a new one harmonising all laws under a unified UPF/HFSS advertisement ban. Fourth, the government could consider launching a campaign on the risks of UPFs in all languages.

India’s obesity crisis is not a public failure but a policy failure. The Economic Survey offers a road map to rectify this. Without urgent action, the plan to halt obesity by 2025 will not be successful. The Prime Minister’s vision of a healthy India demands more than rhetoric; India needs a regulatory approach that does not sacrifice children’s health for corporate profit. The suggestions in the Economic Survey can break the cycle to achieve the Prime Minister’s vision. It is for the policy makers to show urgency and will.

> Flawed **food regulations** contribute significantly to the **global obesity crisis** by allowing the widespread availability of **ultra-processed foods high in sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats**. Weak labeling laws, aggressive **junk food marketing**, and **subsidies for unhealthy ingredients** promote poor dietary choices. Many governments fail to impose **strict nutritional standards**, making it difficult for consumers to make informed decisions. Additionally, **misleading health claims** on packaging further deceive consumers. Stronger policies, including **taxes on sugary drinks, stricter advertising regulations, and clearer food labeling**, are needed to combat obesity and promote **public health** by encouraging access to **nutritious and whole foods**.

# A multi-dimensional approach

Challenges in higher education are becoming increasingly nuanced and complex. Technological innovations, shifting human-machine frontiers, and advances in AI, Healthcare, and Medicine are emerging as key focus areas. The World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2023 highlights that 44% of workers’ skills will be disrupted by 2027. Analytical and creative thinking will be crucial skills in the next five years, closely followed by leadership, social influence, resilience, flexibility, and agility.

### Possible approaches

The future of higher education lies in the fine integration of these skill sets. The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) emphasises a principles-based and outcomes-focused approach and underscores the need for experiential learning, social impact, career readiness, and partnerships. Similarly, the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology emphasises skill competency while ensuring that academic programmes meet high-quality standards aligned with industry needs. The National Board of Accreditation in India focuses on achieving desirable outcomes in knowledge, skills, attitudes, and behaviour, based on an ‘Input-Process-Output’ model. Additionally, the National Educational Policy (NEP) 2020 emphasises knowledge, skills, values, and dispositions that support responsible commitment to human rights, sustainable development, and global well-being.

The question now is whether Indian higher education institutions (HEIs) are equipping students with these skills, or still fixated on teaching them to remember and understand subjects through a taxonomical design, such as Bloom’s Taxonomy? The answer, unfortunately, is a resounding “Yes”, with some exceptions.

How can we prepare students to be future ready? Competency-based education (CBE) and outcome-based education (OBE) are two dominant approaches to assess student learning. OBE emphasises mastery of specific skills and competencies that reflect real-world experiences, while CBE aligns educational outcomes with the labour market needs, increases employability, and fosters industry connections. Unfortunately, both often focus on discipline-centric skills and overlook discipline-neutral ones. Consequently, HEIs assess educational relevance by emphasising multidisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity as educational outcomes. While CBE advocates for a transformative approach, there remains a transactional focus.

The skill gaps in higher education are particularly pronounced in the technology sector. A high rate of graduate unemployment due to a mismatch between the skills taught in colleges/universities and those needed by industry has led to poor job performance and employer dissatisfaction, particularly in areas such as writing, editing, research, and data analysis.

### Three-step assessment

These challenges can be addressed by a new framework that effectively integrates knowledge, cognition, and social inquiry into the educational curriculum, focusing on skill development and social orientation. It positions students as key stakeholders alongside parents, industry representatives, and faculty and emphasises social orientation and skills competency by integrating OBE and CBE, promoting a multidimensional approach to learning. It enables students to develop higher-order skills, enhance their capacity for social inquiry, and refine and sharpen their competencies throughout their academic journey.

Not only does it formally integrate social inquiry into educational design but also strengthens skills and competency courses while establishing a robust, communicative, and engaging framework. This allows for mapping students’ skills and social orientation through a well-defined mentoring process, including corporate mentoring in subsequent stages. The framework involves a three-stage assessment:

Stage I: Initial assessment of student skills during the orientation programme and/or at the start of classes. Students participate in the Learners Value Proposition (LVP), which, while not mandatory, facilitates skills mapping. Once the results are analysed, they are aligned with the programme’s mission and objectives, creating a case file for each student.

Stage II: Assigned mentors conduct continuous assessment at the end of each semester and implement the necessary intervention for skill development through electives and participation in activities or field projects. Corporate mentorship and parental feedback can be integrated aiding in competency mapping and social orientation for internships.

Stage III: The final assessment compiles a comprehensive student profile, which maps skills competency in alignment with future job requirements and upskilling needs.

Higher education must prepare students to be future flag-bearers who will tackle complex global problems. The World Bank’s latest report on poverty reveals that 8.5% of the world’s population still lives on less than $2.15 a day. The critical question remains: are we adequately preparing our future problem-solvers with the relevant skills, knowledge, and competencies?

> A **multi-dimensional approach in higher education** in India focuses on **holistic learning** by integrating **academic knowledge, skill development, research, innovation, and ethical values**. The **National Education Policy (NEP) 2020** emphasizes **interdisciplinary learning, technology integration, vocational training, and global competitiveness**. Higher education institutions are encouraged to adopt **experiential learning, industry collaborations, and digital education** to prepare students for **real-world challenges**. Personalized learning, critical thinking, and **inclusivity** are key aspects. By promoting **flexibility, research-driven education, and innovation**, a multi-dimensional approach ensures that graduates are **skilled, employable, and socially responsible**, fostering a **knowledge-driven and globally competitive India**.

# Existentialism

# **Existentialism: A Philosophical Exploration**

## **Introduction**  
Existentialism is a **philosophical movement** that explores themes of **individual freedom, choice, responsibility, and the search for meaning in an indifferent universe**. It emerged primarily in the **19th and 20th centuries**, influenced by philosophers like **Søren Kierkegaard, Friedrich Nietzsche, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Albert Camus**. Existentialism challenges traditional beliefs about morality, religion, and human purpose, emphasizing that individuals must create their own meaning in life.

---

## **Core Themes of Existentialism**  

### **1. Individual Freedom and Responsibility**  
- Existentialists believe that humans are **radically free** to shape their own destinies.  
- This freedom comes with **responsibility**, meaning individuals cannot blame fate, society, or God for their actions.  
- **Jean-Paul Sartre’s** famous phrase, *“Man is condemned to be free”*, highlights the burden of personal choice.

### **2. Existence Precedes Essence**  
- Sartre argued that humans are not born with a predetermined purpose (*essence*), unlike objects (e.g., a knife is made for cutting).  
- Instead, people **define themselves through their actions**.  
- This challenges traditional religious and moral frameworks that assume a predefined human nature.

### **3. The Absurdity of Life**  
- Existentialists acknowledge that life **lacks inherent meaning**.  
- **Albert Camus**, in *The Myth of Sisyphus*, describes life as **absurd**, comparing human existence to a man endlessly pushing a rock up a hill.  
- However, Camus suggests that we should **embrace the absurd** and find joy in the struggle itself.

### **4. Authenticity vs. Bad Faith**  
- **Authenticity** means living in accordance with one's true self, rather than conforming to societal expectations.  
- **Bad faith (mauvaise foi)** occurs when people deceive themselves into thinking they have no choice, such as working in a dull job and blaming circumstances rather than making a change.  
- Sartre’s example of a **waiter who acts overly mechanical** highlights this concept—he is not just a waiter but pretends to be nothing more than that.

### **5. Alienation and Anxiety**  
- Existentialists recognize that modern individuals often feel **alienated** from society, religion, and even themselves.  
- **Existential anxiety (angst)** arises when one confronts the weight of personal freedom and the lack of external meaning.  
- Kierkegaard referred to this as the “dizziness of freedom.”

---

## **Major Existentialist Thinkers**  

### **1. Søren Kierkegaard (1813–1855)**
- Considered the **father of existentialism**.  
- Explored **faith, despair, and individuality**.  
- Proposed that true meaning comes from a **personal relationship with God**, but individuals must choose faith in the face of doubt.

### **2. Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900)**
- Declared *“God is dead”*, suggesting that traditional religious values no longer provide meaning.  
- Introduced the concept of the **Übermensch (Superman)**, an individual who creates his own values.  

### **3. Jean-Paul Sartre (1905–1980)**
- Defined existentialism as **a philosophy of human freedom**.  
- Introduced the concepts of **bad faith, authenticity, and radical freedom**.  

### **4. Albert Camus (1913–1960)**
- Focused on **absurdism**, arguing that life’s meaninglessness should not lead to despair but to **rebellion against the absurd**.  

---

## **Criticism of Existentialism**  
- **Too pessimistic**: Critics argue that existentialism is overly focused on despair and anxiety.  
- **Ignores social structures**: Some believe it overemphasizes individual freedom while neglecting external factors like poverty or oppression.  
- **Contradictory**: Some existentialists, like Kierkegaard, believe in God, while others, like Sartre, reject religious meaning.  

---

## **Conclusion**  
Existentialism is a **deeply personal** and **powerful** philosophy that challenges individuals to **take responsibility for their existence**. It does not offer easy answers but encourages people to create their own meaning in an absurd world. Whether through faith (Kierkegaard), self-overcoming (Nietzsche), radical freedom (Sartre), or embracing the absurd (Camus), existentialism remains a **profound exploration of human life and purpose**.

# What is behind the rise of quick commerce?

Quick commerce’s initial utility was presented to under-lockdown customers during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the youngest avenue of digital shopping, having outlived its initial utility, stayed on to alter how people shop — particularly in urban India.

### How does quick commerce function?

As a subclass of e-commerce, quick commerce (Q-commerce) entails rapid delivery, typically in 10 to 20 minutes, of products to the customer’s doorstep. This is facilitated by an elaborate network of dark stores and/or distribution centres. Dark stores refer to warehouses used by the platforms solely to fulfil online orders, with no in-person shopping. The idea is to be in close proximity to the consumer to facilitate faster deliveries.

Additionally, unlike a traditional retail store or modern retail (super or hyper markets), quick commerce based around a mobile app benefits from customer data to create a feedback loop. This helps them provide a customised shopping experience in addition to planning their inventory and responding better to the demand of a product (and categories). An example could be estimating when to stock up a certain product that has a seasonal demand or an abrupt demographic influence, among others.

### What’s in it for brands?

According to a paper by the Centre for Transportation and Logistics of IIM Ahmedabad, quick commerce is beneficial to retailers owing to the prospect of enhanced brand awareness among consumers citing their proliferation. Angshuman Bhattacharya, Partner and National Leader for Consumer Product and Retail Sector at EY-Parthenon, observed that the availability of low-cost employable manpower, of a certain age and economic profile, has been among the crucial factors for the uptick and efficiency of quick commerce in India. The other aspect is about abundant choice. Scale also enables supply side advantages to quick commerce platforms. “If an individual company has to distribute a frozen or chilled product, they could be required to place a freezer in a Kirana store which is very expensive,” he noted.

According to Grant Thorton Bharat, the Indian quick commerce market is presently valued at $3.34 billion and is expected to reach $9.95 billion by 2029. The industry grew 76% YoY in FY 2024.

### What about traditional retailers?

Non-government organisations, representing FMCG stockists and distributors across India, and the All-India Consumer Products Distribution Federation (AICPDF) in their recent complaint to the Competition Commission of India (CCI) accused the quick commerce trio (Blinkit, Zepto and Swiggy Instamart) of anti-competitive practices. Predatory pricing and deep discounting were among the major concerns highlighted by the distributors’ forum. According to them, the platforms “unfairly” set prices of products below landing costs to deliberately eliminate competitors from the market. Once the objective is attained, platforms increase prices to recoup the loss. The AICPDF also pointed to the platforms having “deep pockets” because of the inflow from venture capitalists and/or foreign direct investment. The complainants have also accused that platform of using data (from app activity) to facilitate differential pricing. This could be based on the customers’ location, device type and/or specific purchasing behaviour. The federation highlighted that with traditional retailers unable to compete, “millions of retail shops and distributors” are being wiped out of business or experiencing losses.

### **The Rise of Quick Commerce (Q-Commerce)**  
Quick commerce (Q-commerce) is an **ultra-fast delivery model** that has gained significant traction due to changing consumer preferences, urbanization, and technological advancements. Unlike traditional e-commerce, which delivers goods in **a few days**, Q-commerce ensures deliveries **within 10–30 minutes**.  

#### **Key Drivers Behind the Rise of Quick Commerce**  

1. **Changing Consumer Behavior**  
   - Demand for **instant gratification** and convenience.  
   - Growth in **single-person households** and busy urban lifestyles.  
   - Increased reliance on **digital payments and mobile apps**.  

2. **Advancements in Technology**  
   - AI-driven inventory management and **predictive analytics** optimize delivery.  
   - **Dark stores** (warehouses in urban areas) reduce delivery time.  
   - GPS-based **real-time tracking** enhances efficiency.  

3. **Increased Internet and Smartphone Penetration**  
   - More consumers are shifting to **app-based shopping**.  
   - Social media and personalized marketing boost demand.  

4. **Competitive Market Strategies**  
   - Companies like **Blinkit, Zepto, Dunzo, Swiggy Instamart, and Amazon Fresh** compete with aggressive pricing and fast service.  
   - Strategic partnerships with **local kirana stores** help expand reach.  

5. **COVID-19 Pandemic Impact**  
   - Lockdowns accelerated **online grocery and essentials delivery**.  
   - Consumers became more accustomed to fast home delivery.

### **Can Brick-and-Mortar and Online Shopping Coexist?**  
Yes, brick-and-mortar stores and online shopping can **coexist and complement** each other through **omnichannel retail strategies**.  

#### **Why Both Can Exist Together?**  

1. **Consumer Preferences Vary**  
   - Some customers prefer **in-store experiences** (e.g., trying clothes, fresh produce selection).  
   - Others prefer **online convenience** (e.g., busy professionals, urban dwellers).  

2. **Hybrid Shopping Models**  
   - **Click-and-collect (BOPIS - Buy Online, Pick Up In-Store)**: Customers order online and collect from physical stores.  
   - **Phygital Retail (Physical + Digital)**: Brands integrate digital tools into stores (e.g., self-checkout, virtual try-ons).  

3. **Local Store Advantage**  
   - **Hyperlocal deliveries** enable brick-and-mortar stores to compete with e-commerce.  
   - **Proximity-based sales** reduce delivery costs and enhance customer trust.  

4. **E-Commerce Giants Opening Physical Stores**  
   - Amazon, Reliance, and Flipkart have launched **physical stores** to expand market reach.  
   - **Retailers use physical stores as fulfillment hubs** for faster deliveries.  

---

### **Conclusion**  
The **rise of Q-commerce** is fueled by speed, convenience, and technology, but traditional shopping isn't obsolete. **A hybrid retail ecosystem**, where **physical stores and online platforms integrate seamlessly**, will define the future of shopping. **Omnichannel strategies** allow both models to thrive, catering to different consumer needs while ensuring efficiency in the retail landscape.

> **Quick commerce (Q-commerce)** is rising due to changing consumer habits, technology, and demand for **instant delivery (10–30 minutes)**. Key drivers include **urban lifestyles, AI-driven logistics, dark stores, and mobile commerce**. Companies like **Blinkit, Zepto, and Swiggy Instamart** lead the market.  

Despite this, **brick-and-mortar stores and online shopping can coexist** through **omnichannel strategies** like **click-and-collect, hybrid retail, and hyperlocal deliveries**. Physical stores offer **personalized experiences**, while e-commerce ensures **convenience**. Giants like **Amazon and Reliance** blend both models for efficiency. The future of retail lies in a **seamless online-offline integration**, meeting diverse consumer needs with both speed and in-store experiences.

# WTO 

# **World Trade Organization (WTO): A Comprehensive Overview**

The **World Trade Organization (WTO)** is a global institution that regulates international trade between nations. It was established to create a fair, transparent, and predictable trading system, ensuring that trade flows smoothly and freely among its **164 member countries**. The WTO provides a framework for negotiating trade agreements, resolving disputes, and enforcing trade rules.

This article covers everything about the WTO, including its history, principles, agreements, dispute settlement mechanisms, criticisms, and future challenges.

---

## **1. Historical Background of WTO**

### **1.1 Predecessor: General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)**
Before the WTO, the **General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)** was established in **1947** as a temporary measure to regulate international trade and reduce tariffs. However, GATT had limitations:
- It focused mainly on trade in **goods**, excluding services and intellectual property.
- It lacked an **enforcement mechanism**, making dispute resolution difficult.

### **1.2 Establishment of WTO**
To address GATT’s shortcomings, the **Uruguay Round of negotiations (1986–1994)** led to the formation of the **WTO on January 1, 1995**. The WTO **replaced GATT** and expanded its scope to include **trade in services, intellectual property, and dispute resolution**.

---

## **2. Objectives of WTO**
The WTO aims to:
1. Promote **free and fair trade** by reducing trade barriers.
2. Ensure a **predictable and transparent** trading environment.
3. Provide a **forum for negotiations** on trade agreements.
4. Settle **trade disputes** between member countries.
5. Assist **developing nations** in integrating into the global trading system.
6. Cooperate with other international organizations like the **IMF and World Bank**.

---

## **3. Principles of WTO**
The WTO operates on **six fundamental principles**:

### **3.1 Most-Favored Nation (MFN)**
- Under **Article I of GATT**, any trade benefit given to one WTO member must be extended to all members.
- Example: If India reduces tariffs on U.S. goods, it must extend the same benefit to all WTO members.

### **3.2 National Treatment Principle**
- Imported goods must be treated **equally** to domestic goods once they enter the market.
- Example: India cannot impose extra regulations on foreign smartphones while giving Indian brands an advantage.

### **3.3 Free Trade through Negotiations**
- Members **negotiate** to **lower tariffs and trade barriers**.
- Example: WTO rounds have led to **tariff reductions** worldwide.

### **3.4 Predictability and Transparency**
- Members must **publish trade policies** and notify WTO of any changes.
- Example: If India changes its import duties, it must inform the WTO.

### **3.5 Fair Competition**
- WTO discourages **dumping** (selling goods below cost) and **subsidies** that distort competition.
- Example: The U.S. accused China of dumping steel at low prices, leading to WTO intervention.

### **3.6 Special Treatment for Developing Countries**
- WTO allows **developing nations** more flexibility in implementing trade agreements.
- Example: India gets longer transition periods to implement WTO rules.

---

## **4. WTO Agreements**
The WTO governs trade through various agreements. Some of the most important ones include:

### **4.1 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)**
- Governs **trade in goods**.
- Reduces **tariffs and trade restrictions**.
- Ensures **non-discrimination** in trade.

### **4.3 Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS)**
- Protects **patents, copyrights, and trademarks**.
- Important in the **pharmaceutical and technology sectors**.

### **4.4 Agreement on Agriculture (AoA)**
- Regulates **agricultural subsidies and tariffs**.
- Developing countries like India **oppose** WTO restrictions on food stockpiling.

### **4.5 Agreement on Trade-Related Investment Measures (TRIMS)**
- Prohibits restrictions like **local content requirements** in foreign investments.

### **4.6 Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS)**
- Ensures **food safety and animal/plant health** in trade.

### **4.7 Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT)**
- Prevents **technical regulations from becoming trade barriers**.

---

## **5. WTO Dispute Settlement Mechanism**
One of the most significant roles of the WTO is resolving trade disputes between countries.

### **5.1 Steps in Dispute Resolution**
1. **Consultations** – Countries first try to negotiate a solution.
2. **Panel Formation** – If talks fail, a **WTO panel** investigates.
3. **Panel Report** – The panel issues a ruling.
4. **Appeal Process** – If a country disagrees, it can appeal to the **Appellate Body**.
5. **Implementation** – If found guilty, the country must **change its policies** or face **trade sanctions**.

### **5.2 Examples of WTO Disputes**
- **India-U.S. Solar Panel Case (2016)**: The WTO ruled against India’s **domestic content requirements** in its solar energy sector.
- **U.S.-China Trade War**: The WTO ruled that the U.S.’s tariffs on Chinese goods violated trade rules.

---

## **6. Criticism of WTO**
Despite its benefits, the WTO has faced criticism from various quarters.

### **6.1 Favoritism Towards Developed Countries**
- Developing nations argue that WTO rules **favor rich nations**.
- Example: **TRIPS agreement** benefits pharmaceutical companies in developed countries.

### **6.2 Failure to Address Agricultural Subsidies**
- The U.S. and EU **subsidize their farmers**, making it difficult for developing countries to compete.

### **6.3 Lack of Enforcement Power**
- The **Appellate Body** has been weakened due to U.S. resistance to appointing new judges.

### **6.4 Growing Protectionism**
- Many countries (like the U.S. and China) are adopting **trade restrictions**, undermining WTO principles.

---

## **7. Future Challenges and Reforms**
### **7.1 WTO Reform Discussions**
- Many countries are pushing for **WTO reform** to make it more effective.
- The **G20 and UN** are discussing new trade rules.

### **7.2 Addressing Digital Trade and E-Commerce**
- WTO is working on **new agreements** to regulate **cross-border digital trade**.

### **7.3 Strengthening the Dispute Settlement System**
- Efforts are being made to **revive the Appellate Body**.

### **7.4 Climate Change and Trade**
- The WTO may adopt **green trade rules** to promote **sustainable development**.

---

## **8. Conclusion**
The **WTO is the backbone of global trade**, ensuring **free, fair, and predictable** trade relations. While it has been **successful in reducing trade barriers**, it faces **significant challenges** like **protectionism, lack of enforcement, and unfair treatment of developing nations**. Going forward, **reforming the dispute resolution system, addressing digital trade, and making trade policies more inclusive** will be critical for the WTO’s survival and effectiveness in the 21st century.

# An India-U.S. trade agreement and the test of WTO laws

### **An India-U.S. Trade Agreement and the Test of WTO Laws**  

The India-U.S. trade relationship has undergone significant transformation over the years, with both countries engaging in negotiations to address market access issues, tariff barriers, and trade imbalances. However, any bilateral trade agreement between India and the U.S. must conform to the legal framework set by the World Trade Organization (WTO), which governs global trade. This article explores the implications of an India-U.S. trade agreement under WTO laws, highlighting key challenges and compliance issues.  

---

### **India-U.S. Trade Relations: An Overview**  

India and the U.S. have strong economic ties, with bilateral trade exceeding $190 billion in 2022. The U.S. is one of India's largest trading partners, and India is a major supplier of pharmaceuticals, textiles, IT services, and agricultural products to the U.S. Despite this robust trade, disputes over tariffs, market access, and WTO compliance have often created tensions. The withdrawal of India's **Generalized System of Preferences (GSP)** status by the U.S. in 2019 and India's retaliatory tariffs illustrate the complexities of this trade relationship.  

The two nations have been negotiating a **limited trade package** that could potentially pave the way for a broader **Free Trade Agreement (FTA)** in the future. However, such an agreement must align with WTO regulations, which are designed to prevent discriminatory trade practices and ensure fair competition.  

---

### **WTO Principles and Compliance Issues**  

The WTO framework mandates that trade agreements between member nations must adhere to its principles, primarily:  

1. **Most-Favored Nation (MFN) Principle:**  
   - According to Article 1 of the **General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)**, any trade benefit granted to one WTO member must be extended to all other members.  
   - A bilateral agreement between India and the U.S. would need to justify exceptions under WTO provisions, such as forming a **Regional Trade Agreement (RTA)** or being part of a broader **Free Trade Agreement (FTA)**.  

2. **National Treatment Obligation:**  
   - Under Article III of GATT, foreign products must be treated on par with domestic goods once they enter the market.  
   - If India and the U.S. offer preferential treatment to each other’s goods and services in a way that disadvantages other WTO members, they could face legal challenges.  

3. **Tariff and Non-Tariff Barriers:**  
   - The U.S. has criticized India's high tariffs on **automobiles, medical devices, and agricultural products**.  
   - India has raised concerns over **U.S. protectionist policies** and higher tariffs on steel and aluminum, which were imposed under **Section 232 of the U.S. Trade Expansion Act**.  

4. **Dispute Settlement Mechanism:**  
   - WTO's **Dispute Settlement Body (DSB)** has been a platform where India and the U.S. have filed complaints against each other.  
   - If the new trade agreement conflicts with WTO obligations, it could be challenged through this mechanism.  

---

### **Way Forward: Balancing Bilateralism and Multilateralism**  

- **Negotiating WTO-Compliant Exceptions:**  
  - India and the U.S. could structure their agreement under **Article XXIV of GATT**, which allows for Free Trade Agreements, provided they cover "substantially all trade."  
  - Special provisions can also be invoked under **Article XXI (National Security Exception)** or **Article XII (Balance of Payments Crisis Justification)**.  

- **Harmonization of Standards:**  
  - Both countries need to align their regulatory standards in areas such as **intellectual property rights, labor laws, and environmental regulations** to avoid potential WTO disputes.  

- **Leveraging WTO Reform Discussions:**  
  - Given that the WTO is facing institutional challenges, India and the U.S. can work together on **dispute resolution reforms** to create a more predictable trade environment.  

---

### **Conclusion**  

An India-U.S. trade agreement must carefully navigate WTO rules while addressing mutual trade concerns. While both nations seek to enhance bilateral trade, they must ensure that their agreement does not violate WTO principles related to **non-discrimination, tariff reductions, and dispute settlement**. Given the rising trend of protectionism, a well-crafted trade deal that aligns with global trade norms can serve as a model for other economies and reinforce India's position in the multilateral trading system.

> An India-U.S. trade agreement must align with WTO laws, ensuring compliance with **Most-Favored Nation (MFN) rules, National Treatment Obligations, and tariff regulations**. While both nations seek to address trade imbalances and market access issues, challenges include **high tariffs, protectionist policies, and regulatory differences**. Any agreement must fit within WTO exceptions, such as **Article XXIV for Free Trade Agreements**. Dispute settlement remains a key concern, with both countries having filed cases against each other. A balanced approach, harmonizing trade standards and leveraging WTO reforms, can help India and the U.S. strengthen bilateral ties while maintaining global trade commitments.
