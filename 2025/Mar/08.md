# Inclusion in public spaces — from fear to freedom

India is often considered to be one of the most unsafe countries for women, a reality that demands urgent and deliberate change. India was ranked 128 among 177 countries rated in Women, Peace and Security Index 2023. While deeply entrenched patriarchal norms that lead to violence cannot be dismantled overnight, meaningful progress can be made by challenging the everyday barriers that women face. On International Women’s Day today, it is crucial to reflect on a fundamental but an often-ignored issue — the accessibility of public spaces for women.

While the topic is deeply studied and researched in the academic world, very little has changed practically. For instance, how many women do we see on roads when compared to men at any given point of time? Which are the spaces where they are more visible? And which are the areas which they completely avoid? How freely can women walk on the streets? Or do women consciously regulate their body language to conform to the male gaze?

### Gendered spatial control

It is important to understand them because public spaces serve as arenas where socio-economic life thrives and evolves through mutual interactions and collective experiences, shaping community identities and social dynamics. It is where people cultivate political identities, build livelihoods, and actively engage in community life. By enthusiastically participating in the everyday nuances of public spaces, individuals get more integrated into societal processes. Moreover, a key indicator of a place’s safety is the presence of women freely choosing to relax and enjoy themselves there.

What impacts women’s mobilities? Studies indicate that public spaces are both gendered and political where a majority of women are mostly confined to the private and domestic sphere. This gendered spatial control takes place in many ways. According to National Family Health Survey-4 (NFHS-4) data (2015–16), 54% of Indian women had the freedom to visit markets alone, while 50% could access health-care facilities independently, and 48% were permitted to travel outside their village or community unaccompanied.

Also, the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) for 2023-24 indicates that the Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR) for women is 35.6%. Even though it has risen significantly over the years, unfortunately, this highlights that more than half the female population remains outside the workforce. Therefore, while a majority of women are confined to private spaces, there is a rising number of women who are using public spaces.

However, for working women, public spaces primarily serve as transitional zones, facilitating their commute between home and workplace. These spaces are rarely utilised for leisure or recreation. Consequently, women’s engagement with public spaces is purpose-driven and time-bound, reinforcing spatial restrictions that limit their presence to functional necessities rather than unrestricted social participation.

A space is truly safe and inclusive when women can navigate it freely and without hesitation. As argued in ‘Why Loiter?’ (Phadke, Ranade, Khan, 2011), reclaiming public spaces is not just about necessity but also about leisure and uninhibited presence. When women can move without a purpose, without urgency, without having to conform to the male gaze, they assert their right to belong, transforming public spaces into shared, equitable environments. Simply put, women should be able to just exist in public spaces.

### The issue of safety

During such instances, the issue of women’s safety becomes a pressing concern. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that violence against women is not confined to public spaces as many face threats even within their homes which is considered to be a comparatively safer space. In open spaces, the risk of gendered violence from multiple strangers is high. This has reinforced the belief that women need protection, ultimately restricting their autonomy. As a result, women are largely found in curated spaces such as malls, theatres, and cafes, where the likelihood of violence is perceived to be lower. But what about women on footpaths, bus stations, or narrow streets — just a group of girls sitting around and having fun?

Street amusement where women are the participants is not a normal sight. Everyday public spaces — those that men navigate freely — continue to be unwelcoming to women. The fact that women cannot simply exist in these spaces without discomfort or fear raises a critical question. What is fundamentally flawed in the design of public spaces that prevents women from fully claiming and navigating them as their own? It is here that the community and the government can be great enablers. As a society, we must acknowledge and accept the fact that public spaces offer a sense of freedom. Yet, this very freedom often translates to a loss of control for families over women’s mobility. Risk is inevitable but avoiding public spaces is not the solution. Men are subjected to street violence as well, even though their nature of vulnerability is different from that of women. Women need to reclaim these spaces with the same ease as men, fostering autonomy rather than restriction. For this, women should have more conversations about this problem, take out time to go around and ‘hang out’ and have fun in public spaces. Normalising a woman’s use of public space for leisure can contribute to this shift.

### Policy level changes

At the policy level, the government can drive change by reimagining public space planning and design. This includes improving street lighting, ensuring safe and accessible public toilets, installing street furniture such as benches, and creating more recreational spaces tailored for women. Another critical area requiring government intervention is strengthening public safety through stringent laws and their effective enforcement to address crimes against women in public spaces. How many men are actually punished for gender-based violence in public spaces? How many secure bail, only to repeat their crimes? The low conviction rate remains a glaring issue that must be addressed. Even today, women are often blamed for being in the “wrong place at the wrong time”, shifting the focus from the perpetrator to the victim. Society places the burden of safety on women while simultaneously excusing or downplaying the actions of offenders. This not only fosters a culture of impunity but also reinforces a gendered fear that serves as a tool for patriarchal control.

So, by consciously reshaping public spaces, we can create environments where women feel safe and truly welcome. While centuries of patriarchy cannot be dismantled overnight, meaningful change begins with small, everyday actions. From the built environment of public space to societal attitudes, every shift, no matter how gradual, brings us closer to an inclusive society where women can navigate and own public spaces freely, without fear or restriction.

# An equitable future for women in science, in India

Women in science navigate a minefield of challenges that often start early. Educational barriers, such as limited access to quality schools and gendered societal norms, can discourage girls from pursuing science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). For those who persist and are fortunate to get past these early hurdles, cultural expectations frequently demand that they prioritise family over careers, severely jeopardising professional growth. Gender stereotypes further restrict opportunities, affecting hiring, promotions and funding. Harassment and discrimination in academic settings add another dimension of hostility that push many women out of the field.

### A study of STEM scientists

Globally, as well as in India, we see similar patterns. A study of STEM scientists across 38 countries reveals higher attrition rates for women, driven by non-inclusive workplaces, work-life balance struggles, and limited access to high-impact research.

These barriers slow career progression and reduce access to senior roles and professional networks, increasing dropout rates. The postdoc-to-faculty transition is especially challenging for women, with familial responsibilities, low confidence, and a lack of female role models cited as key factors, as highlighted by research from the National Institutes of Health.

These barriers compel us to consider why it is vital to prioritise the retention of women in science. Diverse teams drive creativity and innovation, leading to breakthroughs by integrating multiple perspectives. More women in science also results in role models for future generations, inspiring girls to pursue STEM. Promoting equity ensures that women can contribute fully to scientific progress, enriching society with a more inclusive workforce.

This conversation has progressed little over the centuries. The “Matilda Effect” — named after 19th-century feminist Matilda Joslyn Gage — describes the tendency to downplay or overshadow women’s scientific contributions in favour of their male colleagues, highlighting the historic struggle for proper recognition of women’s innovations. Nearly 200 years later, gender inequity in STEM persists. Jacob Clark Blickenstaff’s “leaky pipeline” metaphor describes women dropping out of STEM due to biased pedagogy, a lack of role models, and hostile workplaces. Critiqued as somewhat simplistic, this model does not consider systemic power dynamics. A more recent “Chutes and Ladders” model focuses on broader structural and environmental barriers, highlighting how mentorship, access to hidden knowledge, and career disruptions disproportionately hinder women, minorities, and marginalised groups, emphasising the need to address inequities within academic systems.

### A survey across India

Examining these concepts is particularly valuable in the context of India, where conservative attitudes abound. In an extensive survey across 98 institutions across India conducted in 2020-21, the proportion of women faculty members across all the fields was a mere 17%, ranging from 23% in biology to 8% in engineering. The proportion was even lower within higher-ranked institutions, with dwindling ratios within senior career faculty. The data showed that women scientists were vastly under-represented at conferences and often overlooked in career-enhancing activities.

Addressing these challenges demands a reimagined approach that embraces diverse career paths and involves policymakers, institutions, and the scientific community in fostering inclusivity, particularly for underrepresented and economically disadvantaged women. Approaches vary based on the timing of intervention. Early intervention, engaging parents, educators, and the broader social environment, is key to lasting impact.

We propose three key recommendations to improve the retention of women in STEM at the early- and mid-career levels. First, institutional changes such as flexible work options, affordable childcare, and policies supporting work-family integration are essential. Second, public recognition of both triumphs and obstacles is crucial. Showcasing successful women in science challenges stereotypes, inspires the next generation, and reinforces the need for greater visibility and representation. At the same time, calling out setbacks, as exemplified by BiasWatchIndia, can drive incremental progress by exposing gender inequities in academia. Finally, a nuanced approach across career stages is crucial, eliminating age restrictions on grants, fostering mentorship networks, supporting career re-entry after a break for family or personal reasons, and amplifying senior women’s voices in leadership and decision-making.

### Interventions

The Indian government has taken significant steps to advance gender equity in science and technology. The Department of Science and Technology (DST) launched the Gender Advancement for Transforming Institutions (GATI) pilot in 2020 to foster an inclusive environment for women and gender-diverse individuals in STEM, supporting participation-boosting initiatives such as the Women in Science and Engineering-Knowledge Involvement in Research Advancement through Nurturing, or WISE-KIRAN, and the Women Scientists Scheme (WOS) programmes. Noteworthy efforts include the Department of Biotechnology’s Biotechnology Career Advancement and Re-orientation (BioCARe) programme, which supports women scientists returning to research after career breaks.

Additionally, the Indian Council of Medical Research spearheads several programmes promoting women’s health and training for women scientists. While these initiatives reflect progress, they must scale into broader reforms to ensure that women scientists are recognised, empowered, and valued.

As India continues to push the boundaries of scientific and technological advancement, the full inclusion of women in this journey is not only a matter of fairness but also an example of true progress that can set a powerful example for the world to emulate.

> **"An Equitable Future for Women in Science in India"** emphasizes the need for **gender parity, equal opportunities, and institutional support** for women in STEM. Despite growing participation, challenges like **gender bias, work-life balance issues, lack of leadership roles, and funding disparities** persist. Key solutions include **mentorship programs, flexible work policies, research grants for women, and stronger representation in decision-making bodies**. Government initiatives like **GATI (Gender Advancement for Transforming Institutions)** and **WISE (Women in Science and Engineering)** aim to bridge gaps. Creating an **inclusive, bias-free ecosystem** will empower women in science, fostering **innovation and national progress**.
