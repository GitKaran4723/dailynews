# COP29, climate finance and its optical illusion

Finance has been a major point of climate change negotiation since the launching of the United Nations-led climate change negotiations in 1991, producing the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 1992. Article 4 (7) of the UNFCCC clearly says “that the extent to which the developing country Party will be fulfilling their climate action commitments is contingent on how much finance and technology they get from developed country Parties”.

The Paris Agreement retains, in Article 9(1), the provision relating to finance, binding the developed countries to mobilise finance for the developing countries. The sixth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has described finance, capacity-building and a transfer of technology as critical enablers of climate action in developing countries in the backdrop of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions responsible for 1.1° Celsius of warming (above what it was in 1850-1900) in 2011-20.

### Falling short

In pursuance of their responsibility, the developed countries agreed in 2009 that they would collectively mobilise $100 billion a year by 2020. The $100 billion mark, met by the developed countries only in 2022, does not match the growing needs of climate finance corresponding to the developing countries’ nationally determined contributions (NDCs).

Second, the mark has been considered in many reports to be well-short of estimated finance to fund the actions needed across different sectors to keep the average global temperature rise within 1.5° Celsius by the end of this century. The 29th Conference of the Parties (COP 29) meeting at Baku, Azerbaijan, in November 2024, was meant for the Parties to the Paris Agreement to have a New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance (NCQG), replacing a $100 billion floor and laying a new floor taking into account the needs and the priorities of developing countries to tackle the climate crisis.

In response to persistent demand by all the major negotiating groups belonging to the developing south that the developed north mobilise $1.3 trillion by 2030, the developed north agreed to release only $300 billion per year by 2035.The $300 billion mark ignores the estimation by the UNFCCC’s Standing Committee on Finance (SFC) relating to the annual financial needs of developing countries, which it derived from their NDCs. As in the SFC’s estimation, the financial needs stand at between $455 billion-$584 billion. Even these figures cover around half of the 5,760 costed and non-costed needs identified by 98 developing countries in their NDCs (Third Report of the Independent High-level Expert Group on Climate Finance, November, 2024).

The decision on the NCQG makes reference to the financial needs of those particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change such as the least developed countries (LDC) and small island developing states (SIDS). But the NCQG does not make minimum allocation floors for the LDCs and SIDS.

During the meeting, the Alliance of Small Island States demanded the allocation of $39 billion for SIDS while the LDC demanded at least $220 billion for them. It appears that the first-ever Global Stocktake (GST) in consonance with the Paris Agreement in 2023 also failed in influencing the cause of loss and damage concern in the NCQG. In the GST estimation, economic costs are estimated to reach $447 billion-$894 billion per year by 2030.

### India and the NCQG

India’s perspective on the delivery of climate finance from the developed north to the developing south is derived from equity frame expressed in the principle of common but differentiated responsibility and respective capability. It is notable that India joined the Montreal Protocol to protect the ozone layer from further depletion, which led to setting up of a multilateral fund of $240 million, including an additional $80 million for use in India, China and other eligible low-income Parties. During COP29, India specified that the new floor should mobilise $1.3 trillion by 2030, of which at least $600 billion should come in the form of grants and concessional resources. On other major agenda items, mitigation work programme, just transition work programme and GST, India’s representative called for an adequate provisioning of finance and other means of implementation to fulfil them. India’s submission of NDC next year is contingent on a decision relating to finance (Earth Negotiations Bulletin—, November 22, 2024).

India has expressed its extreme disappointment on the adoption of the NCQG in its present form, shape — which was without its consultation. It made serious objections against the COP29 presidency and the Secretariat in the way it was finalised — which is at the expense of trust, collaboration and in contravention of the UNFCCC’s norm, on an issue which is a creation of the developed north but which affects developing countries more. India outrightly rejected the NCQG. It also added that this NCQG expects the developing world to mobilise resources. In India’s view, the paltry sum will influence the ambition and the implementation of its NDC.

### What the developed north must do

The pith and substance of the Paris Agreement are the NDCs. In expecting the developing south to bring out more ambitious NDCs relating to the mitigation of greenhouse gases and implementing the same effectively, it is equally important on the part of the developed north to raise their scale and quality of climate finance and also make sincere efforts in putting in place a coherent climate finance architecture.

This will ensure adequate, directly accessible and affordable climate finance to the developing countries.

The **29th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP29)**, held in **Baku, Azerbaijan**, concluded with an agreement to mobilize **$300 billion annually by 2035** to assist developing nations in addressing climate change. While this commitment represents a significant increase from previous pledges, it has been met with criticism from poorer nations and climate activists who argue that it falls short of the necessary funding to effectively combat climate challenges.

**Criticism from Developing Nations:**

Developing countries have expressed dissatisfaction with the agreed-upon amount, emphasizing that it is insufficient to meet the escalating costs of climate mitigation and adaptation. Many had advocated for a minimum target of **$500 billion annually**, citing the increasing frequency and severity of climate-related disasters that disproportionately affect vulnerable populations. The **Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS)** and the **African Group of Negotiators** were particularly vocal, describing the deal as inadequate and a potential "death sentence" for millions facing existential threats from climate change. 

**Concerns Over Implementation and Equity:**

Critics have also raised concerns about the sources and distribution of the pledged funds. The agreement indicates that financing will be sourced from both public and private sectors, with developed countries leading the contributions and developing nations encouraged to participate voluntarily. This structure has led to apprehensions regarding the reliability and accessibility of the funds, especially for the least developed countries that may struggle to attract private investment. Additionally, there is unease about the potential for financial mechanisms that could increase the debt burden of recipient nations, rather than providing grants or concessional financing. 

**Geopolitical Tensions and Trust Deficit:**

The negotiations at COP29 were marked by geopolitical tensions, with some developing nations accusing wealthier countries of not fulfilling previous commitments and attempting to shift financial responsibilities. The re-election of **Donald Trump** as U.S. President added to the uncertainty, given his prior skepticism towards international climate agreements. Such dynamics have exacerbated the trust deficit between developed and developing countries, complicating consensus-building and collaborative action. 

**Optical Illusion of Progress:**

While the headline figure of $300 billion suggests substantial progress, many experts view it as an "optical illusion" that masks underlying inadequacies. The lack of clear timelines, concrete implementation strategies, and accountability mechanisms raises doubts about the effectiveness of the pledged funds in delivering tangible climate action. Furthermore, the reliance on private sector contributions introduces uncertainties related to profit motives and equitable allocation of resources.

**Call for Enhanced Climate Finance:**

In light of these concerns, there is a growing call for a more ambitious and transparent approach to climate finance. This includes setting higher funding targets that align with the actual needs of developing countries, ensuring that contributions are predominantly in the form of grants to avoid exacerbating debt issues, and establishing robust monitoring systems to track the disbursement and utilization of funds. Additionally, expanding the donor base to include emerging economies with significant financial capabilities could enhance the pool of available resources.

**Conclusion:**

The climate finance agreement reached at COP29, while a step forward, has been criticized for not adequately addressing the pressing needs of developing nations facing the brunt of climate change. The perceived disparity between pledged amounts and actual requirements underscores the necessity for more substantial commitments, equitable financial mechanisms, and genuine collaboration to effectively tackle the global climate crisis.

> At **COP29** in **Baku**, nations agreed to mobilize **$300 billion annually by 2035** to help developing countries combat climate change. However, this pledge has been criticized as insufficient, with vulnerable nations demanding at least **$500 billion**. Concerns persist over the reliability of funding, heavy reliance on private sector contributions, and potential debt burdens for poorer nations. Critics view the commitment as an "optical illusion" lacking clear timelines and accountability. To ensure meaningful climate action, stronger financial commitments, transparent mechanisms, and equitable distribution of funds are essential to support vulnerable countries facing escalating climate threats.

# Are former Prime Ministers mandated memorials?

Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh passed away on December 26. The Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) declared seven days of State mourning and announced a state funeral for the dignitary. Mr. Singh was cremated at the Nigambodh Ghat in central Delhi, a first for any former PM. The Congress party said it was an “insult” that a separate place was not allocated by the government for the funeral of the former PM. The Congress party demanded that a memorial be built at the designated place where the cremation took place.

### Is there a rule related to memorials?

While guidelines exist for State funerals, there is no specific rule or government order regarding allocation of space for memorials for former PMs. According to constitutional expert P.D.T Achary, there was a departure in the case of Mr. Singh. “As far as I know, there is no such rule. The convention is that former PMs have been cremated at designated places and in this case there is a departure. They cremated him at a place where anybody can be cremated even a common man. In our country though everyone is equal before the law, in society, a former PM has a status and especially a person like Manmohan Singh who was also globally respected,” Mr. Achary said.

### What has been the trend in the past?

Except PM Vishwanath Pratap Singh, all other former PMs have memorials dedicated to them, majorly in Delhi and other parts of the country.

P. V. Narasimha Rao got a memorial in his name at Ekta Sthal in Delhi in 2015, 10 years after his death in 2004. In Delhi, the samadhi of Jawaharlal Nehru is known as Shanti Vana, Lal Bahadur Shastri’s memorial is known as Vijay Ghat, that of Charan Singh’s is Kisan Ghat, Indira Gandhi’s memorial is at Shakti Sthal, and Rajiv Gandhi’s memorial is known as Vir Bhumi. In 2013, due to paucity of space, the Congress government decided that all memorials will be built at Smriti Sthal.

### Who maintains the memorials?

According to a reply furnished by the Culture Ministry on December 11, 2012 in Lok Sabha, the memorials of various personalities are maintained by the respective State Governments and local municipalities. “However, the Central Government through the Ministry of Urban Development is looking after the upkeep and maintenance of the Samadhis adjacent to Rajghat, New Delhi, Morarji Desai’s Samadhi at Abhay Ghat at Ahmedabad and the Rajiv Gandhi Memorial at Sriperumbudur (Tamil Nadu),” the reply stated.

### What is the Congress’s demand?

On December 27, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, requesting the Union Government to identify a designated place where the last rites of the departed leader could be held and a memorial built thereafter. Despite the request, the cremation was held at Nigambodh Ghat on December 28. Following an uproar, the MHA released a press statement on December 27 at 11.45 pm. It stated that the government received a request to allocate space for a memorial for the former Prime Minister. “Immediately after the Cabinet meeting, Home Minister Amit Shah communicated to Congress President Kharge and the family of Late Dr Manmohan Singh that the Government will allocate space for the memorial. In the meanwhile cremation and other formalities can happen because a Trust has to be formed and space has to be allocated to it,” the statement said. Till December 30, the memorial for Mr. Singh had not been announced. Atal Bihari Vajpayee who passed on August 16, 2018 was cremated at Smriti Sthal, and a memorial came up at the same place within 45 days. The memorial was funded by the “Atal Smriti Nyas Society”. It was built at a total cost of ₹10.51 crore which was borne entirely by the society.

> Former Prime Ministers of India are **not legally mandated** to have memorials. The decision to establish a memorial is based on government discretion, reflecting the leader’s contributions and public sentiment. While some leaders like **Jawaharlal Nehru** and **Indira Gandhi** have memorials, others do not. The **Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs** and related authorities evaluate proposals for memorials without any constitutional or legal requirement. Memorials are typically built to honor leaders with significant historical impact, but it is not an automatic or obligatory process for all former Prime Ministers.
