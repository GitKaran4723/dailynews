# Rat-hole mining: why the practice continues in spite of its hazards

An oral question from the Supreme Court to the Union government continues to remain unanswered even as rescue workers recover bodies of workers who died trapped in a flood rat-hole coal mine at Dima Hasao district in Assam. On January 11, 2019, the top court had asked whether rat-hole mines could possibly operate in the northeast hills without the “connivance” of officials. “Lives are lost due to illegal mining. What about the officials who allowed this to happen?" the court had asked the government.

### What is rat-hole mining?

Rat-hole mining, of two types, is so named as it involves digging tunnels 3-4 feet deep, barely allowing workers to crawl in and out. They have to squat while extracting coal with pickaxes. The side-cutting type of mining is usually done on hill slopes by following a coal seam — dark brown or black-banded coal deposited within layers of rock— visible from the outside. The second type called box-cutting entails digging a circular or squarish pit at least 5 sq. metre in width up to a depth of 400 feet. Miners who drop down in makeshift cranes or using rope-and-bamboo ladders dig horizontally after finding the coal seam. The tunnels are dug in every direction from the edge of the pit, resembling the tentacles of an octopus. Some workers from Assam lost their lives in the coal mines of Meghalaya, dug using this crude method, before and after the National Green Tribunal (NGT) banned it in April 2014.

### Why is such mining banned?

The government has little control over the land in Meghalaya, a Sixth Schedule State where the Coal Mines Nationalisation Act of 1973 does not apply. The landowners are thus also the owners of the minerals beneath. Coal mining boomed after Meghalaya attained statehood in January 1972. However, the terrain and expenses involved discouraged mine owners from employing advanced drilling machines. So, labourers mainly from Assam, Nepal, and adjoining Bangladesh risked the hazards of rat-hole mining — asphyxiation because of poor ventilation, collapse of mines due to lack of structural support, and flooding — to earn thrice or four times as much as working in farms or construction sites. Apart from issues of safety and health, unregulated mining led to land degradation, deforestation, and water with high concentrations of sulphates, iron, and toxic heavy metals, low dissolved oxygen, and high biochemical oxygen demand. At least two rivers, Lukha and Myntdu, became too acidic to sustain aquatic life. These factors led to the NGT banning rat-hole mining in Meghalaya in 2014 while observing: “...there is umpteen number of cases where, by virtue of rat-hole mining, during the rainy season, water flooded into the mining areas resulting in the death of many...” Illegal mining and transportation of coal, as mentioned in the interim reports of a one-man committee appointed by the High Court of Meghalaya, has continued despite the ban and the loss of lives. At least 17 miners were drowned in an illegal mine in the East Jaintia Hills district’s Ksan in December 2018 after water gushed in from a river.

### What led to the NGT ban?

Environmentalists and human rights activists began flagging the hazards of rat-hole mining in Meghalaya two decades ago. The campaign intensified after Impulse, a Meghalaya-based NGO, began addressing the issue of human trafficking and child labour in such mines.

Three reports prepared by the NGO, first with the Nepal-based Esther Benjamin Trust in May 2010, the second with Aide et Action in December 2010, and the last with Human Rights Now in July 2011, estimated that about 70,000 children mostly from Bangladesh and Nepal were employed in these mines because they were the right size to work in them. The State’s Department of Mining and Geology refuted the claim but, under pressure from the National Human Rights Commission, admitted in June 2013 that 222 children were employed in rat-hole mines, specifically in the East Jaintia Hills district. The NGT ban came a year later.

### What is the way forward?

Unlike in Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, coal seams in Meghalaya are very thin. This, miners say, makes rat-hole mining more economically viable than opencast mining.

The State has an estimated reserve of 576.48 million tonnes of low-ash, high-sulphur coal belonging to the Eocene age (33-56 million years ago). The stakes for a section of locals have been so high that the State government has been under pressure to facilitate the resumption of mining legally.

In May 2023, Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad K. Sangma said the Coal Ministry approved mining leases for four of the 17 prospective licence applicants. This would lead to the commencement of ‘scientific’ mining ensuring minimal environmental impact through sustainable and legally compliant extraction procedures. Anti-mining activists, who are assaulted by miners off and on, said that ‘scientific’ would eventually be a fancy tag in a State where profit has driven coal mining.

> **Rat-hole mining** is an illegal and hazardous method of coal extraction prevalent in Meghalaya, India, where narrow tunnels are dug to extract coal. Despite being banned by the **National Green Tribunal (NGT)** in 2014 due to environmental damage and frequent fatalities, it persists due to high coal demand, lack of alternative livelihoods, and weak enforcement. The region's challenging terrain and socio-economic dependence on mining make regulation difficult. Corruption, political influence, and inadequate oversight further enable this practice. Without sustainable economic alternatives and stricter enforcement, rat-hole mining continues despite its severe environmental and human safety risks.

# Inflation falls to a 4-month low in Dec.

### **What is Inflation?**  
Inflation refers to the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services rises, eroding purchasing power. It is commonly measured by indices such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Wholesale Price Index (WPI).

- **Moderate Inflation:** Can encourage economic growth by stimulating production and consumption.  
- **High Inflation:** Reduces the value of money, increasing the cost of living.  
- **Deflation (Negative Inflation):** Indicates a decrease in prices, which can lead to economic slowdown.  

---

### **Why is Inflation Increasing in India?**

1. **Supply Chain Disruptions:** Global and domestic supply chains have been disrupted due to geopolitical tensions, the COVID-19 pandemic, and logistical bottlenecks.  
2. **Rising Crude Oil Prices:** India imports a significant portion of its crude oil. Rising global oil prices increase transportation and production costs.  
3. **Food Inflation:** Weather irregularities, such as unseasonal rains or droughts, impact agricultural output, leading to rising food prices.  
4. **Currency Depreciation:** A weaker rupee makes imports costlier, adding to inflation.  
5. **Global Commodity Price Surge:** Increased prices of metals, fertilizers, and food grains globally impact domestic prices.  
6. **High Demand Post-Pandemic:** Recovery in demand after the pandemic, coupled with supply constraints, has pushed prices up.  

---

### **Remedies by the RBI and the Government**

#### **Measures by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI):**

1. **Monetary Policy Adjustments:**  
   - **Repo Rate Hikes:** Increasing the repo rate (the rate at which banks borrow from the RBI) makes borrowing costlier, reducing money supply and curbing demand-driven inflation.  
   - **Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR):** Raising the CRR reduces liquidity in the banking system.  
   - **Monetary Tightening:** Reducing money supply to control inflationary pressures.  

2. **Liquidity Management:**  
   - Using tools like **Open Market Operations (OMO)** to manage liquidity.  
   - **Sterilization of capital flows** to prevent excess liquidity.  

3. **Inflation Targeting Framework:**  
   - RBI maintains inflation within the target range of **4% ± 2%** as per the agreement with the government.  

---

#### **Measures by the Government of India:**

1. **Supply-Side Reforms:**  
   - **Import Duty Reductions:** Lowering import duties on essential commodities (e.g., edible oils) to reduce prices.  
   - **Buffer Stock Management:** Releasing food grains from government reserves to stabilize prices.  

2. **Export Restrictions:**  
   - Imposing export bans or restrictions on essential commodities to ensure domestic availability (e.g., wheat, sugar).  

3. **Subsidies:**  
   - Providing subsidies on fertilizers, fuel, and essential items to ease inflation impact on consumers.  

4. **Infrastructure Development:**  
   - Investing in supply chain and storage infrastructure to reduce wastage and price volatility.  

5. **Targeted Welfare Schemes:**  
   - Expanding schemes like **PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY)** to provide free food grains to the vulnerable sections.  

---

### **Current Scenario:**  
If inflation has dropped to a 4-month low in December, it likely indicates that some of these measures are showing results, particularly in controlling food and fuel prices. However, sustained efforts are necessary to manage structural inflation in the long run.

> Inflation is the rise in the general price level of goods and services, reducing purchasing power. In India, inflation has increased due to supply chain disruptions, rising crude oil prices, food inflation, currency depreciation, and global commodity price surges. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) combats inflation by raising the repo rate, adjusting the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR), and managing liquidity. The government addresses it through import duty cuts, buffer stock releases, export restrictions, subsidies, and welfare schemes. A recent drop in inflation to a 4-month low suggests these measures are yielding positive results in stabilizing prices.

| **Claws**                 | Semi-retractable claws for grip during sprints | Fully retractable claws for climbing and stealth |
| **Hunting Style**         | Hunts during the day (diurnal), relies on speed | Hunts mainly at night (nocturnal), relies on stealth |
| **Body Markings**         | Solid black spots on a tan coat              | Rosette-shaped spots with central shading |
| **Facial Markings**       | Black "tear marks" from eyes to mouth        | No tear marks, rosette spots extend to face |
| **Habitat**               | Open grasslands and savannas                | Forests, grasslands, mountains, and near human settlements |
| **Climbing Ability**      | Poor climber                                | Excellent climber                        |
| **Strength**              | Less muscular, built for speed              | Strong and muscular, capable of dragging heavy prey |
| **Behavior**              | Non-aggressive, avoids confrontation        | Aggressive and territorial              |
| **Social Structure**      | Males may form small groups; females are solitary | Mostly solitary, except during mating or with cubs |
| **Conservation Status**   | Vulnerable (Asiatic cheetah is critically endangered) | Vulnerable                                |
| **Geographical Range**    | Africa and recently reintroduced in India   | Africa and Asia (widely distributed)    |

**Key Differences:**  
- Cheetahs are built for speed, while leopards are built for strength and stealth.  
- Cheetahs prefer open plains, while leopards adapt to diverse habitats.  
- Cheetahs hunt during the day; leopards are primarily nocturnal hunters.

### **Male and Female Cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus)**

**1. Physical Differences:**  
- **Size:** Male cheetahs are slightly larger and more muscular than females.  
- **Weight:** Males weigh between **40–65 kg**, while females weigh around **35–45 kg**.  
- **Build:** Males have a broader head and thicker necks due to their social behavior.  

**2. Social Behavior:**  
- **Males:** Often form **small coalitions** (usually with brothers or other males) to hunt and defend territory. This improves hunting success and territory defense.  
- **Females:** Are **solitary**, except when raising cubs. They have large home ranges and frequently move to find food.  

**3. Reproduction and Parenting:**  
- **Females** are solely responsible for raising cubs. They give birth to **3–5 cubs** and care for them for about **18 months**.  
- **Males** have no role in cub rearing and focus on territory defense and mating.  

---

### **Male and Female Leopards (Panthera pardus)**

**1. Physical Differences:**  
- **Size:** Male leopards are larger and more muscular than females.  
- **Weight:** Males weigh between **50–90 kg**, while females weigh **30–60 kg**.  
- **Appearance:** Males have broader heads and thicker necks compared to females.  

**2. Social Behavior:**  
- **Males:** Are highly **territorial** and solitary, defending larger territories that overlap with several female territories.  
- **Females:** Also solitary, except when raising cubs, but they are less territorial and often move within male territories.  

**3. Reproduction and Parenting:**  
- **Females** raise cubs alone, typically giving birth to **2–3 cubs** in a hidden den.  
- **Males** have no involvement in cub rearing but may protect their offspring indirectly by defending their territory from rival males.  

---

### **Key Differences Between Male and Female Cheetahs and Leopards:**  
- **Social Behavior:** Male cheetahs form coalitions, while male leopards are strictly solitary.  
- **Territorial Nature:** Male leopards aggressively defend large territories; male cheetahs may share territories within coalitions.  
- **Parental Roles:** In both species, **females** are solely responsible for cub rearing, while **males** focus on territory and mating.

> Leopards, adaptable and solitary predators, are found across Africa and Asia, including India, and often venture near human settlements due to habitat loss. Cheetahs, native to Africa and reintroduced in India, are diurnal hunters known for their speed. Human-wildlife conflicts, like the leopard attacks in Himachal Pradesh, can be mitigated through habitat conservation, wildlife corridors, community awareness, non-lethal deterrents, scientific monitoring, eco-tourism, and rapid response teams. Compensation for livestock loss and strict legal protection further discourage retaliation against wildlife, promoting peaceful coexistence between humans and animals.

# The Trump card, global politics and outcomes for India

### **Analysis of Trump's "America First" Doctrine and Its Global Impact**

Donald Trump's **"America First"** doctrine prioritizes U.S. national interests over global cooperation, challenging the **rules-based international order**. His approach involves skepticism toward multilateral institutions, withdrawal from international agreements, and a preference for bilateral deals. This transactional and protectionist stance is likely to reshape global geopolitics, trade, and international diplomacy.

---

### **Impact on Globalization**

1. **Rise in Protectionism:**  
   - Increased tariffs and trade wars, particularly with China, could slow global trade.  
   - Reduced global supply chain integration and reshoring of industries to the U.S. may fragment markets.  

2. **Decline in Multilateralism:**  
   - Weakening of global institutions like the **UN**, **WTO**, and **NATO** may erode global cooperation.  
   - Countries may turn to regional alliances and unilateral actions, reducing the effectiveness of global governance.  

3. **Climate Action Setbacks:**  
   - U.S. withdrawal from climate agreements like the **Paris Accord** may slow global climate efforts.  
   - Developing countries may face challenges securing climate funding and technology transfers.  

4. **Geopolitical Tensions:**  
   - Intensified U.S.-China rivalry could divide global alliances, impacting global stability.  
   - Expansion of Russian and Chinese influence in regions like the **Indo-Pacific** could destabilize security dynamics.  

---

### **Impact on India**

1. **Economic Challenges:**  
   - **Trade Restrictions:** Higher U.S. tariffs and reduced market access could hurt India’s exports, especially in textiles, IT services, and pharmaceuticals.  
   - **Supply Chain Disruptions:** Global protectionism could disrupt India's role in global supply chains, impacting manufacturing and technology sectors.  

2. **Geopolitical Implications:**  
   - **Indo-Pacific Strategy:** Reduced U.S. engagement in Asia might pressure India to counterbalance China's growing influence alone.  
   - **Defense Relations:** U.S. isolationism could impact defense partnerships, although India may seek to strengthen ties through bilateral deals.  

3. **Technology and Immigration:**  
   - **H-1B Visa Restrictions:** Stricter U.S. immigration policies could harm India's IT industry, limiting skilled labor migration.  
   - **Technology Access:** Protectionist policies might restrict technology transfer and innovation partnerships.  

4. **Climate Action and Energy:**  
   - Slower global climate action could hinder India’s transition to renewable energy due to reduced global support and investment.  

5. **Opportunities:**  
   - **Strategic Autonomy:** India may leverage weakened multilateral frameworks to assert regional leadership.  
   - **Trade Diversification:** India could explore new markets and regional trade agreements to mitigate the impact of U.S. protectionism.  

---

### **Conclusion**

Trump’s "America First" policy could disrupt globalization, weaken global institutions, and escalate geopolitical tensions. For India, this means navigating economic challenges, geopolitical shifts, and reduced multilateral cooperation. However, it also presents opportunities for India to enhance strategic autonomy, diversify trade partnerships, and assert regional leadership in a fragmented global order.

> What is Mr. Trump’s approach to the “rules-based international order”? We know from his first Presidency, that he expounds an “America First” doctrine. He debunks multilateralism in global politics, and he trashes international agreements that he believes do not favour the United States. He prefers bilateral agreements over multilateral ones: witness his approach to the Paris Climate Agreement (from which he withdrew and is likely to withdraw again) and to trade agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. He is dismissive of international institutions like the United Nations and regional bodies such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, saying that these disproportionately benefit other nations at the expense of the U.S. To the delight of his acolytes, he places American sovereignty over global governance.
In the Trumpian worldview, strategy revolves around the bully pulpit, strong personal branding, a willingness to take risks, unconventional deal-making, winner-take-all in place of win-win. Practical outcomes rather than theoretical constructs are emphasised.
Donald Trump’s transactionalism is legend. His MAGA (“Make America Great Again”) policy will have implications influencing global geopolitics. This will entail a rise of protectionism in global trade (free trade is an anachronism in this scheme of things), escalating tariffs and trade wars and increased economic uncertainty. Intensified competition with China where Beijing is clearly framed as an economic and ideological adversary will affect global stability, particularly in the Indo-Pacific.

# Transforming ‘men’-talities, redefining masculinity

As another **International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women passes by (November 25)**, we face a stark truth: despite decades of advocacy, nearly **one in three women** worldwide has endured violence at the hands of men. While men are often the perpetrators, they can also be key agents of change. Addressing violence against women requires addressing men’s roles and questioning traditional notions of masculinities based on strength, aggression and control. These notions need to be replaced by a culture where equality, empathy, and non-violence define alternative notions of manhood.

Violence against women can be seen, somewhat paradoxically, as a quintessential **“men’s issue”** — a societal issue that demands the active engagement of men. From early childhood, boys are influenced by norms that tell them **strength is dominance, that emotions are a weakness**, and that asserting control is the way to protect their status. These deeply entrenched ideas not only harm women but also limit men’s lives and their relationships, trapping them in cycles of suppressed emotions and aggressive behaviours. Recognising and reshaping these norms is essential for creating healthier relationships and a safer world.

The subject of men and masculinities has become a prominent focus within the development sector. Over the past two decades, academic research and grass-root efforts have revealed the importance of engaging with men, highlighted strategies that work, and shown how men are increasingly stepping out to challenge traditional gender norms. This growing shift reflects a recognition among men of their role in advancing gender equality.

### An India report

UNESCO’s Transforming **MENtalities** initiative has aimed to shift the way men engage with gender issues — not just as allies but as active participants in social transformation. This initiative challenges rigid and stereotyped ideas of masculinity and fosters positive, supportive roles for men, engaging them as champions for gender equality. As we inch closer to Agenda 2030 — working to create an inclusive and equal world — UNESCO, in collaboration with the International Center for Research on Women (ICRW), is proud to present the report, **“Engaging Men and Boys: A Report on Pathways to Gender Equality in India”**. This report documents 10 pioneering programmes across India that engage men and boys to address gender inequality.

### Some of the interventions

Through impactful initiatives, these programmes encourage critical dialogues that are aimed at questioning traditional gender norms, reshaping concepts of masculinity, and fostering inclusive attitudes. **By emphasising education, open discussions, and community-driven actions**, these programmes empower participants to become advocates for gender equity within their household and within communities and institutions they are part of.

For example, **‘Mardon Wali Baat (A man’s thing’), an initiative by The YP Foundation**, uses storytelling and social media to foster conversations around positive masculinities with young men on campuses and in communities. This intervention helps young men critically examine the limiting narratives they have grown up with, empowering them to embrace values of respect and equality. Similarly, **Gender Equity Movement in Schools (GEMS)**, a collaboration between the ICRW and the Department of Education in the State of Rajasthan, uses interactive classroom activities to help adolescent boys see the harm in toxic masculinity and adopt more equitable gender attitudes. In one session, a boy reflected, **“I used to think boys should only do outdoor chores. Now, I believe we should work alongside women at home.”** These moments of transformation create ripple effects that can reshape entire communities.

Initiatives such as **‘Dekh Rekh (caring for each other’) and ‘Hamari Shaadi (our marriage’)** encourage men’s active participation in family nutrition and planning, tackling gender bias through small, everyday actions. These interventions prove that when men and boys are invited to engage with gender equality as a part of their lives, rather than as an abstract idea, change becomes possible.

### The defining role of public figures

Change also becomes possible when men and boys have positive role models demonstrating equitable behaviours. These initiatives underscore the importance of role models who actively participate in household and care-giving responsibilities, **reject violence as a solution, practise empathy, and embrace vulnerability**. Public figures, in particular, can help normalise gender equality. For instance, **a well-known Indian cricketer recently sparked a national conversation on shared parenting and responsibility by publicly committing to paternity leave**. Actions such as these highlight how equitable relationships are rooted in care, respect, and partnership, redefining what it means to “be a man” in ways that uplift both individuals and communities.

The path to true equality is long, and the active participation of men is crucial in this journey. Beyond rejecting violence, men can challenge the stereotypes and cultural norms that perpetuate it. They must see themselves as essential contributors to change, helping dismantle toxic ideas of manhood. This requires a willingness to question the privileges that patriarchy grants the world and to explore ways to address the pressures and expectations that accompany these privileges. By reflecting on and reshaping their roles, men can play a transformative part in building a more equitable society for all.

In the new year, let us celebrate those men and boys who are **“Transforming MEN’talities”** and championing equality. Together, by redefining masculinity, we can create a world where every individual, regardless of gender, is free from violence and empowered to thrive.

### **Transforming ‘Men’-talities: Redefining Masculinity**

Traditional notions of masculinity have long been associated with traits like strength, dominance, emotional restraint, and competitiveness. These outdated stereotypes have often placed immense pressure on men to conform to rigid gender roles, suppress emotions, and avoid behaviors deemed "unmanly." However, in recent years, societal shifts and growing awareness have sparked important conversations around transforming mindsets—**‘men’-talities**—and redefining what it means to be masculine.

---

### **Challenging Traditional Masculinity**

1. **Emotional Expression:**  
   - Men are increasingly encouraged to express vulnerability and emotions, breaking free from the belief that emotional restraint is a sign of strength.  
   - Open discussions about **mental health** have helped dismantle the stigma around men seeking emotional support and therapy.  

2. **Rejecting Toxic Masculinity:**  
   - Toxic masculinity promotes aggression, misogyny, and emotional suppression. Redefining masculinity involves rejecting these harmful traits.  
   - Men are now being encouraged to be **empathetic**, **compassionate**, and **inclusive**.  

3. **Shared Responsibilities:**  
   - The traditional role of men as sole providers is evolving. There’s a growing acceptance of men actively participating in **domestic duties** and **childcare**, promoting gender equality in households.  

4. **Redefining Strength:**  
   - Strength is no longer limited to physical dominance but includes **emotional resilience**, **kindness**, and **integrity**.  
   - Men are celebrated for advocating for social causes, showing empathy, and practicing emotional intelligence.  

---

### **Factors Driving Change**

1. **Education and Awareness:**  
   - Gender studies and advocacy campaigns challenge stereotypes and promote equality.  
   - Media representation of diverse male identities helps reshape societal perceptions.  

2. **Feminist Movements:**  
   - Feminism has played a role in questioning gender roles, encouraging men to reflect on their own social conditioning.  

3. **Mental Health Advocacy:**  
   - Global movements promoting mental well-being encourage men to seek help and dismantle the "men don’t cry" mindset.  

4. **Legal and Workplace Reforms:**  
   - **Paternity leave policies**, flexible work arrangements, and anti-harassment laws support men in embracing nurturing roles.  

---

### **Redefining Masculinity in Practice**

1. **Positive Role Models:**  
   - Public figures, athletes, and influencers embracing vulnerability and emotional honesty inspire young men.  
   - Celebrities like **Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson** and **Virat Kohli** openly discuss mental health and family involvement.  

2. **Inclusive Education:**  
   - Schools and educational programs teaching emotional literacy and gender sensitivity foster balanced mindsets.  

3. **Men as Allies:**  
   - Men are increasingly standing up against gender-based violence and supporting gender equality initiatives.  

---

### **Conclusion**

Redefining masculinity is about embracing a **balanced**, **inclusive**, and **emotionally aware** identity that allows men to live authentically. By challenging outdated stereotypes, promoting emotional well-being, and fostering equality, societies can transform ‘men’-talities for healthier, more compassionate, and progressive communities. This transformation benefits not just men but society as a whole, paving the way for a more equitable and understanding world.

> Redefining masculinity involves challenging traditional stereotypes of men as dominant, emotionally restrained, and solely responsible providers. Modern masculinity encourages emotional expression, empathy, and shared responsibilities in domestic and caregiving roles. Movements for gender equality, mental health awareness, and inclusive education drive this shift, helping men reject toxic masculinity and embrace emotional resilience and compassion. Positive role models and workplace reforms, like paternity leave, support this change. Transforming ‘men’-talities fosters healthier, more balanced identities, promoting gender equality and creating a more compassionate and inclusive society that benefits everyone.

# The way forward for PM-KISAN

### **Comprehensive Analysis of PM-KISAN and the Way Forward**

**Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN)**, launched in February 2019, is a flagship government scheme aimed at providing direct income support to small and marginal farmers in India. Under this scheme, eligible farmers receive **₹6,000 annually** in three equal installments of **₹2,000** each, directly transferred to their bank accounts. The objective is to ensure financial stability for farmers and assist them in meeting agricultural and household expenses.

---

### **Achievements of PM-KISAN**

1. **Income Support to Farmers:**  
   - Direct cash transfers provide immediate relief for purchasing seeds, fertilizers, and meeting household needs.  
   - It has covered over **11 crore** farmers across the country, reducing their financial dependence on informal credit.  

2. **Financial Inclusion:**  
   - The scheme promotes financial inclusion by linking farmers to the banking system through **Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT)**.  
   - Encourages digital banking, improving transparency and reducing corruption.  

3. **Rural Consumption Boost:**  
   - The regular cash flow has contributed to increased rural demand, benefiting local economies.  

4. **Targeting Small and Marginal Farmers:**  
   - Initially focused on small farmers (with landholding up to 2 hectares), the scheme was later expanded to cover all landholding farmers, ensuring wider support.  

---

### **Challenges in Implementation**

1. **Identification and Exclusion Errors:**  
   - Inaccurate land records have led to the exclusion of deserving farmers and inclusion of ineligible beneficiaries.  
   - Tenant farmers and sharecroppers, who don’t own land, are excluded despite being vulnerable.  

2. **Insufficient Financial Support:**  
   - The **₹6,000** annual support is inadequate given the rising costs of agricultural inputs and market uncertainties.  

3. **Dependence on State Cooperation:**  
   - Inconsistent cooperation from states in verifying land records and beneficiary data affects smooth implementation.  

4. **Technological and Infrastructure Gaps:**  
   - Digital illiteracy and lack of access to banking facilities in remote areas hinder timely disbursement.  

5. **Overlapping with Other Schemes:**  
   - Lack of integration with state-level agricultural schemes results in duplication and inefficiencies.  

---

### **The Way Forward for PM-KISAN**

1. **Improving Targeting and Inclusion:**  
   - **Digitize Land Records:** Accelerate the digitization and updating of land records for accurate beneficiary identification.  
   - **Include Tenant Farmers:** Extend benefits to tenant farmers, sharecroppers, and landless agricultural laborers through innovative verification methods.  

2. **Enhancing Financial Support:**  
   - Increase the financial assistance in alignment with inflation and rising agricultural costs.  
   - Introduce **region-specific support** considering climatic risks and crop patterns.  

3. **Integration with Other Schemes:**  
   - Link PM-KISAN with schemes like **PM Fasal Bima Yojana (crop insurance)**, **Soil Health Card**, and **Kisan Credit Card** for comprehensive agricultural support.  
   - Encourage convergence with state welfare schemes for better resource utilization.  

4. **Capacity Building and Awareness:**  
   - Conduct awareness campaigns to educate farmers about scheme benefits, eligibility, and grievance redressal mechanisms.  
   - Provide training for digital banking access in rural areas.  

5. **Technology-Driven Monitoring:**  
   - Use **Aadhaar-based verification**, **satellite mapping**, and **GIS technology** to prevent fraud and ensure accurate targeting.  
   - Implement **real-time monitoring systems** for fund disbursement transparency.  

6. **Climate Resilience and Sustainability:**  
   - Integrate climate-resilient farming practices and promote sustainable agriculture.  
   - Offer incentives for adopting water-efficient and eco-friendly farming methods.  

7. **Grievance Redressal Mechanism:**  
   - Establish accessible grievance redressal platforms for quick resolution of beneficiary complaints.  

---

### **Conclusion**

PM-KISAN has significantly contributed to supporting farmers by providing direct income support. However, addressing challenges like exclusion errors, inadequate financial aid, and implementation inefficiencies is crucial for maximizing its impact. A **holistic approach** that includes expanding coverage to tenant farmers, integrating with other welfare schemes, leveraging technology, and ensuring climate resilience can transform PM-KISAN into a comprehensive support system. Strengthening these aspects will empower Indian farmers, ensure sustainable agricultural growth, and contribute to the broader goal of **doubling farmers' income**.

> The **PM-KISAN** scheme provides ₹6,000 annually to farmers for financial support, benefiting over **11 crore** farmers and promoting financial inclusion. However, challenges like exclusion of tenant farmers, insufficient financial aid, and implementation gaps hinder its full impact. To improve effectiveness, the scheme should **digitize land records**, **include tenant farmers**, **increase financial support**, and **integrate with other agricultural schemes**. Leveraging technology for monitoring, enhancing farmer awareness, and promoting climate-resilient practices can make PM-KISAN more comprehensive. Strengthening these areas will empower farmers, boost agricultural growth, and contribute to the goal of **doubling farmers' income**.

# Maha Kumbh begins; 15 million pilgrims gather for Shahi Snan

### **Maha Kumbh Mela: A Sacred Confluence of Faith and Tradition**

The **Maha Kumbh Mela** is one of the largest and most significant religious gatherings in the world, deeply rooted in Hindu tradition. Held every **12 years**, it rotates among four sacred locations in India: **Prayagraj (Uttar Pradesh)**, **Haridwar (Uttarakhand)**, **Ujjain (Madhya Pradesh)**, and **Nashik (Maharashtra)**. The Maha Kumbh, distinct from the annual and Ardh Kumbh (held every six years), holds immense spiritual importance due to its scale and the celestial alignments that guide its timing.

---

### **Mythological Significance**

The origins of the Kumbh Mela trace back to the ancient Hindu legend of the **Samudra Manthan** (churning of the ocean). According to mythology, gods (**Devas**) and demons (**Asuras**) churned the ocean to obtain the nectar of immortality (**Amrit**). During the battle for Amrit, a few drops spilled at four places—**Prayagraj**, **Haridwar**, **Ujjain**, and **Nashik**—making these sites spiritually potent. The Maha Kumbh celebrates this divine event, symbolizing the eternal struggle between good and evil and the victory of virtue.

---

### **Rituals and Practices**

The highlight of the Maha Kumbh Mela is the **Shahi Snan (Royal Bath)**, where millions of pilgrims, ascetics, and sadhus take a holy dip in sacred rivers, believing it purifies sins and leads to **moksha** (liberation). The rivers associated with each site—**Ganga** at Haridwar, **Sangam** (confluence of Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati) at Prayagraj, **Shipra** at Ujjain, and **Godavari** at Nashik—are considered carriers of divine blessings.

The event is marked by the processions of various **Akharas** (monastic orders), especially the **Naga Sadhus**, who lead the Shahi Snan with grandeur. Other rituals include **yajnas** (fire rituals), **pravachans** (spiritual discourses), and **bhajans** (devotional songs).

---

### **Cultural and Social Significance**

1. **Unity in Diversity:**  
   The Kumbh Mela transcends caste, creed, and regional boundaries, uniting millions in a shared spiritual experience. Pilgrims from across India and the world gather, showcasing India's cultural richness and diversity.  

2. **Preservation of Traditions:**  
   The Mela preserves ancient Hindu practices, philosophies, and rituals, serving as a platform for the exchange of spiritual knowledge between saints, scholars, and devotees.  

3. **Global Recognition:**  
   In 2017, the **Kumbh Mela** was inscribed in the **UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity**, acknowledging its cultural and spiritual significance on a global scale.  

4. **Economic Impact:**  
   The Mela boosts local economies through tourism, trade, and services. Vendors, artisans, and local businesses benefit from the massive influx of visitors.  

---

### **Modern Challenges and Management**

Managing a gathering of millions presents challenges in crowd control, sanitation, health, and security. However, with advancements in technology and infrastructure, the Indian government has implemented:  
- **Smart surveillance systems** for safety.  
- **Eco-friendly initiatives** to manage waste and protect rivers.  
- **Digital platforms** for pilgrim information and event management.  

---

### **Spiritual Significance in Modern Times**

In today’s fast-paced world, the Maha Kumbh serves as a spiritual retreat, offering a moment of reflection and renewal. It reinforces values of **faith**, **community**, and **resilience**, reminding people of the importance of inner peace and the connection between humanity and nature.

# Indians abroad

At the inauguration of the **18th edition of the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas (PBD)** last week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi described the Indian diaspora as India’s **“ambassadors to the world”**, having **“seamlessly assimilated”** into the local society, served the community, and contributed to India’s growth and prosperity. The strength of the India-origin community worldwide of over **35 million — about 15.85 million NRIs** and **19.57 million PIOs**, who are foreign nationals — is their ability to adapt and thrive in different fields, including in politics, where Indian-origin people have become leaders of more than 30 other countries. Where they retain their Indian passports, the diaspora is known for its distinguished services in many professional spheres. The PBD’s purpose is to celebrate this success and discuss issues of importance; President Droupadi Murmu handed out about **27 Pravasi Bharatiya Samman awards**. The event, which was first held in **2003**, is organised around **January 9, when Mahatma Gandhi returned to India from South Africa in 1915**. The latest event, held in Bhubaneswar, Odisha, brought more than 3,000 delegates from across 70 countries, with much of the focus on how the diaspora can help in developing India **(Viksit Bharat programme)**.

The achievements of the Indian diaspora are, no doubt, a matter of pride for all Indians, but it is important that the event is not limited to a simple self-congratulatory or laudatory exercise. The issues for the diaspora, particularly for those who are still Indian nationals, are more acute now. The increase in far-right populist governments, particularly in the West, is making visa and entry conditions for Indians more difficult, and it is important for the government to address such issues. Intractable global conflicts, especially in West Asia where more than nine million Indians live and work, are also putting lakhs of Indians in peril, and the PBD engagement would benefit from discussions between the community on how best to increase awareness and enhance safeguards for them. Given the broad spread of the diaspora, it is necessary to ensure that India’s ties with its diaspora be inclusive, and non-partisan on political issues. Recent actions by the government to deny or revoke OCI cards for those perceived to be critical of the government bely this necessity. Above all, it is important to acknowledge that one of the biggest drivers of Indians migrating is the lack of economic opportunities within India. While there are no easy fixes for this, the loss to India of some of its most talented people must be counted, even as the country celebrates their incredible success and impact on the global stage.

### **Indians Abroad: A Global Presence**

Indians living abroad, known as the Indian diaspora, form one of the largest and most influential migrant communities globally. With over **32 million** people of Indian origin (PIOs) and Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) spread across more than 200 countries, the Indian diaspora significantly contributes to both their host countries and India.

---

### **Historical Migration**

Indian migration began during the colonial era when the British transported Indians as indentured laborers to plantations in the Caribbean, Africa, Fiji, and Southeast Asia. Post-independence, waves of skilled professionals, entrepreneurs, and students migrated to Western countries like the **United States**, **United Kingdom**, **Canada**, and **Australia**, driven by better educational and employment opportunities.

---

### **Economic Contributions**

1. **Remittances:**  
   - India has consistently been the **top recipient of remittances**, with NRIs sending billions of dollars annually.  
   - These funds support families and contribute to India's economy, aiding in rural development and social welfare.

2. **Business and Entrepreneurship:**  
   - Indian entrepreneurs have established successful businesses worldwide, especially in technology, healthcare, and hospitality.  
   - Notable Indian-origin CEOs include **Sundar Pichai** (Google) and **Satya Nadella** (Microsoft).

3. **Skilled Workforce:**  
   - Indian professionals dominate global sectors like **IT**, **medicine**, **engineering**, and **finance**.  
   - Countries like the U.S. and Canada have benefited from India's highly skilled workforce.

---

### **Cultural Influence**

1. **Soft Power:**  
   - Indian culture, including **Bollywood**, **yoga**, **Ayurveda**, and **Indian cuisine**, has gained global popularity.  
   - Festivals like **Diwali** and **Holi** are celebrated worldwide, promoting multicultural harmony.

2. **Community Organizations:**  
   - Indian diaspora communities actively participate in local cultural events, charity, and social welfare programs, strengthening India’s global image.

---

### **Challenges Faced**

1. **Racism and Discrimination:**  
   - Indians abroad sometimes face racial discrimination and cultural biases.  
   - Hate crimes against minorities have been reported in some Western countries.

2. **Legal and Immigration Issues:**  
   - Visa restrictions and immigration policies in countries like the U.S. have affected Indian professionals, especially in tech sectors.

3. **Identity Struggles:**  
   - Balancing cultural identity and assimilation can be challenging for second-generation Indians.

---

### **India’s Engagement with the Diaspora**

The Indian government actively engages with the diaspora through:  
- **Pravasi Bharatiya Divas (PBD):** Celebrates the contributions of overseas Indians.  
- **Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI):** Offers lifelong visa-free entry and certain economic rights.  
- **Economic Diplomacy:** Attracting investments and fostering innovation partnerships.

---

### **Conclusion**

Indians abroad are a vital bridge between India and the global community. Their economic contributions, cultural influence, and diplomatic roles enhance India's global standing while enriching their host countries through diversity and innovation.

> The Indian diaspora, with over **32 million** people worldwide, significantly contributes to global economies and India’s development. Historically migrating as laborers during colonial times, modern Indian migrants include skilled professionals, entrepreneurs, and students in countries like the **U.S.**, **UK**, and **Canada**. They bolster India's economy through substantial **remittances**, business ventures, and cultural influence via **Bollywood**, **yoga**, and festivals. However, challenges like **discrimination**, **visa restrictions**, and identity struggles persist. The Indian government engages the diaspora through initiatives like **Pravasi Bharatiya Divas** and **OCI cards**, strengthening global connections and fostering India’s growth and international presence.
