# India needs to prioritise preventive care

India is facing a healthcare crisis that is growing both in scope and cost. We face an alarming dichotomy today: while life expectancy of Indians is expected to increase further, many are facing disease burden earlier. As the country sees an alarming rise in non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and cancer, the financial burden on individuals and the healthcare system continues to escalate.

NCDs accounted for about 65% of all deaths in 2022, up from about 50% in 2010-13, as per the National Family Health Survey-5. The prevalence of risk factors for NCDs is worryingly high. One in four adult men are hypertensive. One in eight are diabetic. Further, breast, lung, and cervical cancer are on the rise, with the median age of diagnosis occurring earlier than global averages.

Millions of people who are facing these conditions could have been managed better, at often lower costs, had they been diagnosed earlier. In this context, shifting the focus from reactive treatment to proactive prevention is crucial, not only to improve health outcomes but also to control the ever-increasing healthcare expenses.

### A growing economic burden

The Union Budget for 2024 allocated ₹87,657 crore to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, marking a 13% increase from the previous year. While this is a step forward, experts agree that this allocation remains insufficient given the scale of India’s health challenges.

The National Health Accounts show the total current health expenditure estimate in 2021-22 as ₹7.9 lakh crore, growing at a rate more than overall inflation. The share of household health expenditure, including insurance contributions, while decreasing over time, still drives nearly 50%+ of the spend. This remains one of the highest globally.

The World Health Organization (WHO) projects that the economic burden of NCDs in India will surpass ₹280 lakh crore by 2030 — a cost equivalent to ₹2 lakh per household. This escalating cost, driven by rising healthcare expenses and productivity losses, poses a severe threat to financial stability, particularly for middle and lower-income families.

Regular screenings, especially for high-risk individuals, could significantly reduce the incidence of serious, life-threatening and debilitating conditions and its resultant cascading economic and social effects. In a large hospital network, for every 1,000 people screened, at least three people are identified for pre-emptive cardiac or cancer interventions.

Targeted but periodic screening investigations for individuals such as mammograms for breast cancer, pap smears for cervical cancer, X-ray or low-dose computed tomography for lung cancer, ultrasound for liver disease, echo cardiography and treadmill stress test for heart disease beyond the physical vitals and blood tests enable early intervention.

Unfortunately, comprehensive health checks (which can cost anywhere between ₹8,000 and ₹15,000 in metro cities today) are perceived as expensive. If the government were to enable a step change in preventive health services adoption, it could significantly reduce the overall financial burden on individuals and the healthcare system.

Tax incentives, subsidised screenings, and public awareness are key policy tools that can enable this. As part of the Finance Act, 2013, the Union government made efforts to encourage preventive healthcare by offering a ₹5,000 tax deduction under Section 80D of the Income Tax Act for health checks. However, this amount has remained stagnant for the last decade, despite the 12-14% estimated healthcare inflation rate and the rising cost of healthcare services. Thus, it would be prudent for our policymakers to consider revising the tax deduction limit to at least ₹15,000 in the Union Budget for 2025-26. This would incentivise more individuals to undergo preventive health checks, potentially saving the nation several thousand of crores ifn uture healthcare costs. The incremental tax foregone to the exchequer from such a measure is estimated to be less than ₹5,000 crore, a worthy investment towards improving the health of the nation.

### The path forward

We need to prioritise preventive care to mitigate the increasing economic and financial burden of chronic diseases. A three-pronged approach can potentially drive a change in the adoption of preventive health services.

First, we need to strengthen early intervention capabilities through the Ayushman Health and Wellness Centres, including capturing trends effectively and enabling risk-driven targeted screening using AI-enabled imaging modalities to offer lower cost screenings at-scale.

Second, we need to improve the adoption of screening at private centres by encouraging insurers and private health providers to offer a subsidised minimum screening programme for every individual between 40-60 years. For example, for women after the age of 40, a mammogram is necessary annually or once in two years, based on her risk factors. Exploring part funding through allocations from proceeds from the healthcare cess or the proposed 35% GST slab on tobacco and sugar products can help reduce funding needs.

Finally, the increase in tax deduction limit can further incentivise people to complete comprehensive health checks.

By prioritising preventive care over reactive treatments, India can pave the way for a healthier and more economically resilient future.

> India must prioritize **preventive healthcare** to address the growing burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), rising healthcare costs, and overburdened medical infrastructure. Preventive care focuses on early detection, vaccination, lifestyle changes, and awareness to reduce the incidence of diseases like diabetes, hypertension, and cancer. By investing in health education, regular screenings, and accessible healthcare services, India can reduce treatment costs, improve public health outcomes, and enhance productivity. Strengthening policies and infrastructure for preventive care will also reduce pressure on hospitals, ensuring better resource allocation. A proactive approach to healthcare can create a healthier, more resilient population and sustainable healthcare system.

# Empower the guardians of the earth, do not rob them

The ₹72,000-crore mega infrastructure project on Great Nicobar will now also have an international cruise terminal and a shipbreaking yard, as proposed by the Union Shipping Ministry. In this article, dated April 22, 2024, Ajay Saini and Manish Chandi talk about the rights of the indigenous communities over the little islands of the Andaman and Nicobar archipelago and how they have been able to protect and preserve the area’s ecological balance.

In the southern expanse of the Andaman and Nicobar archipelago, off the shores of Little Nicobar, lie seven tiny islands. Classified as “uninhabited” in the government’s records, these islets are nonetheless integral to the indigenous communities of the region. Two, officially called Meroë and Menchal, are known as Piruii and Pingaeyak, respectively, to the Payuh, the indigenous southern Nicobarese peoples, who hold traditional rights over these and other islets.

For millennia, these historically isolated indigenes have relied on these islands as resource reservoirs for sustenance and protected them. Menchal is revered, used, and protected under the spiritual realm called Pingaeyak (a spirit that is believed to reside on the island), prohibiting the overexploitation of resources or any undue harm to its ecosystem. Similarly, Meroë is believed to be the abode of a legendary islander community. Here, too, spiritual belief systems influence how the islanders use and protect natural resources.

Meroë and Menchal are managed by community elders as guardians and specific individual caretakers. They ensure the protection of the island’s resources and sustainability. In today’s world, this phenomenon goes by the name of “conservation” and “sustainable use”, among other terms and phrases.

### Conservation colonialism

In May 2022, in complete disregard of the indigenous land ownership and management systems, the Andaman and Nicobar (A&N) administration issued three public notices, announcing its intention to create three wildlife sanctuaries: a coral sanctuary at Meroë Island, a megapode sanctuary at Menchal Island, and a leatherback turtle sanctuary on Little Nicobar Island.

In mid-July, the A&N administration issued an order asserting that it did not receive any claims or objections from any individual regarding the land and marine areas within the three proposed sanctuaries; that no individual enjoys any rights within the boundaries of the proposed sanctuaries. And, that there will be “restriction on the people of neighbouring area to enter into these islands… in the national interest.”

Approximately 1,200 southern Nicobarese inhabit Patai Takaru (Great Nicobar Island), and Patai t-bhi (Little Nicobar Island), holding traditional rights over both inhabited and ostensibly “uninhabited” islands. Yet, the A&N administration neither consulted nor informed the southern Nicobarese of its plans.

Despite verbal supplications and a letter in August 2022 from the Little & Great Nicobar Tribal Council that expressed the community’s concerns to the A&N administration and the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, the A&N administration proceeded to issue official notifications in October 2022, designating the whole of Meroë (2.73 square kilometres, including the surrounding marine area) and Menchal (1.29 sq. km), along with a 13.75 sq. km area (including 6.67 sq. km. of water area within the baseline system) on Little Nicobar (140 sq. km), as wildlife sanctuaries.

### Masking an ecological disaster

The selection of Meroë and Menchal Islands as conservation reserves for coral reefs and Megapode birds is arbitrary. Menchal does not have more than a pair or two of the endemic Megapode birds. Similarly, questions arise regarding the actual diversity and abundance of corals on Meroë Island.

Notably, the announcement of wildlife sanctuaries coincided with growing scrutiny and criticism from experts over the denotification of the Galathea Bay Wildlife Sanctuary for a ₹72,000-crore mega project on Great Nicobar, a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve.

Establishing exclusionary conservation areas in a region, which is already a paradise for biodiversity, stems from the fact that the champions of the mega project are aware of the extensive environmental and social damage that the project will entail. It will devastate about eight to 10 lakh evergreen forest trees, smother and gouge out scores of coral reefs found along Galathea Bay, destroy the nesting site for the globally endangered Leatherback sea turtle species, devastate hundreds of nesting mounds of Nicobar Megapodes, and kill as many crocodiles.

Furthermore, it will prevent the indigenous Great Nicobar islanders from returning to their pre-tsunami homeland where they husbanded pigs and chicken, cultivated coconut and betel nut trees, and lived simple and gregarious lives. Most importantly, it will uproot three or more settlements of the Shompen (a ‘Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group’) and permanently destroy their foraging and hunting grounds.

The unilateral decision to establish wildlife sanctuaries disregards the islands’ profound significance to the indigenous population.

Their ancestral lands are unjustly perceived as “no-man’s-land” to appease conservationists, investors, public opinion, and more.

### Support earth’s guardians

Globally, governments blatantly violate indigenous people’s rights by evicting them from their ancestral lands, often under the guise of development, national interest, conservation projects, among others. Approximately 476 million indigenous peoples, constitute about 6% of the global population. Indigenous territories cover roughly 22% of the planet’s land surface and harbour 80% of its biodiversity.

Indigenous peoples are the original guardians of our earth. The world must learn from their wisdom. Reason and justice dictate that in southern Nicobar, we should support and empower the islanders to continue to steward their ancestral territories, rather than robbing them of their lands, resources, lifeways, and worldviews.

### **Empower the Guardians of the Earth: The Role of Tribals in Conservation**

The phrase **“Empower the guardians of the earth, do not rob them”** resonates deeply with the plight and potential of tribal communities worldwide. Tribals, often referred to as **indigenous peoples**, are the traditional custodians of forests, rivers, and ecosystems. Their **lifestyles**, **knowledge systems**, and **spiritual connections with nature** have preserved biodiversity for centuries. However, they are frequently marginalized, displaced, or exploited in the name of development, resource extraction, or conservation.

---

### **The Role of Tribals as Guardians of the Earth**
1. **Traditional Knowledge:**
   - Tribals possess centuries-old knowledge of **sustainable agriculture**, **forest management**, and **biodiversity conservation**.
   - Practices like **shifting cultivation**, herbal medicine, and resource-sharing are examples of their harmonious coexistence with nature.

2. **Cultural and Spiritual Bonds:**
   - Tribal communities view nature as sacred, fostering deep respect for ecosystems.
   - Rituals, songs, and oral traditions emphasize sustainable living and environmental stewardship.

3. **Key Ecosystems Under Tribal Custodianship:**
   - Tribals inhabit **forest-rich regions** like the Amazon, African savannahs, and Indian forests such as **Dandakaranya**, **Chhota Nagpur Plateau**, and the **Northeast**.

---

### **Challenges Faced by Tribals**
1. **Displacement in the Name of Development:**
   - Infrastructure projects like **dams**, **mining**, and **industrial zones** often displace tribal populations without adequate rehabilitation.
   - Loss of ancestral lands disrupts their way of life and cultural identity.

2. **Exclusion from Decision-Making:**
   - Tribals are rarely consulted in decisions affecting their territories, even though their input could ensure sustainable solutions.
   - **Forest laws** and restrictions on their activities often criminalize traditional practices.

3. **Economic Exploitation:**
   - Resource extraction projects exploit tribal lands, offering little economic benefit to the community.
   - Traditional livelihoods are undermined, forcing tribals into low-wage labor or migration.

4. **Cultural Erosion:**
   - Forced assimilation and loss of land erode tribal cultural identities and traditional knowledge.

---

### **Empowering Tribals: Key Steps**
1. **Recognize and Protect Land Rights:**
   - Implement laws like India’s **Forest Rights Act (2006)** effectively, granting tribals ownership of their ancestral lands.

2. **Inclusion in Governance:**
   - Empower tribals in decision-making processes, ensuring their voices shape policies on land use and conservation.

3. **Livelihood Support:**
   - Promote sustainable tribal livelihoods through initiatives like **forest-based industries**, eco-tourism, and support for traditional crafts.

4. **Education and Healthcare:**
   - Ensure access to culturally sensitive education and healthcare without disrupting tribal traditions.

5. **Strengthen Tribal Institutions:**
   - Support **Gram Sabhas** and tribal councils to govern resources and preserve their cultural heritage.

---

### **Conclusion**
Tribals are the **true guardians of the earth**, protecting ecosystems through sustainable living. Marginalizing or displacing them harms both their communities and the environment. Empowering them with land rights, livelihood opportunities, and representation in governance ensures their role as stewards of nature while preserving their cultural heritage. Protecting tribals is not just an act of justice but also a step toward sustainable development and environmental conservation.

> Tribals are the **guardians of the earth**, preserving ecosystems through their sustainable practices and deep cultural connections with nature. Despite their vital role, they face displacement, exclusion from decision-making, economic exploitation, and cultural erosion due to development projects and restrictive policies. Empowering tribals requires recognizing their **land rights**, including them in governance, promoting sustainable livelihoods, and providing culturally sensitive education and healthcare. Effective implementation of laws like the **Forest Rights Act (2006)** is essential. Protecting tribals not only ensures justice for their communities but also supports global efforts in **sustainable development** and **environmental conservation**, safeguarding biodiversity for future generations.

# Implications of China’s mega-dam project

The ambitious plan to build a mega-hydropower dam across the Brahmaputra at the Great Bend region of the Medog county in the Tibetan Autonomous Region (TAR) in China, has been in the drawing boards of Chinese hydrocracy for decades. The clearest signalling to this effect happened in 2020 when this project was included in China’s 14th Five-Year Plan. Its approval was granted on December 25, 2024. India, Bhutan and Bangladesh will have serious downstream implications of this 60 GW hyper-dam built upstream by China.

### Where is this project?

The Brahmaputra is a transboundary Himalayan river basin spanning four riparian countries. China is the uppermost riparian nation with the river system originating in the TAR, where it is known as the Yarlung Zangbo (or Tsangpo). India and Bhutan are lower riparian nations in relation to China and middle riparian countries in relation to Bangladesh. It is from Bangladesh, which is the lowermost riparian nation, that the river drains into the Bay of Bengal. All riparian countries have major water infrastructure projects planned in the river basin, such as hydropower dams, embankments meant for river control, irrigation dams and barrages.

### Is the Brahmaputra river basin trapped within nation-states?

Transboundary river systems are often likened by nation-states to ‘taps’, which they think can be closed or opened through hydraulic interventions such as dams within their respective nation-states. The Brahmaputra river system has been the site of planned and ongoing mega-dams projects by China, India and Bhutan, all contributing to an intense geopolitical power projection in the river basin. Mega-dams on rivers systems are seen as important sovereignty markers; symbols of nation-state control over natural features. Highly dramatised terms such as ‘water wars’ are part of the geopolitical vocabulary and upstream hydropower dams are viewed as ‘water bombs’ by lower riparian nations, as in the case of the Medog dam project. China sits pretty at the top of Asia’s water tower, with complete control over Tibet’s rivers and significant material, technological and discursive capabilities to deploy unilateral hydropower development.

The Chinese hydrocracy has gone forward with mega-hydropower developments such as the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze river and the Zangmu Dam on the Yarlung Zangbo, commissioned in 2015, with its top political leadership firmly backing these interventions as state symbols.

### What are the risks for communities inhabiting the Brahmaputra river basin?

The communities living along the river system have adapted as the river has shaped and shifted over centuries. However, with interventions such as mega-hydropower dams by China, India and Bhutan, communities cannot use their traditional knowledge about the river system meaningfully, as the pace and occurrence of disasters have magnified. The upstream communities in Tibet as well as the downstream communities in India, Bhutan and Bangladesh have to live under the shadow of mega-hydropower dams with adverse consequences to their traditional lands and livelihood. The perennial flow of the Brahmaputra in downstream areas in India and Bangladesh depends on the flow of the Yarlung Zangbo. The blocking of that perennial flow, in order to maintain headwaters to operate a mega-hydropower dam of the magnitude that China is planning at the Great Bend, will have catastrophic consequences on surface water levels, and to overall monsoon patterns and groundwater systems of the river basin. This will affect downstream agrarian communities and the sensitive ecology of the overall Himalayan bioregion/ecoregion.

### What explains the hydropower dam-building race in the Brahmaputra river basin?

There is a face-off between China and India on the Yarlung Zangbo-Brahmaputra river course. China has announced the biggest hydropower project at the Great Bend while India has announced its largest dam project, at Upper Siang. Bhutan has been planning and building several medium to small dams, which have raised concerns in downstream India and Bangladesh. None of the riparian countries of the Brahmaputra river basin have signed the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Non-navigational Uses of International Watercourses of 2014, and hence first user-rights on river systems are non-enforceable. China and India have an Expert Level Mechanism (ELM) since 2006, to discuss outstanding issues and share hydrological data, but do not have a comprehensive bilateral treaty to govern shared transboundary rivers. The outstanding land boundary dispute between China and India is weaved into the intense securitisation of the Brahmaputra river basin, which makes it an active site for strategic posturing by both countries.

A bioregional/ecoregional frame of protecting the Himalayas may help desecuritise Brahmaputra river basin.

### What next?

A recent academic book by some Australian researchers titled Rivers of the Asian Highlands: from Deep Time to the Climate Crisis, puts forward important deep time (deep time means geological time; billions of years) perspectives to Himalayan river systems. The book juxtaposes a wider planetary thinking to emerge against the backdrop of narrow technocratic decision-making to build mega-dams within nation-states.

Tibet’s river systems are important to the Earth’s cryosphere, comprising permafrost and glaciers, and major climate systems directing climate and precipitation pathways such as the monsoon. Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) have increased in the Himalayas with climate change events, exemplified by the Chungthang Dam collapse in Sikkim during October 2023, which caused widespread devastation to life and property to downstream communities. The dams across the Himalayas aim at territorialising river systems, breaking their natural life cycles. This affects agro-pastoral communities, biodiversity, living biota in rivers and wetland systems. The Brahmaputra river basin will turn into an active risk-scape if all these planned dams are built eventually.

An accurate sense of history will help contextualise the site of the Medog dam being built by China. One of the greatest earthquakes of modern times, the 1950 Medog Earthquake, or the Assam-Tibet Earthquake, which transformed the riparian landscape, had its epicenter at Medog in Tibet. The earthquake had disastrous effects downstream in Assam and Bangladesh, with the landscape until now trapped in an unending cycle of annual catastrophic floods.

Philip Ball in his book titled Water Kingdom: A Secret History of China describes the Yarlung Zangbo being viewed in Chinese history as a ‘river gone rogue’ as it turns sharply from its west to east route at the Great Bend, to turn south to enter India, with other major rivers in China running from west to east. While China is going ahead with building mega-dams in Tibet to correct this geographical anomaly by disciplining a ‘rogue river’, India can assume an important riparian leadership role for regional river systems by not mirroring what China does. A dam for a dam will make the entire Himalayan riparian/climatic systems run dry and turn it into a disaster-scape for its communities.

> China’s mega-dam projects on transboundary rivers, particularly the **Brahmaputra (Yarlung Tsangpo)**, have significant implications for downstream countries like India and Bangladesh. These dams could alter water flow, affecting agriculture, drinking water, and ecosystems in downstream regions. The projects risk reducing water availability during dry seasons and increasing flood risks during monsoons. Geopolitically, they give China leverage over shared water resources, creating tensions with neighboring countries. Environmentally, large dams disrupt riverine ecosystems and displace communities. To mitigate these challenges, regional cooperation, water-sharing agreements, and robust diplomatic engagement are essential to ensure equitable and sustainable use of transboundary river resources.
