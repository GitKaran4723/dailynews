# River interlinking, the fount of environmental disaster

On December 25, 2024, Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for the Ken-Betwa River Link Project, which aims to solve the water scarcity in the Bundelkhand region that covers parts of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. The project also includes the construction of a dam located within the Panna Tiger Reserve, raising concerns about its submergence. Upon completion, this project will link the supposed water surplus Ken river with the Betwa in drought-stricken Bundelkhand — an area that had 58% forest cover in 1938.

### A misplaced model

This project, which costs around ₹45,000 crore, was launched despite the objections raised by experts, including members of an empowered committee appointed by the Supreme Court of India, and by circumventing the law that has strict terms for allowing hydroelectric power projects. Models of grandiose technological fixes as the solution to all water-related problems have gathered momentum. Politicians are now touting the concept of river interlinking for inter-basin water transfers as a geoengineering solution to continued water depletion in India.

The concept of inter-basin transfer was proposed 130 years ago by Sir Arthur Cotton, who designed irrigation dams in the Godavari and Krishna river valleys. M. Visvesvaraya, an early icon among Indian engineers, further refined this idea. K.L. Rao and Captain Dinshaw J. Dastur subsequently expanded the scope of this concept in 1970 and 1980. Initially termed the ‘National Water Grid’, this concept re-emerged as the ‘River-Interlinking Project’ (ILR) from the Ministry of Water Resources to transfer surplus waters from the Ganga and the Brahmaputra to water-deficient regions in central and southern India.

Following this, the National Water Development Agency (NWDA) was established in 1982 to conduct surveys and investigations, and to prepare feasibility reports for links under the National Perspective Plan. The NWDA identified 30 links for feasibility studies, divided into 14 Himalayan and 16 Peninsular river links. These links are anticipated to alleviate the impacts of floods and droughts, boost income in rural areas, and address water distress in agriculture.

The currently estimated cost of ₹5.5 lakh crore does not include the social, environmental and operational costs. Ultimately, all this will end up as taxes on the common man. This lofty idea of interlinking the rivers, to connect surplus rivers of the country with the deficient rivers is fundamentally flawed as it overlooks the huge environmental costs and the eventual deaths of the rivers and deltaic regions.

The uncontrolled human-induced disequilibrium in natural hydrographic systems will destroy associated ecological niches with incalculable repercussions for the long-term well-being of society — an unpardonable disservice to future generations. We may also have to factor in the consequences of climate change impacting rainfall and river flow, which will aggravate the situation. It is unclear how the nation’s declared commitment to mitigating human-induced climate change and river manipulation go hand in hand.

### The eco-services of rivers

Policymakers ignore the point that there is no “free” surplus water in any river and simple elementary arithmetic rationalisations such as tapping the ‘water lost to sea’ do not consider the eco-hydrological dimensions of the issue. The supporters of these projects and the politicians do not understand or deliberately ignore viewing the river as a part of the drainage basin with constitutive ecological niches, which includes its final destination of deltaic plains, interfacing with the sea.

The eco-services of the free-flowing rivers include the flushing of silt from riverbeds to the coastal waters to form deltas. Flood water is not to be rationalised as ‘surplus’. It needs to be seen as the carrier of minerals for land fertility, groundwater recharge and sustenance of biodiversity, which finally helps the livelihood of millions of marginalised people.

By diverting river water, deltaic regions are starved of water that could have helped balance saltwater from the sea. Now, however, the deltaic ecosystem will suffer from the change. The Indus Delta offers a crucial lesson. Alice Albinia, in her book, Empires of the Indus: The Story of a River (2008), narrates how a delta system at the mouth of the Indus — which was once “the richest in all Pakistan” — became impoverished when the British started barrage construction, which Pakistan continued after 1947.

Such examples are aplenty in India as well. The state of the downstream parts of the Narmada since the completion of the Sardar Sarovar dam is a modern example in the making.

The global examples of river channelisation have also proved to be major disasters. The channelisation of the Kissimmee river in the State of Florida, authorised by the U.S. Congress in 1954 to mitigate flooding, is an environmental disaster, resulting in the loss of wetlands. Massive resources are being spent to revive its original configuration. The current state of the Aral Sea — one of the world’s largest lakes — is another example of how geoengineering projects destroy natural systems. The lake has now become a howling desert after the rivers that sustained it were diverted by irrigation projects implemented during the heady days of the Soviet Union.

### The real reasons for India’s water crisis

India’s water crisis is spiralling out of control, primarily due to inadequate water management, poor environmental practices, law ambiguity, and corruption. A national water policy should embrace a holistic approach to watershed management, involving local citizens in monitoring the hydrological cycle and working alongside hydrologists, engineers, and biologists. The policy must incorporate effective aquifer management through the regulation of water usage. Farmers should be engaged to help devise strategies for efficient irrigation water usage. The government has limited control over wastewater management and should create innovative reuse programmes. A comprehensive study involving interdisciplinary expertise on river basins is essential before initiating significant water transfer projects.

In the book, Let There Be Water: Israel’s Solution for a Water-Starved World, Seth M. Siegel notes that Israel’s drip irrigation programmes save 25%-75% of pumped water. Israel’s success story in water resource management lies in modernising irrigation techniques. This also compels farmers to use less water, fertilisers and pesticides, maintaining aquifer health at an optimum level. Along with such interventions, we must incorporate elements of vernacular practices in watershed management strategies.

### **River Interlinking: The Fount of Environmental Disaster**

The **river interlinking project** in India, envisioned as a solution to water scarcity and floods, involves transferring water from surplus river basins to deficit regions through an extensive network of canals and reservoirs. While this ambitious initiative aims to address droughts, floods, and agricultural demands, it has sparked widespread concerns over its profound environmental, ecological, and socio-economic impacts.

---

### **Overview of River Interlinking in India**

- **Concept Origin:** The idea of interlinking rivers dates back to **K.L. Rao's** proposal in the 1970s and was further developed by **Captain Dastur**.  
- **National Perspective Plan (NPP):** Launched in **1980**, the plan divides the project into two components:  
  - **Himalayan Rivers Development:** Linking rivers originating from the Himalayas.  
  - **Peninsular Rivers Development:** Linking rivers in southern India.  
- **Key Projects:** **Ken-Betwa Link**, **Par-Tapi-Narmada Link**, and **Godavari-Krishna-Cauvery Link**.

5. **Climate Change Vulnerability:**  
   - Changing rainfall patterns due to climate change could render some river basins "surplus" today but "deficit" in the future, undermining the project's long-term viability.

6. **Waterlogging and Soil Salinization:**  
   - Over-irrigation and canal seepage can lead to **waterlogging** and **soil salinization**, degrading fertile agricultural lands.

7. **Impact on Wetlands and Floodplains:**  
   - Wetlands and floodplains, which naturally absorb floods and recharge groundwater, may shrink due to altered water distribution, causing ecological imbalance.

8. **Inter-State and International Water Disputes:**  
   - Diverting rivers across states could intensify **water-sharing conflicts**. International rivers like the **Brahmaputra** could strain diplomatic relations with neighboring countries like **Bangladesh**.

# Why is deciphering the Indus script important?

On January 5, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin announced a $1-million prize for experts or organisations in the event of their success in deciphering the scripts of the Indus Valley Civilisation (IVC). He made the announcement at the inauguration of an international conference to mark the centenary of the IVC discovery, which was disclosed through an article published in September 1924 by the then Director-General of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) John Marshall. That the Chief Minister of a southern State in the country had made such an announcement was due to the possible Dravidian connection with the IVC. Notwithstanding the political dimension of the Dravidian concept, historians, archaeologists and linguistic scholars have been debating over the Dravidian hypothesis ever since the publication of Marshall’s article.

### How do scholars define the Indus Valley Civilisation (IVC)?

The IVC, also called the Harappan Civilisation, spanned 2,000 sites across 1.5 million sq. km. in the territories of modern-day India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan during the Bronze Age (3000-1500 BCE). It had a wider geographical area than the combined areas of its contemporary civilisations — Egyptian and Mesopotamian. Talking of the IVC’s importance, Pakistan’s veteran archaeologist Ahmad Hasan Dani, in the December 1973 issue of UNESCO Courier, observed that the Valley lies across “ancient migration routes from central and western Asia to India.” The IVC introduced urban life for the first time in the valley when similar civilisations had developed on the banks of the Nile and the Tigris-Euphrates valleys.

### Why is deciphering the Indus script important?

Other scripts encountered in the contemporary Mesapotomian and Egyptian civilisations had been deciphered in a more satisfying manner, But, the non-decipherment of the Indus script prevents scholars from providing a complete picture of Harappan culture, which is why scholars tend to call it a “mystery script.”

### What is the Dravidian hypothesis?

The Indus script carries proto-Dravidian references— this is the position of scholars including Suniti Kumar Chatterji, Father Heras, Yri Valentinovich Knorozov, Walter Fairservis, Iravatham Mahadevan, Kamil Zvelebil, Krishnamurti and Asko Parpola — which can be found in the latest study on Indus signs and graffiti marks of Tamil Nadu.

The IVC “is non-Aryan and pre-Aryan,” argued Mahadevan in his article published in The Hindu on May 3, 2009. Attributing “solid archaeological and linguistic evidence,” the scholar, who passed away in 2018, emphasised that “the Indus script is a writing system encoding the language of the region (most probably Dravidian)”. Ruling out Aryan authorship of the civilisation, he hastened to add that this did not automatically make it Dravidian. Yet, “there is substantial linguistic evidence favouring the Dravidian theory: the survival of Brahui, a Dravidian language in the Indus region; the presence of Dravidian loanwords in the Rigveda; the substratum influence of Dravidian on the Prakrit dialects; and computer analysis of the Indus texts revealing that the language had only suffixes (like Dravidian), and no prefixes (as in Indo-Aryan) or infixes (as in Munda),” Mahadevan wrote. As the Dravidian models of decipherment had still little in common except certain basic features, “it is obvious that much more work remains to be done before a generally acceptable solution emerges,” according to him.

### What does the latest work have to offer?

Commissioned by the Tamil Nadu government’s State Department of Archaeology (TNSDA), the study, which is morphological in nature, reveals that nearly 90% of the graffiti marks found during excavations at archaeological sites in the State have parallels to those found in the Indus Valley Civilisation. “...the exact shapes and their variants found both independently and in composite forms vividly indicate that they were not accidental. It is believed that the Indus script or signs would have not disappeared without any trace[s], rather they would have transformed or evolved into different forms,” concludes K. Rajan, formerly professor with Pondicherry University and academic-research advisor to the TNSDA, and R. Sivanantham, joint director in the department, who carried out the study.

Defining the terms “graffiti” and “script,” the duo, in a monograph, explain that all the recognisable scratches engraved on the ceramics in south India and, to some extent, on Indus ceramics are identified as graffiti. The ones engraved on seals and other metal objects of the IVC are designated as script. Even though both were written by the same people, they were differentiated and documented as script and graffiti. “However, the extensive comparative study of graffiti marks and Indus scripts evidently suggests that both are undeciphered signs,” the two scholars observe.

### Which project has preceded the work?

The findings of a two-year-long project of the TNSDA, called ‘Documentation and Digitisation of Graffiti and Tamili (Tamil-Brāhmī) Inscribed Potsherds of Tamil Nadu’, have formed the basis of the monograph.

Aimed at documenting, compiling and analysing the graffiti bearing potsherds and Tamili inscribed potsherds unearthed in archaeological excavations of the State, the project, launched during 2022-23, seeks to compare those graffiti marks with the Indus script to explore whether any cultural relationship existed between the two.

The datasets from the project suggested that 15,184 graffiti-bearing potsherds were reported from 140 sites in the State and nearly 14,165 sherds were documented. Of them, nearly 2,107 signs had been morphologically categorised within a group of 42 base signs, 544 variants and 1,521 composites. Any additional strokes added to the base signs were considered variants of the base signs while a group of signs containing more than one base sign was regarded as a composite sign. “Several signs encountered in Tamil Nadu had exact parallels in the Indus scripts. Likewise, some signs had near parallels. These signs probably evolved from the base signs. Out of 42 base signs and their variants, nearly 60% of them found their parallels in the Indus script,” the document explains.

### How has the question of cultural contact between the IVC and south India been explored by the work?

The monograph talks of a “possibility of cultural exchanges.” Even though the occurrences of identical graffiti marks in south India suggest a kind of cultural contact, one needs more material evidence and tangible data to support or strengthen the view.

The recent chronometric dates indicate that when the Indus Valley experienced the Copper Age, south India experienced the Iron Age. “In this sense, the Iron Age of South [sic] India and the Copper Age of Indus are contemporary.” If that is so, there is a “possibility of cultural exchanges either through direct or intermediate zones,” the authors of the monograph point out.

The document goes on to state that the occurrence of a large number of carnelian and agate beads and high-tin bronze objects, particularly from Iron Age graves, give a clue about the contact, as carnelian, agate, copper and tin have to come from the north or elsewhere. Besides semiprecious stones and copper, a few more cultural items are required to prove the existence of contact “convincingly,” the authors state, calling for future explorations, excavations, scientific investigations and historical linguistic analysis.

> Deciphering the **Indus script** is crucial for unlocking the history, culture, and societal structure of the **Indus Valley Civilization (2600–1900 BCE)**, one of the world’s earliest urban civilizations. Understanding the script could reveal insights into their **language**, **governance**, **economy**, **religious practices**, and **trade networks**. It would bridge significant historical gaps, connecting ancient South Asian civilizations with later cultural developments. Decipherment could also clarify the civilization’s interactions with other contemporary societies and contribute to understanding the origins of **South Asian languages**. This breakthrough would greatly enrich global historical and archaeological knowledge.

# China’s long game in Africa

In 2022, when China established its first political training school in Tanzania, the Mwalimu Julius Nyerere Leadership School, its motivation was unambiguous. With an estimated cost of $40 million, the school was a tool for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to shape the future political leaders of Africa following the Chinese principles of governance.

Therefore, it is no surprise that the 120 official members of the school’s first cohort were from countries with long-standing historical ties to China. These countries continue to be ruled by the liberation parties that came into power through their pre-independence struggles. The countries include South Africa, Mozambique, Angola, Namibia, Zimbabwe, and Tanzania. In fact, these six countries, along with Botswana, are also part of the Former Liberation Movements of Southern Africa, an informal coalition meant to help one another address governance challenges and stay in power.

Clearly, the move by China to establish the political school is meant to strengthen its relationship and increase its influence among the policymakers of these countries. The political school is another platform for the leaders of these ruling liberation parties to enhance their governance capabilities through shared educational resources. This is also an example of China’s broader strategy to shape Africa’s political landscape by promoting its governance model based on the centrality of the ruling party and its control over the state.

### Game of influence

There are several ways for a country to assert its influence. One way could be mediation or fostering dialogue among the concerned parties to facilitate positive conversations. This also helps in building a strong global image for the mediator country. Historically, the U.S. has been the most influential international mediator. However, China is increasingly asserting itself in this role, as seen in its involvement in resolving the Saudi Arabia-Iran and Niger-Benin disputes.

As China seeks to establish an alternative world order — often complementary to, and sometimes in contrast with, the Western-led global system — it recognises the importance of Africa’s support in various multilateral forums. Africa, with 55 countries, is a significant player in international relations. And so, Beijing is intensifying its efforts to build strong ties with Africa as part of its broader strategy to shift the global balance in its favour.

However, China’s engagement in Africa’s politics is not a recent phenomenon. Beijing has supported African independence movements, military endeavours, and governance structures. It has also helped develop African economies through investments in infrastructure and industrial projects. This historical relationship continues to be strong, as China intensifies its focus on strengthening ties with Africa’s ruling parties.

‘Study tours’ have remained a key part of China’s public diplomacy with Africa. Every year, hundreds of African officials visit China for lectures at universities, visits to provincial governments, and cultural exchanges designed to familiarise them with Chinese traditions and governance practices.

Only now has China’s game plan to influence African political elites expanded through the introduction of political schools. During the 8th Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in 2021, China acknowledged its ties to over 100 political parties across 51 African countries.

China’s growing influence in Africa is evident not only in the establishment of new educational institutions but also in the deepening of its political relationships. Kenya, for example, has expressed its interest in having a leadership school that would be financed by and modelled on the CCP’s Central Party School. These efforts are accompanied by investments in infrastructure. China funded the construction of Kenya’s new foreign ministry headquarters, as the two countries were celebrating 60 years of diplomatic relations.

China is not only constructing new institutions, but also refurbishing many existing ones. For instance, China funded the renovation of the Herbert Chitepo School of Ideology in Zimbabwe. Through such initiatives, it aims to establish a governance model similar to its own, based on strong, centralised party systems that offer stability and control. This highlights the effectiveness of building reciprocal relationships, particularly in countries where leadership stability and centralisation are highly valued.

### Chinese diplomacy in Africa

China’s approach to Africa is built on decades of patient diplomacy. While the Nyerere Leadership School represents a significant milestone, it is only one piece of China’s broader strategy to embed itself deeply within Africa’s political fabric. China’s long-term goal is to promote a Sino-centric world order in which it plays a central role in shaping global governance structures.

However, China is also mindful of potential regime changes in Africa. It knows the importance of nurturing opposition parties to safeguard its interests in case political shifts occur. By establishing political schools and cultivating bonds with ruling and opposition parties, China is ensuring that its influence is intact regardless of political transitions.

China’s long game in Africa is not just about economic influence or military strength. It is also about the subtle art of diplomacy and influence. Through its strategic investments in Africa’s political future, China is ensuring that it remains a key player in shaping Africa’s governance structures for years to come.

### **China’s Long Game in Africa**

China's expanding influence in Africa is part of a long-term strategic approach aimed at securing economic, political, and geopolitical advantages. Driven by its need for natural resources, market expansion, and global influence, China has established deep-rooted ties across the African continent through **infrastructure development**, **trade**, **investment**, and **diplomatic engagement**. This strategy, often referred to as China's "long game" in Africa, is reshaping Africa’s economic landscape and altering global power dynamics.

# The right to food and the struggle with the PDS

In 2023, there was a report discussing the right to food in the context of Jharkhand. Similarly, a few days ago, there was another report that was in the context of Odisha. These reports highlighted something alarming — that a substantial number of households have been removed from the rolls of the Public Distribution System (PDS). This disturbing situation is not limited to Jharkhand and Odisha. Bihar, another State in the east-central region, has its own PDS tragedy.

### The example of the Musahar community

Bihar was blighted by a supply crisis, when rations were needed the most, at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, there are communities which continue to be in want of a stable supply of ration. This is more notable among extremely marginalised communities such as the Musahars. This is a community that has been pushed beyond the edge of destitution by the socio-politics of caste. Its struggle with the PDS emerges as a significant symptom of the same.

A number of Musahar households in Patna district do not have an active ration card. Even if they do have one, there is another problem — the card does not have the names of all the family members.

There are also several people who have lost access to their monthly supply of ration ever since biometric verification was made mandatory at fair price shops (FPS). In such cases, the individuals concerned are forced to get a new ration card as after verification it emerges that their names have been struck off the PDS rolls. The ruling dispensation and its over the top marketing of ‘smart cities’ clearly posits before us the disconnect between the government and the people most in need of state welfare.

Problems with the PDS are not limited to enrolment and access. There is also the flow of corruption through the veins of the system. Households enrolled with the PDS have reported that FPS dealers have been releasing only four kilograms of food grain/person when a below poverty line (BPL) household which has a Priority Household (PHH) ration card is entitled to five kilograms a person. The four kilograms of grain being issued is rice, which is the lowest quality of ‘Usna’ rice. No amount of wheat is issued.

### Documentation that has no legal basis

Coming back to the issue of enrolment in PDS. The Government of Bihar offers its citizens the option to file a ration card application using a paper-based application form or by filling in an online application form through its e-PDS portal. The first option requires the Aadhaar details of the applicant and their family members. The second option requires an extra set of documents, namely caste certificate, income certificate, and residence certificate. Even when the applicant uses the first method, the officials eventually demand these certificates.

The demand for such documents is not exclusive to Bihar. Jharkhand also makes such a demand while Uttar Pradesh makes it mandatory to provide an income certificate, and Madhya Pradesh requires the submission of proof of residence.

The requirements of these certificates do not have any legal basis. Neither the National Food Security Act (NFSA) of 2013 nor the PDS control order of 2015 explicate the requirement of such documents. An officer from the Food and Consumer Protection Department in Bihar has confirmed that the requirement of those certificates is an oversight in the online system. Here again we see that in the race towards digitisation and e-governance, governments have shed all and any conception of governance and citizen welfare.

### The issue of exploitation

It is notable, and most unfortunate, that the government, which has complete awareness of its systemic flaws, has made no attempt at systemic change and that people continue to be crushed under the weight of official indifference. To make matters worse, this hubris of power has provided the perfect conditions for the creation of a market of exploitation.

Most of the people, especially in the Musahar community, who seek to avail the benefits of PDS, neither have the resources nor the knowledge to interact with online processes. This situation has been aggressively exploited by middlemen who charge a sum that is north of ₹3,000 to have a ration card made. Within this market of exploitation, it is not uncommon to hear that neither document was issued nor the middleman traceable after payment.

Amidst the myriad challenges, if the people are somehow able to file their application, there is still no guarantee that they will get their ration card. While the 2015 order states that ration card should be issued within 30 days of the application being filled, there are cases of people whose applications have been pending for long — between four to 18 months. These applications are not for an entitlement which goes above and beyond the diurnal needs of a person. They are for the basic means of subsistence. It has been 24 years since the right to food was recognised as a fundamental right in the case, People’s Union of Civil Liberties vs Union of India. Since then, governments have wound bureaucratic red tape around it so tightly that it is choking the very people it was meant for.

### **The Right to Food and the Struggle with the Public Distribution System (PDS)**

**The Right to Food** is a fundamental human right recognized under international frameworks and enshrined in India’s legal and constitutional framework. Despite numerous initiatives, India continues to grapple with challenges in ensuring equitable food security, primarily due to inefficiencies in the **Public Distribution System (PDS)**, which is the backbone of food security for millions of economically vulnerable citizens.

---

### **The Right to Food in India**

1. **Constitutional Backing:**  
   - While not explicitly mentioned, the **Right to Food** is derived from **Article 21** of the Indian Constitution, which guarantees the **Right to Life and Personal Liberty**.  
   - **Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP)** under **Article 47** direct the state to raise nutrition levels and improve public health.

2. **Judicial Recognition:**  
   - The Supreme Court, in the **PUCL vs. Union of India (2001)** case, recognized the Right to Food as an essential component of the Right to Life, mandating the government to ensure food security for all.

3. **Legislative Framework:**  
   - The **National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013** legally entitles 75% of the rural and 50% of the urban population to subsidized food grains through the PDS.  
   - Key components include the **Mid-Day Meal Scheme**, **Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS)**, and **Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS)**.

---

### **Public Distribution System (PDS): An Overview**

The **PDS** is India’s largest food security program, providing subsidized food grains to the poor through a nationwide network of **Fair Price Shops (FPS)**.

**Key Features:**  
- Distribution of **wheat**, **rice**, **sugar**, and **kerosene** at subsidized rates.  
- Managed by the **Food Corporation of India (FCI)** for procurement, storage, and distribution.  
- The **Targeted PDS (TPDS)**, introduced in **1997**, aimed to focus on **Below Poverty Line (BPL)** families while excluding the non-poor.

---

### **Challenges in the PDS**

1. **Leakages and Diversion:**  
   - Significant portions of subsidized food grains are diverted to the black market or pilfered before reaching beneficiaries.  
   - According to reports, over **30-40%** of PDS food grains are lost due to corruption and inefficiencies.

2. **Identification of Beneficiaries:**  
   - Errors in identifying **BPL** families lead to the exclusion of deserving households and inclusion of ineligible ones.

3. **Corruption and Middlemen:**  
   - Corrupt practices by dealers and middlemen reduce the effectiveness of food distribution.  
   - Ghost beneficiaries and fake ration cards exacerbate leakages.

4. **Poor Quality of Grains:**  
   - Low-quality or spoiled food grains often reach beneficiaries, undermining nutritional security.

5. **Infrastructure and Storage Issues:**  
   - Inadequate storage facilities cause wastage due to **rotting**, **pest attacks**, and **weather damage**.

6. **Regional Disparities:**  
   - PDS performance varies across states, with more efficient implementation in states like **Tamil Nadu** and **Chhattisgarh**, and poor outcomes in others.

7. **Limited Nutritional Diversity:**  
   - PDS focuses mainly on **cereals**, neglecting pulses, oils, and other nutritious foods, limiting its impact on nutrition security.

8. **Technological Challenges:**  
   - While **Aadhaar-based biometric authentication** was introduced to plug leakages, technological failures often lead to exclusion due to fingerprint mismatches or connectivity issues.

---

### **Efforts to Strengthen PDS**

1. **Digitization and Aadhaar Linkage:**  
   - Linking **ration cards** with **Aadhaar** to eliminate fake beneficiaries and reduce leakages.  
   - Introduction of **e-POS machines** for transparent transactions at Fair Price Shops.

2. **One Nation, One Ration Card (ONORC):**  
   - Launched in **2019**, it allows beneficiaries to access their entitlements across India, aiding **migrant workers**.

3. **Decentralized Procurement:**  
   - States are encouraged to procure locally grown grains, ensuring food security and supporting local farmers.

4. **Community Participation:**  
   - Involving **Gram Panchayats**, **Self-Help Groups (SHGs)**, and **NGOs** in monitoring PDS functioning.

5. **Diversification of Food Basket:**  
   - Proposals to include **pulses**, **edible oils**, and **nutritious grains** under the PDS to improve dietary diversity.

---

### **Way Forward for Effective Food Security**

1. **Strengthening Transparency and Accountability:**  
   - Implementing **social audits**, **community monitoring**, and **Grievance Redressal Mechanisms** to ensure accountability.

2. **Technological Integration:**  
   - Expanding the use of **blockchain technology** for supply chain transparency and improving biometric systems to reduce exclusion.

3. **Targeted Nutritional Security:**  
   - Including a wider range of **nutritious foods** in the PDS to tackle malnutrition and hidden hunger.

4. **Infrastructure Modernization:**  
   - Enhancing storage infrastructure with modern **warehouses**, **cold storage**, and **transportation systems**.

5. **Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT):**  
   - Gradual shift to **DBT** in some areas, allowing beneficiaries to purchase food directly from the market.

6. **Focus on Marginalized Groups:**  
   - Prioritizing food security for **tribal**, **migrant**, and **disaster-affected** populations who often face exclusion.

---

### **Conclusion**

The **Right to Food** is fundamental for ensuring human dignity and well-being. While the **Public Distribution System (PDS)** plays a pivotal role in realizing this right, it is plagued by systemic inefficiencies, corruption, and exclusion errors. Addressing these challenges requires comprehensive reforms focused on **transparency**, **technology-driven solutions**, and **inclusive policies**. Strengthening the PDS and diversifying food security measures can help India achieve its goal of eradicating hunger and ensuring **nutritional security** for all, making the constitutional promise of the Right to Food a tangible reality.

> The **Right to Food** in India, derived from **Article 21**, aims to ensure food security for all, primarily through the **Public Distribution System (PDS)**. Despite its significance, the PDS faces challenges like **leakages**, **corruption**, **poor-quality grains**, and **exclusion errors**. Efforts like **Aadhaar linkage**, **digitization**, and the **One Nation, One Ration Card (ONORC)** scheme aim to improve efficiency. Strengthening transparency, modernizing infrastructure, diversifying food distribution, and including marginalized communities are essential reforms. A robust and inclusive PDS is crucial for fulfilling India's commitment to the **Right to Food** and eradicating hunger.
