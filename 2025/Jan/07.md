# Nine killed in IED blast by suspected Maoists in Bijapur

### Red Corridor and Maoist Insurgency in India

#### **The Red Corridor:**
The term **Red Corridor** refers to a region in India that is significantly affected by **Left-Wing Extremism (LWE)**, primarily Maoist insurgency. It stretches across several states in central, eastern, and southern India, including Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha, Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Maharashtra.

#### **Key Characteristics:**
1. **Geographical Spread:** The Red Corridor spans remote and forested areas, often overlapping with tribal regions where governance is weak.
2. **Socio-Economic Backdrop:** The region is marked by poverty, illiteracy, and underdevelopment. These factors create fertile ground for insurgency.
3. **Maoist Stronghold:** Maoist rebels, also known as **Naxalites**, draw support from marginalized communities, particularly tribal populations, who often face exploitation and displacement due to mining and industrial projects.
4. **Security Concerns:** The Red Corridor remains a significant challenge to India's internal security, with frequent attacks on security forces, government establishments, and infrastructure.

---

#### **Maoist Insurgency:**
Maoism in India traces its roots to the **Naxalbari uprising of 1967** in West Bengal. This movement was inspired by Mao Zedong's principles of agrarian revolution and sought to address issues like land redistribution and social justice through armed struggle.

##### **Core Objectives:**
- Overthrow of the Indian state.
- Establishment of a "people's government" through guerrilla warfare.

---

#### **Current Scenario:**
1. **Strength of Maoists:** Despite counter-insurgency efforts, Maoists continue to maintain an underground network and conduct ambushes, like the recent IED attack in Bijapur, Chhattisgarh.
2. **Strategic Areas:** Chhattisgarh, especially the **Bastar division**, is considered a Maoist heartland due to dense forests and inaccessible terrain.
3. **Tactics Used:**
   - Guerrilla warfare and ambushes.
   - Use of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs).
   - Targeting security forces and civilian contractors involved in developmental projects.

---

#### **Government Response:**
1. **Operation Green Hunt (2009):** A coordinated effort to combat Maoist insurgency through paramilitary operations.
2. **Developmental Initiatives:**
   - Enhancing infrastructure (roads, schools, healthcare).
   - Skill development and employment generation for tribal youth.
3. **SAMADHAN Doctrine:** A strategy focusing on **Smart Leadership, Aggressive Strategy, Motivation and Training, Actionable Intelligence, Dashboard-Based KPIs (Key Performance Indicators), Harnessing Technology, and No access to finances**.
4. **Dialogue and Rehabilitation:** Efforts to integrate surrendered Maoists into the mainstream by offering rehabilitation packages.

---

#### **Challenges:**
1. **Lack of Trust:** Many tribal populations view government initiatives with suspicion due to a history of displacement and exploitation.
2. **Terrain and Logistics:** The rugged terrain and dense forests hinder counter-insurgency operations.
3. **Intelligence Failures:** The recent attack in Bijapur underscores persistent lapses in actionable intelligence.
4. **Alienation of Tribals:** Unaddressed socio-economic grievances continue to drive people toward Maoist ideology.

---

#### **Conclusion:**
The Maoist insurgency in the Red Corridor is a multifaceted challenge involving security, governance, and socio-economic development. While military operations are necessary to contain violence, the long-term solution lies in addressing the root causes of the insurgency—poverty, inequality, and lack of development. A holistic approach combining security measures, community engagement, and inclusive development is essential to bring peace to the region.

> The **Red Corridor**, spanning several Indian states, is a region significantly affected by **Maoist insurgency**, rooted in the Naxalbari uprising of 1967. Maoists, also known as **Naxalites**, aim to overthrow the state through guerrilla warfare, exploiting issues like poverty, underdevelopment, and tribal displacement. Chhattisgarh's Bastar division is a Maoist stronghold, frequently witnessing violent attacks like the recent IED blast in Bijapur. The government counters through military operations (e.g., **Operation Green Hunt**), developmental projects, and rehabilitation programs under the **SAMADHAN doctrine**. However, socio-economic grievances and alienation of tribals hinder progress, necessitating a balanced approach of security, governance, and inclusive development.

### Governor's Role and Federal Principles in India: A Critical Analysis

#### **Role of the Governor in Indian Polity:**
The Governor is the constitutional head of a state, appointed by the **President of India** under **Article 155** of the Constitution. As a bridge between the Union and the State, the Governor performs executive, legislative, and discretionary functions.

1. **Executive Role:** Acts on the advice of the Council of Ministers headed by the Chief Minister under **Article 163**, except in matters requiring discretion.
2. **Legislative Role:** Summons, prorogues, and dissolves the state legislature; gives assent to bills; reserves bills for Presidential consideration under **Article 200**.
3. **Discretionary Role:** Exercises discretion in cases like recommending President’s Rule under **Article 356**, or reserving bills for Presidential assent.

---

#### **Federal Principles and the Governor’s Office:**
India follows a **quasi-federal structure**, with power divided between the Union and the states. The Governor plays a pivotal role in maintaining federal harmony. However, tensions often arise when the Governor appears to act in a partisan manner, undermining the principles of cooperative federalism.

---

#### **Deterioration of Federal Principles:**
The relationship between the Governor and Chief Ministers (CMs) has often been contentious, leading to allegations of bias and misuse of the Governor’s office. This undermines the federal principle in the following ways:

1. **Interference in State Autonomy:**
   - Instances of Governors bypassing the elected government’s advice or delaying assent to legislation challenge the autonomy of state governments.
   - For example, reserving state bills for Presidential consideration without valid reasons disrupts state governance.

2. **Frequent Political Controversies:**
   - Governors have occasionally clashed with CMs, as seen in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and West Bengal, over policy matters and legislative addresses.
   - In Tamil Nadu, Governor R.N. Ravi’s refusal to read the customary address and objections to procedural practices highlights such tensions.

3. **Misuse of Article 356:**
   - Recommendations for President’s Rule based on partisan assessments have been criticized for destabilizing state governments, as seen during several instances in the 1980s and 1990s.

4. **Disregard for Constitutional Norms:**
   - By selectively exercising discretion or withholding assent to bills, the Governor can stall state-level legislative and executive functions.
   - For example, the delay in approving the Tamil Nadu government’s bill to ban online gambling showcased this issue.

5. **Cultural Insensitivities:**
   - Controversies arise when Governors disregard local customs or practices, as in Tamil Nadu, where playing the state’s invocation before the address became a flashpoint.

---

#### **Impact on Governance:**
1. **Erosion of Trust:** A contentious Governor-CM relationship creates mistrust and impairs collaborative governance.
2. **Policy Paralysis:** Delays in assent to bills and disagreements on administrative matters stall crucial state policies.
3. **Undermining Democracy:** The perception of Governors acting as agents of the Union rather than impartial constitutional heads weakens democratic institutions.

---

#### **Way Forward:**
1. **Reforms in Appointment Process:**
   - Introduce transparency and consultation mechanisms involving the CM in the appointment of Governors to ensure non-partisanship.
   
2. **Strict Adherence to Constitutional Norms:**
   - Governors must act as neutral arbiters, following the advice of the elected state government, barring exceptional circumstances.

3. **Guidelines for Discretionary Powers:**
   - Clearly define and limit the Governor’s discretionary powers to avoid misuse.

4. **Strengthening Federal Cooperation:**
   - Promote mechanisms for dialogue and coordination between the Union and states to resolve disputes amicably.

5. **Judicial Oversight:**
   - Strengthen judicial review over the Governor’s actions, particularly in cases of delayed assent or misuse of Article 356.

---

#### **Conclusion:**
The Governor, as a constitutional authority, plays a crucial role in India’s federal setup. However, recurring disputes between Governors and CMs have strained the federal fabric. Reforms in the appointment process, adherence to constitutional norms, and fostering cooperative federalism are essential to restore the dignity of the Governor’s office and uphold India’s federal principles. The ultimate goal should be to ensure that the Governor acts as a facilitator of governance, not a disruptor of democratic processes.

> The Governor, as the constitutional head of a state, plays a crucial role in India’s federal framework, but tensions with Chief Ministers often disrupt cooperative federalism. Instances of partisan actions, such as withholding assent to bills, bypassing state advice, or recommending President’s Rule under Article 356, undermine state autonomy and governance. Recent controversies, like Tamil Nadu Governor R.N. Ravi’s refusal to follow legislative customs, highlight these issues. To address this, reforms in the Governor's appointment process, adherence to constitutional norms, limited discretionary powers, and strengthened dialogue between the Union and states are essential to restore trust and uphold India’s federal principles.

# The Collegium and changes — it may still be early days

### Analysis of the Collegium System and Judicial Appointments in India

#### **1. Context of the Collegium System:**
- The collegium system for judicial appointments is a result of judicial interpretation in the **Second Judges Case (1993)**. It redefined "consultation" in judicial appointments to mean "concurrence," giving primacy to the judiciary in appointing judges.
- It seeks to maintain judicial independence by minimizing executive interference, a principle fundamental to the Constitution’s vision of separation of powers.

---

#### **2. Structure and Process of the Collegium System:**
- **Composition:** The collegium comprises the Chief Justice of India (CJI) and a panel of senior judges.
- **Functions:**
  - Recommending appointments and transfers of High Court and Supreme Court judges.
  - Consulting with other judges for input before making decisions.
- **Procedure:**
  - The collegium sends recommendations to the government.
  - The government may accept, return for reconsideration, or delay action. However, once the collegium reiterates its recommendation, the government is obligated to act.

---

#### **3. Issues in the Collegium System:**
1. **Lack of Transparency:**
   - The process lacks formal rules, making it opaque and susceptible to subjective biases.
   - Decisions, including criteria for selection, are not published, creating an aura of mystique.

2. **Ad Hocism:**
   - The collegium operates without codified procedures, relying instead on an unwritten “memorandum of procedure” that carries no binding consequences for breaches.

3. **Government Stonewalling:**
   - Despite judicial primacy, the government delays recommendations, undermining the judiciary’s independence.
   - Instances of prolonged inaction by the executive disrupt the appointment process, rendering the judiciary dependent on the government for implementation.

4. **Judicial Independence at Risk:**
   - Executive inertia challenges the judiciary's ability to function autonomously.
   - The judiciary’s lack of enforcement mechanisms allows the executive to stymie the process without accountability.

---

#### **4. Constitutional and Historical Context:**
- **Constituent Assembly Debates:**
  - The framers envisioned a “middle course” balancing executive consultation with judicial independence.
  - Articles 124 and 217 provide for consultation with the CJI and other judges but do not elaborate on the process.

- **Judges' Cases:**
  - **Second Judges Case (1993):** Established the collegium system.
  - **Fourth Judges Case (2015):** Reiterated judicial primacy, striking down the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) as violative of the Constitution's basic structure.

---

#### **5. Implications of Current Practices:**
- **Rule of Law:**
  - Delays in implementing collegium recommendations contravene the law as laid down by the Supreme Court.
  - Non-compliance with judicial rulings undermines the judiciary’s authority and the Constitution’s mandate.

- **Accountability vs. Independence:**
  - The absence of a robust framework linking accountability with independence weakens public trust in the judiciary.
  - Without reforms, the system remains vulnerable to executive overreach and internal inconsistencies.

---

#### **6. Reforms Needed:**
1. **Codification of Procedures:**
   - Establish formal, binding rules for the collegium’s functioning to ensure consistency and transparency.
2. **Timely Compliance:**
   - Mandate timelines for the government to act on recommendations, with legal consequences for non-compliance.
3. **Enhanced Transparency:**
   - Publish reasons for selections and rejections to build public confidence.
4. **Collaborative Approach:**
   - Promote better coordination between the judiciary and the executive to reduce conflicts and ensure smoother functioning.

---

#### **7. Conclusion:**
The collegium system, while imperfect, safeguards judicial independence in India. However, its opaque functioning and the government’s ability to delay implementation undermine its objectives. Reforms aimed at codifying procedures, enhancing transparency, and ensuring timely compliance by the government are essential to strengthen the system. The judiciary must assert its rulings while fostering cooperation to maintain the balance of power envisioned in the Constitution.

> The collegium system, established in the **Second Judges Case (1993)**, gives primacy to the judiciary in judicial appointments to ensure independence. However, its opaque and ad hoc functioning, coupled with the government's frequent delays in acting on recommendations, undermines its effectiveness. The lack of codified procedures, binding rules, and transparency weakens public trust and risks executive overreach. While the system safeguards judicial independence, reforms are needed to address these challenges. Codifying procedures, mandating timely compliance by the government, and fostering cooperation between the judiciary and executive are essential to strengthen the system and uphold the Constitution’s vision of separation of powers.

# Enhancing governance the digital way

In recent years, India has embarked on an ambitious journey toward digital governance — a transformation designed not only to improve citizen services but also to bolster the capabilities of government employees. This effort underscores a critical truth: the efficiency of public service delivery is inextricably linked to the skills and competencies of the workforce behind it. Yet, despite the strides made, the question remains — what more needs to be done to fully realise the potential of this digital shift?

At its core, governance is a complex web of decision-making processes that involves stakeholders, from government bodies and non-governmental organisations to local community leaders and influential citizens. Chanakya’s governance principles have left a lasting impact, particularly in South Asia, shaping modern governance theories, public administration, and strategic diplomacy, with the Arthashastra’s insights into statecraft, economic policy, and ethical leadership continuing to serve as a framework for political strategy and governance ethics. In this context, building the capacity of participants to integrate digital tools has become essential to reimagining governance at every level.

### Capacity building in digital governance

Digital governance represents a paradigm shift in how government employees and associated service providers or intermediaries such as contractors should engage with their work. The adoption of technology in governance facilitates more effective communication, informed decision-making, and streamlined workflows. As public expectations evolve, so too must the skill-set of those in governance roles. The pressing need for government employees to become adept at navigating digital platforms is paramount in a world that is increasingly technology-driven.

Initiatives such as the **iGOT Karmayogi** platform have taken centre-stage. Launched in 2020, this online training portal aims to equip government officials with essential skills in data analytics, public administration, and digital technologies. The flexibility of personalised learning paths fosters continuous improvement — a vital trait where adaptability defines success.

Equally transformative is the e-Office initiative, which digitises government workflows, drastically reducing reliance on paperwork and enhancing operational efficiency. By automating file management, workflows, and grievance redress, the initiative promotes real-time communication and transparency. Another initiative is the transition of procurement processes to the online sphere, with platforms like the **Government e-Marketplace (GeM)** playing a crucial role.

The government’s commitment to enhancing digital literacy is commendable, with various programmes aimed at familiarising employees with the essential tools of e-governance, cybersecurity, and digital communication. However, as we celebrate these advancements, it is imperative to recognise the challenges that lie ahead in this digital governance journey.

### Taking digital empowerment forward

Despite these initiatives, hurdles remain that could undermine progress. The resistance to change among some segments of the workforce presents a tangible challenge. Bureaucratic structures can sometimes be slow to adapt, with varying levels of enthusiasm and readiness among employees. While some quickly embrace new technologies, others may benefit from extra training and support to effectively navigate the digital landscape. The government must foster an environment that encourages innovation while providing the necessary resources for those who may resist or struggle to adapt.

The lack of incentives raises concerns that government initiatives such as the iGOT Karmayogi platform could become merely attendance trackers. True success should not be measured by participation numbers alone but by the platform’s ability to deliver real value to employees. It is worth considering whether these trainings lead to meaningful outcomes — such as opportunities to apply new skills through relevant job postings — rather than just enhancing performance reviews.

Additionally, the digital divide is a pressing issue, especially in rural areas where access to high-speed Internet and digital tools can be limited. Without addressing this disparity, we risk leaving many employees, and by extension, many citizens behind in an increasingly digital world.

Cybersecurity also looms large as a concern in the digital governance landscape. As government operations shift online, the risk of data breaches and cyberattacks escalates. Protecting sensitive information is non-negotiable, and training employees in cybersecurity protocols is critical to fortifying digital governance systems.

Finally, the need for continuous learning cannot be overstated. The rapid evolution of digital tools necessitates ongoing training and upskilling opportunities to ensure that employees remain capable and confident in their roles. Ensuring that capacity-building programmes remain dynamic and adaptable to new developments is crucial.

### A perspective

India’s digital governance initiatives have laid a strong foundation, but much remains to fully harness the potential of digital transformation.

With robust infrastructure, targeted training, and a commitment to building a dynamic workforce, India can set a global benchmark for digital governance. The key lies in ensuring that every employee, regardless of background, rank, or location, is equipped to excel in the digital age. Only then can we achieve a governance model that is accountable, transparent, and inclusive for all.

> Digital governance leverages technology to improve government efficiency, transparency, and service delivery. Initiatives like **Digital India** aim to transform public services through e-governance, digital infrastructure, and citizen empowerment. Key tools include online portals, mobile applications, and data-driven decision-making systems. Digital governance enhances transparency by reducing corruption and enables inclusive growth by reaching remote and underserved populations. Challenges include bridging the digital divide, ensuring data privacy, and building robust cybersecurity frameworks. To maximize benefits, governments must focus on capacity building, digital literacy, and fostering public-private partnerships. Embracing technology-driven governance is crucial for a more accountable and responsive administration.

# The end of global climate policy

The climate conference in Baku in 2024 turned the climate treaty on its head by scrapping the defining feature of the post-colonial world divided between ‘donors’ and ‘recipients’ and suggesting the need for an alternate global sustainability forum. The shift requires that developing countries take charge of their own destiny.

The purpose of the climate treaty in 1992 was to collectively deal with a common concern. In an unequal world, this was defined by the G7 reducing future emissions of carbon dioxide despite the treaty acknowledging cumulative emissions alone matter. Developing countries agreed to take on a problem they did not create in exchange for technology transfer and funds, not realising that the imbalance in research capacity had set the stage for shifting the burden.

The backbone of the current arrangement is the disconnect between academic treatment and rules and practice, providing continuing advantage to the G7. The way global concerns have been selected, agenda defined, and rules implemented — all the time dealing with the symptoms rather than the causes of problems — provides continuing advantages to the G7. The pressure to provide incentives for private finance and dealing with trade restrictions at the same time was never part of the ‘grand bargain’. The G7 have now absolved themselves of any responsibility for climate change with, in India’s words, the “optical illusion” of providing financial support by 2035.

### Two world views

The former colonial powers morphed into the G7 in 1973. Climate change with its reduction in emissions of carbon dioxide is only for the G7 who have overused their fair share of the common atmospheric resource. For the others, the greatest challenge is sustainable development, that is, modifying pathways, lifestyles and energy transition. The way the agenda was set masks the injustice within the climate crisis and the extent it is underestimated.

The impact of the Global South, representing four-fifths of the global population and half the GDP, no longer following the lead of the G7 has been felt most significantly in climate change with growing calls for climate justice. The Nationally Determined Contributions of 72 countries explicitly include the concept of a “just transition”, reflecting recognition of the social dimensions of climate action.

Climate justice is not about perceptions of fairness of specific policies. It questions the framing of existing distinctions between global and local levels and between mitigation and adaptation. It is not just the disproportionate continuing levels of emissions but also solutions such as carbon pricing and trade restrictions that widen the income gap and increase inequality. Current global rules do not reflect the interests of the Global South.

These views reflect conflicting visions of how society is organised and what constitutes progress. Distinguishing between total emissions of countries and trends, drivers, and patterns of natural resource use as causes of climate change masks the impact of the most stable global trend of urbanisation covering three-quarters of global emissions and natural resource use. A middle class and more equal world is adopting opinions, pathways, and actions distinct from those who developed earlier.

The foundational fact is that patterns of urban natural resource use of the G7 are not being followed by the Global South. The G7 with one-fifth the population was consuming three-quarters of global resources in 1950, with the U.S. alone consuming 40%. By the 1970s, three-quarters of the population of the G7 had shifted to cities and their lifestyles based on commodity prices kept low by the former colonial powers directly led to climate change. The real price of the most traded commodity, oil, was not allowed to increase over a century, leading to its wasteful use. In 2050, the G7 will account for 25% of global emissions with a 10% share of the global population, while Asia is expected to account for 55% of the world’s emissions equal to its share of the global population.

The time is ripe for new foundational principles of sustainability with justice at its centre. India would have to match the strategic thinking of the U.S. in setting up interlinked voluntary arrangements of the ‘rules-based order’, with the rules determined by the G7, for a new order for ‘shared prosperity’ seeking comparable levels of well-being within ecological limits.

### Global governance

With global cooperation itself in danger, three initiatives are suggested. First, BRICS and partner countries should take the strategic leap for an alternate sustainability forum to support each other in the urban energy transition. This would not be an anti-G7 forum, but focused on units located in member countries in different continents researching sustainability science, urbanisation, monitoring G7 climate policy and supporting exchange of experiences.

Second, the UN Climate negotiations should be limited to reviewing emissions reductions in the G7 and grants in the $300 billion to the most vulnerable — Small Island States and Least Developed Countries.

Third, international fora should be seen as what they are: annual stocktaking that helps the world assess its position and decide course-correction accordingly. The World Trade Organization with its dysfunctional dispute settlement could also be allowed to wither away.

The BRICS playing a bridging role in the new multilateralism will entitle them to their rightful place in the UN Security Council.

> The article critiques the inefficacy of global climate policies, highlighting that despite international agreements like the Paris Accord, emissions continue to rise, and tangible progress remains elusive. It argues that fragmented national interests and lack of accountability hinder meaningful action. Many nations prioritize economic growth over environmental commitments, while global forums struggle with enforcement mechanisms. The shift toward localized and adaptive strategies, tailored to regional challenges, may replace ineffective global frameworks. To combat climate change effectively, the focus must shift from lofty global pledges to practical, decentralized actions that align local priorities with global sustainability goals.

# What is the human meta- pneumovirus?

China’s diseases control authority said that it was piloting a monitoring system for pneumonia of unknown origin. The country was already witnessing an upward trend in overall infections as of mid-December, and is expecting to see more respiratory infections in the winter and spring. One of the pathogens that was detected, especially among people under the age of 14, was human metapneumovirus. Subsequently, posts showing crowds of people in what looked like Chinese hospitals appeared on social media along with statements about China declaring an emergency over the virus. So far, there has been no such declaration.

### What is human metapneumovirus?

Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a respiratory virus that causes mild infections similar to that caused by a common cold. First identified by scientists in 2001, the virus belongs to the Pneumoviridae family, of which respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), measles and mumps are also members. HMPV can cause both upper and lower respiratory tract infections and is generally seen in winter and early spring. Children, the elderly and those with weakened immune systems are more susceptible to the infection and to developing complications from it. The symptoms of HMPV can resemble those caused by a common cold. They include a cough, runny or blocked nose, sore, throat, fever and wheezing. The estimated incubation period is three to six days. In most people, the illness goes away on its own within a few days, with rest and supportive care at home. In a few people however, complications such as bronchitis or pneumonia may arise, requiring medical care.

### How does HMPV spread?

HMPV spreads through contact with an infected person or touching objects that have the virus on them. This can be through secretions from coughs and sneezes; close contact with someone who has the infection by shaking hands, hugging; touching a doorknob or a phone or a keyboard that may be contaminated with the virus and then touching the mouth, nose or eyes.

### How is HMPV treated?

There is no vaccine and no specific antiviral to treat HMPV. Most people require over-the-counter medications to relieve fever and pain, possibly with a decongestant. Antibiotics will not work for HMPV. However, the virus can be prevented. As with most other respiratory viruses, the best way to protect yourself from illness is to wash your hands frequently with soap and water, avoid close contact with infected persons, avoid touching your face, nose, eyes and mouth and wear a mask if you think you may be infected, so that you can prevent transmitting it to others. People with lung conditions such as asthma or COPD should be extra cautious and protect themselves from infection.

### What has the Indian govt. said?

In light of the reports from China, the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) under the Union Health Ministry is closely monitoring respiratory and seasonal influenza cases in the country, and is in touch with international agencies. “We will continue to monitor the situation closely, validate information and update accordingly,” sources said.

HMPV cases have been confirmed in two infants from Karnataka and one in Ahmedabad, Gujarat. In Chennai too, two children tested postive for the virus. The Union Health Minister J.P. Nadda in a video statement said, “Health experts have clarified that the HMPV is not a new virus. It was first identified in 2001 and it has been circulating in the entire world for many years. HMPV spreads through air, by way of respiration... The health systems and surveillance networks of the country are vigilant and there is no reason to worry.”

> Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a respiratory virus first identified in 2001, belonging to the **Paramyxoviridae** family. It primarily affects the respiratory tract, causing illnesses ranging from mild cold-like symptoms to severe respiratory infections, particularly in young children, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. Symptoms include fever, cough, nasal congestion, and shortness of breath, often resembling those of the flu or other respiratory viruses. It spreads via respiratory droplets and close contact. While no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine exists, management focuses on supportive care. Preventive measures include hand hygiene, respiratory etiquette, and avoiding contact with infected individuals.
