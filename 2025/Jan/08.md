   - Jammu & Kashmir was reorganized into a UT along with Ladakh in 2019 after the abrogation of Article 370.

---

#### **Delhi as a Union Territory:**
1. **Early Status:**
   - Post-Independence, Delhi was a Part C State with an appointed Chief Commissioner.
   - In 1956, Delhi became a Union Territory under the **States Reorganization Act**.

2. **Partial Statehood:**
   - The **Delhi Administration Act, 1966**, provided limited self-governance through the Metropolitan Council and an appointed Chief Executive Councillor.
   - In 1991, the **69th Constitutional Amendment** granted Delhi a legislative assembly and renamed it the **National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi**.
   - The amendment allowed the assembly to legislate on state subjects, except public order, police, and land.

3. **Role of Lieutenant Governor (LG):**
   - The LG represents the Central Government and retains significant powers, particularly in areas excluded from the Delhi Assembly’s jurisdiction.

4. **Recent Developments:**
   - The tussle between the Delhi Government and the LG over administrative control has been a recurring issue.
   - The **Government of NCT of Delhi (Amendment) Act, 2021**, reasserted the LG's primacy in governance, sparking debates on Delhi's autonomy.

# SC to hear tomorrow pleas seeking review of same-sex marriage verdict

### **Same-Sex Marriage in India and the Supreme Court Review Petition**

#### **1. Same-Sex Marriage in India:**
Same-sex marriage refers to the legal recognition of a marriage between two individuals of the same sex. While many countries globally have legalized same-sex unions, the issue remains contentious in India, rooted in socio-cultural and legal complexities.

##### **Key Developments:**
1. **Decriminalization of Homosexuality:**
   - In **2018**, the Supreme Court, in the landmark **Navtej Singh Johar v. Union of India** case, decriminalized homosexuality by reading down Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, a colonial-era law. The judgment upheld the right to privacy, equality, and dignity of LGBTQ+ individuals.

2. **Push for Marriage Equality:**
   - Following decriminalization, LGBTQ+ activists and couples have advocated for the legalization of same-sex marriages to ensure equal rights in family law, inheritance, adoption, and social acceptance.
   - The Indian Constitution guarantees **equality (Article 14)**, **protection from discrimination (Article 15)**, and **the right to life and dignity (Article 21)**, which supporters argue extend to marriage rights.

3. **Opposition:**
   - Critics, including certain religious and cultural groups, argue that marriage is traditionally a union between a man and a woman and that legalizing same-sex marriage would disrupt societal norms.
   - The government, in opposing legalization, has maintained that marriage laws in India cater to heterosexual unions and that same-sex relationships are not equivalent to the concept of family.

---

#### **2. The October 2023 Supreme Court Judgment:**
In October 2023, a five-judge Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court ruled against legalizing same-sex marriage. Key points of the judgment:
- **Recognition of LGBTQ+ Rights:** The Court acknowledged the dignity of LGBTQ+ individuals and their relationships but held that legalizing same-sex marriage required legislative action, not judicial intervention.
- **Role of Parliament:** It emphasized that defining marriage laws is the prerogative of Parliament, reflecting societal values and cultural traditions.
- **Suggestions for Rights:** The Court suggested that the government explore granting certain rights to same-sex couples, such as civil unions or partnership recognition, without equating it to marriage.

---

#### **3. Review Petition:**
Following the October judgment, petitions have been filed seeking a **review** of the decision. A new five-judge Bench led by Justice B.R. Gavai will hear the matter.

##### **What is a Review Petition?**
- A review petition, under **Article 137** of the Constitution, allows the Supreme Court to review its own judgment if there is an apparent error or if new evidence emerges.
- Reviews are limited in scope and rarely overturn original judgments unless compelling reasons are presented.

---

#### **4. Grounds for the Review Petition:**
1. **Violation of Fundamental Rights:**
   - Petitioners argue that denying marriage rights violates **Articles 14, 15, and 21**, which guarantee equality, non-discrimination, and the right to live with dignity.

2. **Judicial Responsibility:**
   - The petitioners contend that the judiciary has a duty to uphold constitutional values and protect marginalized communities when legislative action is absent or slow.

3. **International Precedents:**
   - With over 30 countries legalizing same-sex marriage, petitioners highlight India’s need to align with global human rights standards.

4. **Ambiguity in Rights:**
   - The October judgment’s suggestion for civil unions or partnerships lacks clarity, leaving same-sex couples without any legal recourse for protection in areas like inheritance, adoption, or medical consent.

---

#### **5. Challenges and Implications:**
1. **Cultural Sensitivity:**
   - India’s socio-cultural diversity makes the issue of same-sex marriage deeply sensitive, requiring careful handling to avoid societal backlash.

2. **Legislative Delays:**
   - While the judiciary defers the matter to Parliament, legislative action on such contentious issues is often delayed due to political and societal divisions.

3. **Precedent-Setting:**
