# Why was the no-detention policy rolled back?

The Union government amended the Rules of the **Right to Education Act, 2009** in December 2024 to allow schools to detain students in Classes 5 and 8 if they are unable to meet the promotion criteria after a year-end examination. Students will be given a second chance re-examination after two months of extra teaching. This rollback of the RTE Act’s vision of a **no-detention policy was initially brought through an amendment of the law in 2019**, following which 18 States and UTs have reinstated the option to detain students; the 2024 amendment now extends the option to Central government-run schools too.

### What was the rationale behind the original no-detention policy?

When the RTE Act was passed in 2009, it included **Section 16**, which stipulated that “No child admitted in a school shall be held back in any class or expelled from school till the completion of elementary education [Classes 1 to 8]”. “The spirit of a no-detention policy was to ensure that children can learn without unnecessary pressure. Detention is demoralising to children. There was also an understanding that a single final year-end examination is not the best way to assess learning and decide on their progress,” said Vimala Ramachandran, a former professor at the National Institute of Educational Planning and Administration. “But it was implemented very shoddily. No detention became no testing, and in many schools, no teaching. It was a slippery slope.”

She noted that government schools in many States simply stopped testing in any form until Class 5, automatically promoting children without bothering to find out if they had acquired grade-specific skills and knowledge. Monitoring systems focussed on inputs or maybe indicators, rarely on outcomes.

Efforts to introduce a **Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation (CCE) programme** instead, in coordination with UNICEF, were largely stymied by a lack of resources and training, and teacher apathy. In many schools, NCERT’s CCE forms were simply filled en masse by teachers without an assessment of individual children’s skills. A number of boards abandoned the model of multiple formative and summative assessments, retreating to the familiarity of a final year-end examination.

### Why has it been rolled back?

Surveys conducted by both government and private entities in recent years have documented an alarming learning gap in India’s schools.

The **Annual Status of Education Report (ASER)**, a respected survey spearheaded by the NGO Pratham, found that only 42.8% of Class 5 students could read a Class 2-level text in 2022, a fall from 50.5% in 2018. Only 25.6% of them could do basic arithmetic problems in 2022, a slight drop from 27.9% in 2018.

Even more worryingly, ASER 2023 tested foundational skills in youth aged 14 to 18 years and found that a quarter of them still cannot read a Class 2 level text fluently in their regional language. More than half struggle with division (3-digit by 1-digit) problems, a skill taught in Class 3 and 4.

The Department of School Education’s National Achievement Survey 2021 also showed clear declines as students moved up the school ladder. Out of a maximum 500, Class 3 students scored an average of 323 in language and 306 in Mathematics. By Class 5, the scores dropped to 309 and 284 respectively, and to 302 and 255 by Class 8.

A government analysis of Classes 10 and 12 results across 59 State and national boards in 2023 showed that more than 65 lakh students had failed to clear their examinations, with a failure rate ranging from 12% in national boards to 18% in State boards.

“In the name of promoting all students in the younger classes, we are adversely affecting them in later life,” said Joseph Emmanuel, who was academic director of the Central Board of Secondary Examination (CBSE) till a few months ago, when he took charge of the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE). “There is a clear learning gap that was exacerbated by the COVID disruptions. This [rollback of the no-detention policy] is a good example of evidence-based decision making.”

Dr. Ramachandran said the amendment represents a regression, and instead called for better mechanisms to assess children’s learning and hold teachers accountable.

### What is the way forward?

“Timely remedial action is needed at every stage. There must be regular assessment done at the school level in every class, not at the board level. Who is the best judge of a child’s learning? It is their own teachers. We must trust teachers and equip them,” said Dr. Emmanuel.

He noted that the Rules require the class teacher to “provide specialised inputs after identifying the learning gaps at various stages of assessment” and stipulate that the school Head personally monitor the progress of the children who are held back. “More accountability is being brought in,” he said.

Dr. Ramachandran said the focus of accountability must change. “Instead of detaining and punishing the child for not doing well, we need a way to hold the teacher responsible and accountable,” she said. Too many teachers only focus on the children in the front rows of their classroom, often discriminating against those from lower socio-economic backgrounds who may struggle more and are more likely to be detained. “Rigorous teacher appraisal is needed to ensure inclusive teaching. There must be some consequences for the teacher, not just the student, as well as incentives to ensure this,” she urged.

The **no-detention policy (NDP)** under the **Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009**, which promoted automatic promotion of students up to Class 8, was rolled back in 2019 due to growing concerns over its impact on learning outcomes, accountability, and the overall education system.

---

### **Reasons for Rolling Back the No-Detention Policy**

#### **1. Decline in Learning Outcomes**
- **Poor Academic Standards:**  
  The policy led to students being promoted to higher grades without achieving the required competencies, resulting in significant gaps in foundational learning.
- **National Assessments Highlighted Issues:**  
  Reports like the **Annual Status of Education Report (ASER)** showed declining levels of basic literacy and numeracy skills among students, with many unable to read simple texts or perform basic arithmetic.

#### **2. Lack of Accountability**
- **Reduced Student Effort:**  
  Knowing they would be automatically promoted, many students lacked motivation to study, impacting their performance and engagement in class.
- **Reduced Teacher Responsibility:**  
  Teachers faced fewer incentives to ensure all students met learning benchmarks, as promotion was guaranteed regardless of performance.

#### **3. Psychological Impact on Students**
- **Cumulative Learning Deficit:**  
  Students promoted without understanding earlier concepts struggled in higher grades, leading to frustration and increased dropout rates.
- **False Sense of Progress:**  
  Students and parents were misled into believing progress was being made, while actual learning outcomes were poor.

#### **4. Regional and Expert Opposition**
- **State Feedback:**  
  Many states and stakeholders criticized the policy for being counterproductive, arguing that automatic promotion weakened the rigor and quality of education.
- **Expert Recommendations:**  
  Committees such as the **Subramanian Committee** (2016) recommended discontinuing the policy, citing its negative impact on the quality of education.

#### **5. Increased Dropout Rates in Secondary Education**
- **Transition Struggles:**  
  Students promoted without adequate skills found it difficult to cope in secondary education, leading to higher dropout rates after Class 8.

---

### **Key Features of the Rollback**
- **Reintroduction of Examinations:**  
  Students from Classes 5 and 8 are now required to pass exams to be promoted.  
  - If a student fails, they are given additional opportunities to improve through remedial measures and re-examinations.
- **Focus on Accountability:**  
  Teachers and schools are expected to ensure that all students meet minimum learning standards.

---

### **Way Forward**
1. **Balanced Approach:**  
   Combine regular assessments with remedial measures to support struggling students without discouraging them.
2. **Teacher Training:**  
   Equip teachers with the skills to handle diverse learning needs and ensure all students achieve foundational competencies.
3. **Parental Involvement:**  
   Encourage active participation of parents in monitoring and supporting their child's education.
4. **Continuous Assessments:**  
   Implement formative assessments to identify learning gaps early and address them systematically.

---

### **Conclusion**
The rollback of the no-detention policy reflects a shift toward prioritizing learning outcomes and accountability in education. While the NDP aimed to reduce dropout rates and psychological stress, its unintended consequences highlighted the need for structured evaluations and support systems. A balanced approach that ensures learning progress alongside reduced stress is essential for achieving quality education.

### **Conclusion**
The RTE Act, 2009, is a transformative step in making education accessible and equitable for all children in India. While it has significantly improved enrollment rates, challenges like quality of education, infrastructure, and teacher training remain. Addressing these issues is essential for realizing the full potential of the Act and ensuring inclusive and quality education for all.

> The **No Detention Policy (NDP)**, introduced under the **Right to Education Act, 2009**, mandated automatic promotion of students up to Class 8, aiming to reduce dropout rates and stress among students. However, it faced criticism for declining learning outcomes, as students progressed without achieving basic competencies. Teachers' accountability and students' motivation to learn also decreased. Reports like ASER highlighted poor literacy and numeracy skills, and many states opposed the policy. In 2019, the policy was amended, reintroducing examinations for Classes 5 and 8, with provisions for remedial measures and re-examinations, balancing student welfare with learning accountability and quality education.

# Is India’s forest cover growing enough?

The State of Forest Report (SFR), 2023 was released by Union Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav at the Forest Research Institute, Dehradun, on December 21, 2024. The SFR is a biennial exercise the Government of India undertakes to track tree and forest cover, carbon stock, forest fires, and other parameters related to the country’s green cover.

### What did SFR, 2023 find?

According to SFR, 2023, **25.17%** of India’s area is under forest and tree cover. Of this, forests cover 21.76% of land and trees 3.41%. These figures represent marginal increases from 21.71% and 2.91%, respectively, as reported in SFR, 2021. In absolute terms, the increase is 1,445 sq. km. **The National Forest Policy, 1988**, which governs green cover in India, requires 33% of the country’s geographical area to be under tree or forest cover. **Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh, and Odisha** led the list of States that increased forest and tree cover while Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Ladakh (Union Territory), and Nagaland were the top four where forest and tree cover has dropped.

### What is green cover?

Forest cover in India means an area of a hectare or more **“with a tree canopy of more than or equal to 10%, irrespective of ownership and legal status,”** per the report. Likewise, tree cover refers to all tree patches that exist outside of forest area and which occupy **“less than one hectare in extent, including all the scattered trees found in the rural and urban settings, and [are] not captured under the forest cover assessment”**.

The SFR uses a mix of **satellite data and details from the National Forest Inventory**, plus ground-truthing to verify the information. Forest cover estimates come from satellite data and growing and carbon stock estimates from the Inventory. The 2023 report uses satellite data from October to December 2021 and NFI data from 2017 to 2022.

### How have sensitive areas fared?

In 2014, the Union government first notified the Western Ghats Eco-Sensitive Area (WGESA) along the country’s west coast under the Environment Protection Act, 1986 for special protection. According to SFR, 2023, the Western Ghats Area has lost 58.22 sq. km of forest cover in the last decade. While the **cover of “very dense” forests increased**, those of **“moderately dense” and “open” forests fell**. “Very dense” forests have a canopy density of at least 70%, “moderately dense” forests of 40-70%, and “open” forests of 10-40%.

The **Nilgiris forests are part of the WGESA and a UNESCO biosphere. Between 2013 and 2023, they lost 123.44 sq. km** of forest cover. Nilgiris district reported a fourfold increase in the number of forest fires from 2022-23 to 2023-2024.

Mangroves — tropical trees in the intertidal zones of coastal areas — are withdrawing as well. The report has estimated **0.15%** of India’s total geographical area as under mangrove cover following an **overall decrease of 7.43 sq. km from 2021 alone**. Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra increased their State-wise share but **Gujarat’s Kutch area reported a significant decrease**. These trees stabilise coastlines, mitigate erosion, encourage biodiversity, shield coastal communities from sea-level rise, and temper the fury of cyclones.

The **northeast occupies less than 8% of India’s total land area but more than 21% of its tree and forest cover**. Per SFR 2023, **tree and forest cover in the region shrunk by 327.3 sq. km**. There have been reports in the press that at least part of the decline is due to conversion of forests for agricultural use.

### What is the SFR’s applicability?

While the definitions are straightforward, what they include or exclude has prompted concerns. For example, as trees became popular as a ‘solution’ for climate mitigation because of their ability to sequester carbon, many lawmakers as well as researchers began to tout tree-planting as a blanket fix.

In due course, two important problems emerged with this idea. **First**, not all ecosystems are suited for trees, and damaging them by planting trees could have repercussions that negate the original purpose of the exercise. **Second**, only native and mature species in the right environments can sequester carbon efficiently. Young trees or those unsuitable for their environs either wouldn’t help as much or not at all. One direct analogue in the SFRs is that the definition of forests includes “orchards, bamboo, and palm”. Divya Gupta, assistant professor of environmental studies and sustainable communities at the State University of New York, thus called the report’s marquee finding a “celebratory statistic”. “By including plantations, orchards, palms, and non-native ecosystems, it erases the distinction between natural forests and monocultures,” she added. “This aggregation misrepresents forest health, obscures deforestation and degradation, and offers a distorted view of what we should truly prioritise.”

“The share of actual increase in forest cover appears to be very minimal … compared to the 1,445 sq. km of forest and green cover increase claimed in the document,” Sudeep Budhaditya Deb, deputy conservator of forests at the Office of the Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (North Bengal), said.

### Is SFR related to climate action?

Exercises to understand how much carbon can be sequestered use the term carbon stock to denote all the carbon held in living and non-living biomass in an ecosystem. In a mature forest, for example, the carbon collects in the trees as they grow both aboveground and below, in the leaf litter surrounding the trees, in the deadwood, etc.

In 2022, India committed to increase its carbon stock by 2.5-3 billion tonnes “through additional forest and tree cover by 2030”. The current stock of this variety is around 30.4 billion tonnes. According to SFR 2023, **India increased its carbon stock by 81.5 million tonnes** and the growing stock — the sum (by number or volume) of all the trees living/growing in forests — by 4.25% between 2021 and 2023.

But experts have said the report doesn’t say anything about the quality of forests contributing to increases in forest cover nor provides data on the actual causes of forest degradation. “Key ecological indicators such as forest fragmentation and biodiversity health are missing, making it impossible to evaluate the true significance of the statistics reported,” Ms. Gupta said. “Moreover, the report lacks mechanisms to track ecosystem losses caused by land-use changes and deforestation.”

> The **India State of Forest Report (ISFR) 2023** indicates a modest increase in India's forest and tree cover, now accounting for **25.17%** of the country's area, up by **1,445 sq km** since 2021. However, it falls short of the **33% target** set by the National Forest Policy. Concerns persist about the quality of this growth, as it includes plantations and urban greenery, which lack the ecological benefits of natural forests. Critics have also questioned the Forest Survey of India’s methodology, suggesting inflated data. Achieving sustainable forest growth requires expanding natural forests while prioritizing biodiversity and ecological restoration efforts.

# Why is rupee weakening against dollar?

In the last week of December, 2024, the rupee breached the 85 mark against the U.S. dollar, touching an all-time low of **85.81**. The currency depreciated about 3% in 2024, continuing its long-term trend of gradually but consistently losing value against the dollar.

### What causes a currency to depreciate?

The price of any currency in the foreign exchange market is determined by the demand for the currency vis-a-vis its supply. This is similar to how the price of any other product is determined in the marketplace. When the demand for a product rises while its supply remains constant, this causes the price of the product to rise in order to ration the available supply. On the other hand, when the demand for a product drops while its supply remains constant, this causes sellers to drop the price of the product in order to attract sufficient buyers.

The only difference between the goods market and the forex market is that currencies are exchanged for other currencies rather than for goods in the foreign exchange market.

A currency depreciates against a foreign currency when the demand for it (in terms of the foreign currency) drops compared to its available supply in the market. When the currency’s value depreciates, the value of the foreign currency automatically appreciates on the other side. This is similar to how the purchasing power of your money depreciates or appreciates when the price of goods in the marketplace rise or fall, respectively.

There are various factors that determine the demand for and the supply of any currency in the foreign exchange market.

One of the most important determinants of the supply of a currency in the market is the monetary policy of a country’s central bank. A central bank adopting looser monetary policy compared with other central banks will cause the supply of its currency in the market (for both goods trade and investment purposes) to rise relative to other currencies, causing the currency’s value to drop. Central banks adopting relatively tighter monetary policy, on the other hand, are likely to see their currencies appreciate in value.

A crucial factor that determines the demand for any currency, on the other hand, is the demand among foreigners for the goods and assets of the country. Since foreigners will first have to purchase the local currency before they can purchase a country’s goods and assets, high demand for a country’s goods and assets translates to high demand for its currency and which in turn leads to a rise in the value of the currency. A fall in demand for a country’s goods or assets, on the other hand, will cause the value of its currency to fall.

### What is behind the rupee’s fall?

The current bout of rupee depreciation is seen as driven primarily by the exit of foreign investors from India, which has put pressure on the rupee.

Global investors have been shuffling their investments across countries as central banks recalibrate their monetary policies to varying degrees. High inflation in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic led to monetary tightening by central banks which is now being reversed as inflation comes more under control. This has pushed investors to withdraw money from markets like India and invest in more advanced markets.

Meanwhile, the longer term trend of the rupee’s depreciation against the dollar is attributed to higher inflation in India than in the U.S. due to the Reserve Bank of India’s looser monetary policy compared to the U.S. Federal Reserve. India’s traditional demand for high-value imports such as crude oil and gold (which boosts demand for the dollar and weakens the rupee) to keep its economy going and its inability to boost exports (which can help boost demand for the rupee) have also contributed to the lackluster performance of the rupee. The RBI has been using its dollar reserves to prop up the value of the rupee by artificially increasing the supply of dollars in the foreign exchange market, and thus the dollar demand for rupees.

As a result, the value of India’s foreign exchange reserves dropped to an eight-month low of $640 billion as of the last week of December from over $700 billion in September.

Analysts believe the rupee’s depreciation would have been far worse if not for the RBI’s intervention to support the rupee against the dollar.

The RBI’s traditional stance has been to manage the rupee’s exchange value in such a way as to allow for a gradual depreciation in its value without too much volatility that could disrupt the economy.

The weakening of the **rupee against the dollar** is a complex phenomenon influenced by various **domestic and international factors**. The exchange rate between currencies is determined by market forces, such as supply and demand, and is influenced by economic conditions, investor sentiment, and government policies. Here are the key reasons why the rupee may weaken against the dollar:

---

### **1. Global Factors**
#### **a. Strengthening of the U.S. Dollar**
- The U.S. dollar is often seen as a "safe haven" during global economic or geopolitical uncertainty. This increases demand for the dollar and puts pressure on other currencies, including the rupee.
- A strong U.S. economy, rising interest rates, or hawkish monetary policy by the **Federal Reserve** attract foreign investors to dollar-denominated assets, increasing the demand for dollars.

#### **b. Rising Crude Oil Prices**
- India is a major importer of crude oil, and higher oil prices increase the demand for dollars to pay for imports, widening the **current account deficit (CAD)** and weakening the rupee.

#### **c. Global Trade Imbalances**
- Trade wars, supply chain disruptions, or geopolitical tensions can disrupt global trade flows, impacting India’s exports and increasing pressure on the rupee.

#### **d. Geopolitical Uncertainty**
- Events like the Russia-Ukraine war, tensions in the Middle East, or economic instability in major economies lead to volatility in currency markets and capital flight toward the U.S. dollar.

---

### **2. Domestic Factors**
#### **a. Current Account Deficit (CAD)**
- A growing CAD due to higher imports (especially crude oil, gold, and electronics) compared to exports leads to a greater outflow of dollars than inflow, weakening the rupee.

#### **b. Inflation**
- High inflation reduces the purchasing power of the rupee, making it less attractive to foreign investors.

#### **c. Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI) Outflows**
- Rising interest rates in the U.S. or global uncertainty often cause foreign investors to withdraw investments from Indian markets, leading to capital outflows and increasing demand for dollars.

#### **d. Sluggish Export Growth**
- If Indian exports do not grow at a pace sufficient to offset rising imports, the trade deficit widens, putting downward pressure on the rupee.

#### **e. Weak Domestic Growth**
- Slower economic growth or concerns over fiscal discipline can erode investor confidence in the rupee.

#### **f. Policy Divergences**
- If the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) keeps interest rates low while the U.S. Federal Reserve hikes rates, the interest rate differential makes the rupee less attractive to investors.

---

### **3. Speculation and Market Sentiment**
- **Speculation:** Traders in the foreign exchange market betting against the rupee can cause it to weaken further.
- **Sentiment:** Negative news about India’s economic outlook or policy decisions can reduce investor confidence, leading to a weaker rupee.

---

### **4. Government Debt and Reserves**
- India’s **external debt** denominated in dollars increases demand for the dollar when repayments are due.
- A decline in India’s **foreign exchange reserves** reduces the RBI's ability to stabilize the rupee.

---

### **Implications of a Weak Rupee**
1. **Increased Import Costs:**  
   - Higher prices for crude oil, machinery, and raw materials increase production costs and domestic inflation.
2. **Export Competitiveness:**  
   - A weaker rupee can benefit exporters as Indian goods become cheaper in global markets, but this depends on global demand and trade policies.
3. **Impact on Borrowing Costs:**  
   - Indian firms with dollar-denominated debt face higher repayment costs, affecting profitability.
4. **Foreign Travel and Education:**  
   - Expenses for Indians traveling or studying abroad increase significantly.

---

### **What Can Be Done to Stabilize the Rupee?**
1. **RBI Intervention:**  
   - The RBI can sell dollars from its forex reserves to reduce volatility, but this is a short-term measure.
2. **Boost Exports:**  
   - Policies to promote exports and reduce dependence on imports can narrow the trade deficit.
3. **Control Inflation:**  
   - Maintaining low inflation strengthens investor confidence in the rupee.
4. **Attract FDI and FPI:**  
   - Reforms to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) and portfolio investment (FPI) can increase dollar inflows.
5. **Energy Alternatives:**  
   - Reducing reliance on imported oil through renewable energy initiatives can decrease dollar demand.

---

### **Conclusion**
The rupee's weakening against the dollar is a reflection of both external pressures and domestic vulnerabilities. While some factors, like global economic trends, are beyond India’s control, steps like reducing the trade deficit, stabilizing inflation, and promoting economic growth can help bolster the rupee in the long run.

> The weakening of the rupee against the dollar is driven by global and domestic factors. Globally, a strong U.S. dollar, rising crude oil prices, and geopolitical uncertainties increase dollar demand. Domestically, a growing current account deficit, inflation, and foreign investment outflows exert downward pressure on the rupee. Speculative trading and weak export growth also contribute. A weaker rupee raises import costs, impacts inflation, and increases foreign debt repayment burdens but can boost export competitiveness. To stabilize the rupee, measures like boosting exports, reducing import dependency, attracting foreign investments, and controlling inflation are essential, alongside short-term RBI interventions in forex markets.

# Karnataka among 10 States that saw lowest NOTA votes

### **NOTA in Indian Elections: Context and Evolution**

**1. Position of NOTA in Indian Elections**  
- **Introduction:**  
  The "None of the Above" (NOTA) option was introduced in Indian elections by the Supreme Court ruling in 2013 in the *People’s Union for Civil Liberties v. Union of India* case. It allows voters to express dissent by rejecting all candidates on the ballot.

- **Symbolism:**  
  - NOTA serves as a symbolic tool, providing a platform for expressing dissatisfaction with the candidates without abstaining from voting.
  - It neither impacts the election results directly nor invalidates the election of the candidate with the highest votes, even if NOTA secures the majority.

---

**2. Evolution of NOTA in India**  
- **Pre-2013:**  
  Before NOTA, voters dissatisfied with candidates had to refrain from voting or use the *Section 49-O* provision of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961, which required voters to reveal their identity to reject all candidates, thereby breaching voter confidentiality.

- **Post-2013:**  
  - Following the Supreme Court’s judgment, the Election Commission of India introduced NOTA as an option on Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) in 2014.
  - Over time, NOTA has been used in Lok Sabha, Assembly, and local body elections.

---

**3. Global Practices: NOTA or Similar Provisions in Other Nations**
- **Countries with NOTA-like Options:**  
  - **Russia:** Voters could select "Against All" until 2006 (abolished due to misuse concerns).  
  - **Spain:** Blank votes indicate dissatisfaction, influencing the proportionality of seats.  
  - **Ukraine and Colombia:** Voters can formally reject all candidates.  
  - **USA:** Certain states like Nevada offer "None of These Candidates" in ballots.

- **Impact Abroad:**  
  In some countries, a majority NOTA/blank vote requires the election to be re-conducted or forces political parties to reconsider candidate selections.

---

### **Current Shape of NOTA in India**

**1. Weaknesses:**
- **Lack of Impact:**  
  NOTA does not influence the outcome of elections, even if it garners the majority of votes. The next-highest vote-getter wins the seat, rendering it largely symbolic.
  
- **Lack of Awareness:**  
  Many voters are unaware of the existence or significance of NOTA, limiting its potential as a tool for dissent.

- **No Consequences for Parties or Candidates:**  
  A high NOTA count does not lead to re-elections or candidate disqualification, reducing its deterrent effect on political parties fielding poor candidates.

**2. Strengths:**  
- NOTA provides a legitimate mechanism for voters to express their dissatisfaction while maintaining voter confidentiality and increasing voter turnout.

---

### **Steps to Strengthen NOTA and Uphold Democratic Principles**

1. **Make NOTA Impactful:**  
   - If NOTA receives the majority of votes, the election in that constituency should be re-conducted with fresh candidates.
   - Parties should be mandated to field new candidates in re-conducted elections.

2. **Enhance Voter Awareness:**  
   - Nationwide campaigns by the Election Commission to educate voters on the existence and significance of NOTA.  
   - Include information on NOTA in voter literacy programs.

3. **Candidate Accountability:**  
   - Political parties should be held accountable if NOTA garners a significant share of votes, encouraging them to field credible candidates.

4. **Introduce Reforms for Local Elections:**  
   - Pilot reforms where a majority NOTA vote triggers a re-election at the local body level to assess feasibility.

5. **Encourage Policy Advocacy:**  
   - Civil society groups and think tanks should push for legislative amendments to make NOTA a more robust tool for electoral accountability.

---

### **Conclusion**

NOTA, while a significant democratic reform, remains a symbolic tool in India, with limited direct consequences on election results. Strengthening its impact can transform it into a meaningful instrument of accountability, compelling political parties to field deserving candidates. To uphold democratic principles, reforms making NOTA consequential, coupled with voter education and awareness campaigns, are necessary. By doing so, India can foster greater political accountability and ensure that elections truly reflect the people's will.

> NOTA percentage in State in LS polls is 0.56, the seventh lowest in the country, according to EC. NOTA (None of the Above) was introduced in Indian elections in 2013 as a tool for voters to reject all candidates without abstaining from voting. However, it remains largely symbolic, as it does not affect election outcomes; the candidate with the highest votes still wins, even if NOTA garners a majority. Globally, countries like Colombia and Ukraine give more weight to similar options, sometimes triggering re-elections. In India, NOTA's impact is limited by voter unawareness and lack of consequences for political parties. To strengthen NOTA, reforms like re-elections upon majority NOTA votes, enhanced voter awareness, and candidate accountability are necessary.

# New Governor suggests use of NSA in Manipur

### **The National Security Act (NSA), 1980**

The **National Security Act (NSA), 1980** is a preventive detention law enacted by the Indian Parliament to ensure the security of the nation, maintain public order, and prevent threats to the country's sovereignty and integrity. It empowers the central and state governments to detain individuals who pose a risk to national security, disrupt public order, or are involved in activities prejudicial to India’s relations with foreign countries.

1. **Preventive Detention:**  
   - Individuals can be detained without formal charges for a period of up to **12 months**.  
   - Detention can be extended further upon periodic reviews.  
   - In specific cases, individuals can be detained for up to **three months without approval from an Advisory Board**.

2. **Non-Bailable and Non-Judicial Nature:**  
   - Detained individuals do not have the right to bail or legal representation during the detention period.

4. **Applicability:**  
   - The Act applies across India and covers a broad spectrum of threats, including terrorism, espionage, and activities undermining public order.

---

### **Context in Manipur**
Manipur, plagued by ethnic violence, insurgency, and communal unrest, faces challenges that threaten public order and national security. The Governor's suggestion to invoke the NSA indicates a focus on managing escalating tensions and ensuring stability in the region.

---

### **How NSA Can Help in Ensuring National Security**
1. **Deterrence Against Insurgents and Extremists:**  
   - The NSA allows authorities to pre-emptively detain individuals suspected of fueling violence or engaging in insurgent activities.

2. **Control of Misinformation and Propaganda:**  
   - The Act can be used to detain those spreading rumors, hate speech, or inciting communal violence, which is critical in a volatile region like Manipur.

3. **Ensuring Public Safety:**  
   - By removing individuals threatening peace, the NSA can help restore order and provide a safer environment for residents.

4. **Support to Law Enforcement:**  
   - Security forces gain additional powers to act decisively against potential threats without the delay of legal proceedings.

5. **Focus on Strategic Targets:**  
   - High-risk individuals who evade traditional prosecution due to lack of evidence can be detained under the NSA, disrupting organized threats.

---

### **Criticism and Safeguards**
- **Criticism:**  
   - The NSA is often criticized for potential misuse, including arbitrary detentions and suppression of dissent.  
   - Lack of transparency in detention grounds can raise human rights concerns.  
- **Safeguards:**  
   - Periodic review by an Advisory Board ensures that detentions are not arbitrary.  
   - Judicial oversight, though limited, provides some checks on misuse.

---

### **Conclusion**
The NSA, 1980, is a powerful legal tool to address threats to national security and public order, particularly in sensitive areas like Manipur. While its implementation must be cautious to avoid misuse, the NSA's preventive detention provisions can play a critical role in stabilizing volatile situations and safeguarding the nation's integrity.

> A day after assuming charge, Manipur Governor Ajay Kumar Bhalla held a security review meeting on Saturday and suggested that the State police use legal options such as the National Security Act, 1980, which allows detention for a year without trial, against miscreants and troublemakers, Mr. Bhalla discussed employment opportunities for the “misguided” youth, and asked the security agencies to prepare dossiers on key suspects who were fuelling violence and initiate action against them. The Central Reserve Police Force and the Border Security Force flagged the violation of ceasefire ground rules by the Pambei faction of the United National Liberation Front (UNLF), the oldest armed Meitei insurgent group, which signed a peace agreement with the Union Home Ministry and Manipur government on November 29, 2023.

# Good girl syndrome: How Women are Programmed to Fail in a Man's World

**Good Girl Syndrome: An Exploration of Gender Expectations and Societal Norms**

**Introduction**  
"Good Girl Syndrome" is a term that reflects the societal expectations placed on women to conform to predefined norms of behavior, appearance, and morality. Rooted in patriarchal traditions, this syndrome manifests in the pressure women feel to be agreeable, submissive, nurturing, and self-sacrificing. While the idea of being "good" may seem positive, it often enforces rigid stereotypes that limit personal freedom and individuality.

This essay explores the origins, implications, and potential ways to address "Good Girl Syndrome," highlighting its impact on the psychological, social, and professional spheres of women's lives.

---

**Origins of Good Girl Syndrome**  
The concept of being a "good girl" is deeply embedded in cultural, religious, and historical contexts. For centuries, women have been assigned roles as caretakers, moral guardians, and bearers of cultural traditions. These expectations have been perpetuated through family upbringing, educational systems, and media representations.  
- **Cultural Factors:** Societies across the globe have praised women for being obedient, modest, and self-effacing, discouraging traits like assertiveness or ambition in women.  
- **Religious Influence:** Many religious teachings emphasize the ideal woman as self-sacrificing and devoted to family, reinforcing the "good girl" archetype.  
- **Media Stereotypes:** Popular culture frequently portrays women in dichotomous roles – the virtuous "good girl" versus the rebellious "bad girl," often glorifying the former while vilifying the latter.

---

**Psychological Impact**  
The pressure to conform to these ideals can take a significant toll on a woman's mental health.  
- **Low Self-Esteem:** Women who feel they cannot meet these expectations may struggle with feelings of inadequacy.  
- **Guilt and Anxiety:** The inability to assert themselves often leads to feelings of guilt, especially when prioritizing personal needs over societal demands.  
- **Burnout:** Constantly striving to please others and meet societal standards can result in emotional and physical exhaustion.

---

**Social Implications**  
"Good Girl Syndrome" influences the dynamics of relationships, workplaces, and communities.  
- **In Relationships:** Women may feel compelled to suppress their opinions or desires to maintain harmony, leading to imbalanced partnerships.  
- **In the Workplace:** Gendered expectations can discourage women from negotiating for better pay or seeking leadership roles, perpetuating gender inequality.  
- **In Society:** The reinforcement of these norms hinders the broader goal of achieving gender equality, as it limits women's participation in decision-making and leadership.

---

**Breaking Free from Good Girl Syndrome**  
Addressing "Good Girl Syndrome" requires a multifaceted approach involving individuals, families, and societies.  
- **Encouraging Self-Awareness:** Women must recognize the internalized biases that influence their behavior and challenge them actively.  
- **Reforming Education:** Schools should promote gender-neutral values, encouraging girls to express themselves freely and pursue diverse interests.  
- **Media Representation:** Portrayals of strong, independent, and diverse female characters in media can inspire women to break away from traditional stereotypes.  
- **Family Support:** Families play a pivotal role in shaping attitudes. Encouraging girls to prioritize their needs and ambitions can help dismantle "good girl" expectations.

---

**Conclusion**  
"Good Girl Syndrome" is a reflection of the broader societal norms that constrain women's roles and potential. While being good is inherently valuable, it should not come at the cost of individuality, ambition, or self-expression. Societies must evolve to celebrate women for their diverse capabilities and choices, fostering an environment where every individual, regardless of gender, can thrive on their terms. By challenging traditional norms and embracing inclusivity, we can create a future where the concept of being "good" is not defined by outdated stereotypes but by authenticity and empowerment.
