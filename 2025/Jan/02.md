# The sorry state of India’s parliamentary proceedings

India, the world’s largest democracy, prides itself on a robust parliamentary system that serves as the cornerstone of its democratic framework. However, in recent years, the functioning of the Indian Parliament has raised serious concerns about its effectiveness, transparency, and accountability. The very institution meant to uphold democratic values and ensure checks and balances on the executive has been increasingly undermined due to several structural and behavioral issues.

### **Declining Parliamentary Productivity**

One of the most glaring issues is the steady decline in parliamentary productivity. Data reveals that the number of sittings and the time devoted to legislative debates have significantly reduced over the years. In contrast to the earlier decades when Parliament used to function for over 100 days annually, recent sessions have been curtailed, sometimes lasting only a few weeks. Critical bills are rushed through without proper debate, often passed within minutes, leaving little room for scrutiny or discussion. This undermines the Parliament’s fundamental role of deliberating on laws that impact millions.

### **Frequent Disruptions and Disorderly Conduct**

Parliamentary disruptions have become a routine occurrence, causing substantial loss of productive hours. Walkouts, slogan-shouting, and adjournments due to protests over various issues result in stalled proceedings. The absence of meaningful debate leads to the bypassing of important discussions on policies, budgets, and bills. Often, political rivalry takes precedence over constructive dialogue, eroding the institution’s dignity and effectiveness.

### **Rise in Ordinances and Bypassing Debates**

The increasing use of ordinances by the government to enact laws reflects the Parliament’s weakening authority. Ordinances, meant for emergency situations, are now frequently used to bypass parliamentary debate. Additionally, the trend of passing important bills as Money Bills—thereby avoiding Rajya Sabha scrutiny—undermines the bicameral structure and dilutes checks and balances. This practice limits opposition participation and reduces parliamentary oversight.

### **Lack of Accountability and Oversight**

Parliament’s role in holding the executive accountable has weakened. The Question Hour, traditionally a powerful tool for scrutinizing the government, is either suspended or inadequately utilized. Parliamentary committees, responsible for detailed examination of bills and government functioning, are underutilized, with fewer bills being referred to them for scrutiny. This hampers comprehensive evaluation of proposed legislation and diminishes transparency.

### **Deterioration of Parliamentary Ethics**

Instances of unparliamentary behavior, personal attacks, and derogatory remarks have become more common, tarnishing the institution's image. The absence of decorum and respect for parliamentary procedures undermines healthy democratic debate. Moreover, the criminalization of politics, with several MPs facing serious criminal charges, raises ethical concerns about the representatives themselves.

### **Media and Public Disengagement**

Media coverage often focuses on sensational disruptions rather than substantial debates, leading to public disengagement from the legislative process. The lack of transparency in the internal functioning of parliamentary committees and the limited dissemination of parliamentary discussions restrict public awareness and involvement.

### **Conclusion**

The Indian Parliament is pivotal to the functioning of the country’s democracy. However, frequent disruptions, reduced debates, legislative bypassing, and declining accountability have severely impacted its role. Restoring the Parliament’s effectiveness requires reforms such as ensuring adequate sittings, strengthening parliamentary committees, enforcing disciplinary measures, and fostering a culture of constructive debate. Upholding parliamentary integrity is essential for maintaining public trust and safeguarding the democratic ethos of the nation.

> India's parliamentary proceedings have been declining due to reduced productivity, frequent disruptions, and weakened accountability.

Parliamentary disruptions, disorderly conduct, and underutilized committees hinder meaningful discussions. Ethical concerns arise from unruly behavior and the presence of MPs with criminal charges. Media focus on sensationalism over substance further disengages the public. To restore parliamentary effectiveness, reforms are needed to ensure regular sittings, strengthen committees, enforce discipline, and promote constructive debate, safeguarding India's democratic integrity.

# Tackling delimitation by reversing population control

Recently, the Chief Ministers of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, N. Chandrababu Naidu and M.K. Stalin, respectively, were quite peeved about the question of the proposed delimitation exercise and the possibility, subsequently, of the loss of parliamentary seats. This is very likely as the two States, along with the other southern States, are ahead of the rest of India in terms of fertility transition — implying a reduced share of the population when compared with the northern region. What is galling to people in general, and not necessarily just the politicians in south India, is that success in “family planning” will surely reduce the number of seats of the less populated States in Parliament.

“The state government [Andhra Pradesh] is thinking of enacting a law that would make only those with more than two children eligible to contest local body elections,” Mr. Naidu had said. Earlier, Andhra Pradesh had passed a piece of legislation barring people with more than two children from contesting local polls. Mr. Naidu said, “We have repealed that law, and we are now considering reversing it.... Government may provide more benefits to families with more children.”

Mr. Stalin’s response was, “Today, as there is a scenario of decreasing Lok Sabha constituencies, it raises the question why should we restrict ourselves to having fewer children?” Mr. Stalin added in jest, “Why not aim for 16 children?”

### The example of China

The question that arises in the light of the reactions and the responses of the Chief Ministers is: would it be possible to arrest fertility decline and, moreover, reverse it by attempting to increase it? It is evident that the attainment of low fertility in the course of fertility transition is hardly reversible by intervention, but in the natural course of events, there might be a minor reversal as suggested by experience worldwide. Despite this understanding, there are attempts being made in some countries to reverse the fertility trend through incentivisation, but to no effect. China’s one-child policy was one of the desperate measures to realise population control. The consequences confronting the Chinese state on varied fronts include problems in the marriage market, a dependency burden and, above all, extreme low fertility beyond the scope for reversal.

Quick and forced regulatory measures to restrict reproduction have never paid dividends beyond restricting population counts. In fact, an emphasis on limiting population counts without caring for its composition that sustains the population may well be considered unplanned. China’s case is an example wherein the state is facing numerous crises at this point over the familial transitions underway and the consequential burden of social security provisioning on the state.

An imbalanced population composition reached by intruding into the natural course of transition will pose problems that would only be remedied through promoting migration. Efforts at incentivising reproduction and adoption of a pro-natal population policy may not be an alternative as seen in countries such as Japan and South Korea. Hence, the response of the southern States to the emerging threat may well be considered premature and ineffective in the long run.

### Varied population counts

The course of fertility decline in India’s States does show signs of a convergence across space and characteristics but a population momentum keeps the demographic divide wider between regions. Given this circumstance, population counts between provinces may not be the appropriate criterion to have political representation that will defy the federal structure of our nation. ‘One person one vote’ may well be ideal but the difference in numbers of political representation in one region will be skewed beyond proportions. Unless these counts are weighed with some characteristics in terms of appropriating political representation, it will be unfair, for example, to a region that ushered in development with population control. This brings in a recognition of demographic divide apparent with education, coupled with the number of children being the criteria for shaping political outcomes.

### Impact on women

Encouraging women to have more children may be easier said than done. In the current circumstances, a woman’s personal loss in engaging in reproduction is much greater than imagined given the state’s approach in facilitating the same. When the state celebrates the fertility decline and its dividend has benefited the larger cause, its implication in a woman’s life has been less than expected. Therefore, thinking about fertility reversal needs to be preceded by measures of guaranteeing the state’s social support for the additional children on the one hand and compensation for women’s engagement in reproduction on the other.

Reversing fertility could well be ideal in terms of maintaining a sustainable population but the regional population imbalance can perhaps be addressed through migration in immediate terms. What needs to be answered is the ensuing disadvantage of a lower population count and political representation that can only be resolved provided the count gets an equivalence in valuation in terms of capability characteristics. Therefore, the ultimate solution lies not in reversing fertility but in revising count-based political representation in the delimitation exercise.

> Reversing population control to tackle delimitation involves addressing the imbalance in political representation caused by differing population growth rates across states. States that effectively implemented population control, mainly in southern India, risk losing parliamentary seats to northern states with higher population growth. This creates disparities in resource allocation and political influence. To ensure fair representation, solutions could include freezing seat redistribution, adjusting delimitation criteria beyond population, or rewarding states for successful population management. A balanced approach is essential to uphold federal equity while maintaining democratic representation across diverse regions.

# Youth at the forefront of climate litigation

Youth-led climate litigation is revolutionising the global response to the climate crisis. By holding governments and corporations accountable, young people frame climate inaction as a human rights violation. They argue that the disproportionate impacts on younger generations demand bold, systemic solutions. This litigation emphasises the urgent need for climate action, pushing for transformative change to address the escalating emergency. It serves as a powerful tool for advocating for climate justice and protecting the rights of future generations.

### Major milestones

A landmark moment in youth-led climate litigation occurred with the Held v. State of Montana case in the U.S. In a historic decision, the Montana Supreme Court upheld a district court ruling in favour of 16 young plaintiffs who argued that Montana’s fossil fuel policies violated their constitutional rights and failed to address the climate crisis. This 6-1 decision marked the first time a U.S. State Supreme Court affirmed young people’s constitutional right to a clean and healthful environment in the context of climate change. The roots of the case trace back to August 2023, when district court judge Kathy Seeley ruled in favour of the plaintiffs, making Held v. Montana the first youth-led constitutional climate lawsuit in the U.S. to go to trial and secure a victory.

Judge Seeley underscored the direct link between greenhouse gas emissions and the worsening climate crisis, emphasising that each ton of emissions amplifies environmental harm. Her ruling broadened Montana’s constitutional right to a clean and healthful environment by including the protection of the broader climate system. The Supreme Court upheld her findings, striking down laws restricting greenhouse gas considerations in fossil fuel permitting and blocking constitutional remedies for environmental harm. This decision mandates Montana to integrate climate and public health concerns into its energy policies, marking a governance shift. It underscores intergenerational equity and inspires youth-led efforts to shape climate policy.

Youth-led climate litigation is gaining traction globally. In Canada, La Rose v. His Majesty King case represents a significant step forward. In this lawsuit, young plaintiffs argue that Canada’s insufficient climate policies violate their rights to life, liberty, and security under Section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Canadian federal government recently announced it would not seek to dismiss the case, paving the way for an eight-week trial scheduled for October 2026 in Vancouver. The plaintiffs contend that current policies disproportionately harm children and youth. They advocate for a mandate requiring the government to implement a comprehensive, science-aligned climate recovery plan.

In the Netherlands, a court ruling compelled the government to adopt stricter emissions targets. Colombia’s Supreme Court recognised the Amazon rainforest as a legal entity, mandating its protection for future generations. Germany’s Constitutional Court required stronger climate policies to uphold youth rights.

India has seen its share of youth-driven climate litigation, most notably through a petition filed in March 2017 by nine-year-old Ridhima Pandey before the National Green Tribunal (NGT). Her petition sought measures including integrating climate change into environmental impact assessments, establishing a national greenhouse gas inventory, and creating carbon budgets for development projects.

In 2019, the NGT dismissed her case. However, her appeal to the Supreme Court is pending, with the court appointing amicus curiae and requesting government inputs on carbon rules. Ms. Pandey’s efforts have profoundly influenced India’s climate discourse, showcasing the youth’s role in demanding stronger policies and intergenerational equity.

### Transformative implications

Youth-driven legal battles are transforming climate policy, evolving from awareness campaigns led by figures like Greta Thunberg to courtroom advocacy demanding systemic change. These lawsuits emphasise the intersection of human rights and environmental sustainability, inspiring global movements and compelling governments to rethink inadequate climate strategies.

In India, the path to youth climate activism is complex, with increasing crackdowns on protests and shrinking spaces for public engagement. Despite this, youth groups persist, using digital platforms and aligning with movements led by farmers and tribal communities. This resilience underscores their commitment. As young activists challenge policies in courts, the outcomes of cases could shape the future of climate activism in India. Protecting their advocacy rights is crucial to amplifying their voices and achieving climate justice.

Youth-driven climate litigation is revolutionising the global climate movement, achieving landmark wins, and demanding government accountability. By stressing intergenerational equity and science-based policies, young activists push governments to prioritise bold and sustainable actions. These legal efforts underscore the crucial role of youth in shaping climate policy and safeguarding the planet’s future. By leveraging the law, young people are driving transformative change, ensuring a liveable world for generations to come, and inspiring a new wave of climate leadership and activism.

> Youth worldwide are increasingly leading climate litigation efforts, holding governments and corporations accountable for environmental harm and inaction on climate change. Empowered by growing climate awareness and legal frameworks recognizing environmental rights, young activists are filing lawsuits to demand stronger climate policies, emission reductions, and protection of future generations. Landmark cases in countries like the U.S., Germany, and the Netherlands highlight youth-driven legal action influencing climate policy. This movement underscores the urgency of climate justice and amplifies the voices of younger generations, who face the most significant long-term impacts of the climate crisis.

# Four UN environmental summits fell short in 2024. What happened?

The United Nations’ efforts to address critical environmental challenges hit multiple roadblocks this year, with four key summits — in **Colombia on biodiversity, Azerbaijan on climate, Saudi Arabia on land degradation, and South Korea on plastics — failing to deliver meaningful outcomes**.

These meetings brought together governments, researchers, policymakers, industries, and civil society organisations to ensure their goals were aligned, build equitable accountability, and mobilise adequate finance for action. But all four summits achieved no or partial success on issues they had set to address. In fact, this is the fourth time UN discussions designed to push countries toward significant progress in addressing biodiversity loss, climate change, and plastic pollution have either ended without consensus or yielded unsatisfactory outcomes.

This is a significant setback in global efforts to address biodiversity loss and climate change, potentially leading to delayed action on critical issues such as climate finance, drought mitigation, and plastic pollution, with the most vulnerable countries potentially suffering the greatest impact.

The partial or full failures of these talks raise pressing concerns about the global community’s ability to combat biodiversity loss, climate change, and other urgent environmental crises. Understanding the reasons behind these setbacks and their implications for global cooperation is essential to charting a more effective path forward.

### Divergent national interests

At the heart of the talks’ breakdown lies a stark and growing divergence in national priorities. Developing nations, grappling with developmental challenges, economic constraints, and the impacts of climate change, have repeatedly demanded more technology transfer and financial support from developed countries. But developed nations are reluctant to commit additional resources, citing domestic political pressures and economic challenges of their own.

For example, the Colombia talks on biodiversity conservation faltered as countries failed to agree on financing mechanisms to support sustainable land-use practices. Financing conservation at scale came to a gridlock with countries lagging in ambition, being nowhere close to delivering the $700 billion-a-year requirement. In Azerbaijan, developing nations demanded $1.3 trillion a year from developed nations, and the talks ended with the latter loosely agreeing to raise the amount from a wide range of sources, including private investment.

Also in Azerbaijan, countries were divided over the pledge to transition away from fossil fuels, a decision made during the last UN climate summit. The plastic pollution talks in South Korea also brought to the fore a significant divide among participating nations. The meeting concluded without reaching an agreement primarily because countries that rely on economies dependent on ongoing demand for plastics opposed a legally binding treaty. Instead, they pushed for proper usage and recycling of plastic waste.

### Consensus and crises

Several talks stumbled on disagreements over the frameworks needed to monitor and enforce environmental goals. In Azerbaijan, discussions on implementing the global stocktake under the Paris Agreement saw divisions over the accountability mechanisms for emission reductions, particularly for high-emission nations.

In Saudi Arabia, industrialised nations clashed with African countries over the establishment of a legally binding drought protocol. While the former wanted a broad operational framework, the African nations demanded a concrete plan with economic commitments.

Global crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic, economic instability, and geopolitical conflicts, have created significant challenges for environmental action. They have diverted attention and resources away from pressing environmental priorities as governments grapple with urgent domestic concerns such as public health, economic recovery, and social stability.

For many countries, particularly those with limited institutional and/or financial capacity, the challenge to balance economic recovery efforts with long-term sustainability goals has weakened their negotiating positions. This has further reduced their willingness or ability to commit to ambitious environmental targets.

Developing economies, in particular, face heightened difficulties as they navigate inflation, debt burdens, and overall developmental challenges alongside climate vulnerabilities, leading to calls for greater financial and technological support from wealthier nations.

### Growing divide, lack of consensus

These setbacks in global negotiations complicate the already daunting task of addressing global environmental challenges.

**Delayed action**: The inability and failure to agree on frameworks and commit to concrete actions by nations postpone critical measures required to fight global issues such as biodiversity loss, climate change, land degradation, and plastic pollution. This delay increases the likelihood of pushing global systems closer to irreversible tipping points, with severe consequences for communities and economies worldwide.

**Incoherent, fragmented efforts**: As multilateral processes falter, there is a growing risk of countries turning to unilateral regional action. While these initiatives are well-meaning and can make progress, they would lack the global coherence necessary to address environmental issues comprehensively and equitably and could trigger new problems because of a lack of coordination among nations.

**Erosion of trust**: Repeated failures in negotiations risk undermining confidence among nations, making future cooperation even more difficult.

**Pressure on future summits**: The failure of multiple global negotiations on the environment further forces upcoming meetings to deliver meaningful outcomes.

### Rebuilding momentum

To advance global environmental goals, several key strategies must be prioritised. Climate finance is key to this. Wealthier nations must honour their commitments to provide financial and technological support to developing nations. This would create a more equitable foundation for negotiations and help bridge trust gaps between developed and developing economies.

Equally critical is the need to enhance transparency and accountability by establishing robust mechanisms to track progress and hold nations accountable for their commitments. This would play a vital role in restoring confidence in multilateral processes.

Inclusive diplomacy is also essential to address geopolitical tensions and ensure all voices, particularly those of vulnerable nations, are heard in negotiations. By promoting equitable participation, global cooperation can become more effective and resilient.

Further, there must be a strong focus on implementation — shifting the emphasis from ambitious pledges to tangible action — backed by measurable outcomes. This pragmatic approach ensures progress even in the face of broader disagreements.

Finally, it is crucial to acknowledge and address connections between biodiversity loss, land degradation, plastic pollution, and climate change — a complex web of environmental crises that amplify one another. Climate change accelerates habitat destruction, ultimately leading to biodiversity loss, while degraded ecosystems such as deforested lands, desertification and land degradation or overexploited soils release carbon, exacerbating global warming.

Similarly, plastic pollution harms marine and terrestrial ecosystems and contributes to greenhouse gas emissions during its production and degradation. Addressing these issues in isolation has proven insufficient. Global environmental talks must therefore prioritise these interconnections, foster integrated strategies that protect ecosystems, restore degraded landscapes, and reduce pollution while tackling climate change.

The challenges are immense, but so are the stakes. As environmental crises intensify, the world can’t afford further stalemates. It is imperative for nations to move beyond short-term interests and embrace a shared vision for a sustainable future.

> In 2024, four major UN environmental summits—focused on biodiversity, climate change, land degradation, and plastic pollution—failed to achieve significant progress. Divergent national interests, particularly between developed and developing nations, led to disagreements over financial commitments and technology transfers. The influence of fossil fuel industries and geopolitical tensions further impeded consensus. Consequently, critical issues like biodiversity loss, climate finance, drought mitigation, and plastic pollution remain inadequately addressed, highlighting the challenges in global environmental governance.

# In search of a ‘grand strategy’ for India’s foreign policy in the 21st century

**In Search of a ‘Grand Strategy’ for India’s Foreign Policy in the 21st Century**

The concept of a "grand strategy" has long guided nations in navigating international politics by aligning national power and resources with strategic objectives. Historically, thinkers like **Chanakya** in his *Arthashastra*, **Thucydides** in *History of the Peloponnesian War*, **Sun Tzu** in *The Art of War*, and **Carl von Clausewitz** in *On War* focused on warfare as the principal tool of statecraft. However, in today’s complex, multipolar world, where global interdependence often tempers outright conflict, the challenge lies in redefining grand strategy to encompass diplomacy, economic policy, and military strength in a peaceful yet competitive international landscape. For India, an emerging global power, crafting a coherent grand strategy is both essential and challenging.

### **India’s Geopolitical Context**

India’s geographical location gives it a strategic advantage. Bordered by nuclear powers like **China** and **Pakistan**, sharing maritime boundaries in the Indian Ocean, and close to critical trade routes, India’s security and economic prosperity are intrinsically linked to regional and global stability. Furthermore, India must navigate complex relationships with global powers such as the **United States**, **Russia**, and the **European Union**, while managing regional dynamics in **South Asia**, the **Indian Ocean Region (IOR)**, and broader **Indo-Pacific** strategies.

### **Economic Ambitions and Global Integration**

India's economic growth has been central to its global aspirations. As the world’s **fifth-largest economy**, India seeks to expand its influence through trade partnerships, technological innovation, and participation in global governance institutions like the **G20**, **BRICS**, and the **Quad**. Economic diplomacy, including initiatives like the **Make in India** campaign and free trade agreements with key partners, is critical in achieving energy security, infrastructure growth, and technological advancements. However, India must balance its protectionist tendencies with the need for global economic integration.

### **Military Modernization and Strategic Autonomy**

India's military strength is a key pillar of its strategic posture. With longstanding security threats from **Pakistan** and a growing rivalry with **China**, especially after border clashes in **Galwan Valley (2020)**, India has prioritized military modernization. Simultaneously, India emphasizes "strategic autonomy," maintaining its independence in foreign policy decisions without aligning strictly with any power bloc. This principle is evident in India’s nuanced stance on global conflicts, such as its neutral position during the **Russia-Ukraine war**, reflecting a careful balance between its defense ties with Russia and its strategic partnership with Western nations.

### **Diplomatic Engagements and Soft Power**

India's diplomatic strategy involves engaging in multilateral forums like the **United Nations**, **WTO**, and the **International Solar Alliance (ISA)** to project leadership on global issues like climate change and sustainable development. Moreover, India leverages its **soft power**—through its diaspora, cultural exports (Bollywood, yoga), and humanitarian aid—to build goodwill. Programs like the **Vaccine Maitri** initiative during the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated India's commitment to global health diplomacy.

### **Challenges to a Coherent Grand Strategy**

India faces several internal and external challenges in forming a cohesive grand strategy. Internally, political polarization, socio-economic disparities, and bureaucratic inertia can hinder strategic consistency. Externally, navigating relationships with China, managing border disputes, addressing terrorism threats, and responding to the U.S.-China rivalry complicate India’s strategic calculations. Additionally, emerging domains like **cybersecurity**, **space technology**, and **climate change** require proactive policy integration into its grand strategy.

### **The Path Forward**

To establish a robust grand strategy, India must prioritize the following:

1. **Economic Resilience:** Strengthen manufacturing, supply chain diversification, and technological self-reliance while engaging in global trade.  
2. **Defense Modernization:** Invest in indigenous defense capabilities while deepening strategic partnerships, particularly in the Indo-Pacific.  
3. **Multilateral Leadership:** Lead on global issues like climate change, health security, and digital governance.  
4. **Regional Stability:** Act as a net security provider in South Asia and the Indian Ocean Region to counterbalance China’s influence.  
5. **Soft Power Expansion:** Use cultural diplomacy and development aid to enhance global influence.  

### **Conclusion**

India’s pursuit of a grand strategy in the 21st century requires a delicate balance of economic ambition, military preparedness, diplomatic engagement, and soft power projection. It must adapt to global shifts while safeguarding its strategic autonomy. Learning from historical strategists like Chanakya and Clausewitz, India must craft a comprehensive, forward-looking strategy that addresses contemporary challenges and secures its position as a leading global power.

> India's 21st-century grand strategy must balance economic growth, military strength, and diplomatic engagement to secure its global position. Geopolitically, India faces challenges from China and Pakistan while navigating global partnerships with the U.S., Russia, and the EU. Economic ambitions drive initiatives like *Make in India*, while military modernization ensures security amid regional tensions. India emphasizes strategic autonomy, multilateral diplomacy, and soft power through cultural outreach and humanitarian aid. Internal challenges and global shifts require India to strengthen economic resilience, defense, regional stability, and global leadership to emerge as a major global power in an evolving world order.

# 10 public varsities in Karnataka do not have any permanent teaching staff

The situation in Karnataka's public universities presents several critical challenges that have significant implications for the state's higher education system. Here's an in-depth analysis of the issue:

### **Key Issues Identified**

1. **Severe Shortage of Teaching and Non-Teaching Staff**  
   - Out of 4,709 sanctioned teaching posts, only 1,986 are filled. This leaves 2,723 (≈57.8%) positions vacant.  
   - Out of 9,317 sanctioned non-teaching posts, only 2,989 are filled. This leaves 6,328 (≈67.9%) positions vacant.  
   - 10 universities, including Dr. B.R. Ambedkar School of Economics and Karnataka State Dr. Gangubai Hangal Music and Performing Arts University, have *zero* permanent staff.  

2. **Impact on Academic and Administrative Functioning**  
   - Guest lecturers are being hired to manage academic activities, but they cannot take up leadership roles like Head of Department (HOD), causing administrative stagnation.  
   - Non-teaching responsibilities are being outsourced, leading to potential inefficiencies and lack of institutional accountability.  
   - The lack of permanent staff is causing a decline in the quality of education, prompting students to migrate to private institutions.  

3. **Disproportionate Growth in Infrastructure vs. Staffing**  
   - The establishment of seven new universities by the previous government lacked foresight in terms of staffing and infrastructure.  
   - Universities are operating with skeletal permanent staff (as low as four or five members in some cases), making effective functioning difficult.  

4. **Declining Student Enrolment**  
   - The direct impact of inadequate staffing is reflected in dropping student admissions, threatening the long-term sustainability of public universities.  

5. **Government Response**  
   - While guest lecturers are filling immediate gaps, this is a temporary measure that cannot address core institutional needs.  
   - The Higher Education Minister's plan to submit proposals to the Finance Department is a positive step, but it lacks immediate actionable solutions.  

---

### **Consequences and Risks**

- **Academic Decline:** Persistent vacancies in teaching roles diminish research output and quality teaching.  
- **Administrative Inefficiency:** Outsourcing and lack of permanent non-teaching staff slow down routine operations.  
- **Erosion of Public Trust:** Students' shift to private universities reflects decreasing trust in public institutions.  
- **Long-Term Sustainability Risk:** If enrolment continues to drop, some universities may face closure or mergers.

---

### **Recommendations for Resolution**

1. **Immediate Recruitment Drive:**  
   - Prioritize filling critical teaching and non-teaching vacancies.  
   - Fast-track recruitment processes through special committees or state-level task forces.  

2. **Strategic Resource Allocation:**  
   - Review the feasibility of all newly established universities to ensure optimal distribution of resources.  
   - Consider consolidating underperforming institutions to pool resources effectively.  

3. **Strengthen Faculty Development:**  
   - Provide incentives for permanent faculty recruitment, including research grants and professional development programs.  

4. **Infrastructure and Policy Support:**  
   - Develop infrastructure in tandem with human resource allocation for balanced growth.  
   - Implement performance-based funding models to encourage quality improvements.  

5. **Regular Monitoring and Accountability:**  
   - Set up regular audits and monitoring mechanisms to track staffing and performance metrics.  

6. **Public-Private Collaboration:**  
   - Encourage partnerships with private institutions for resource sharing, guest lectures, and research collaboration to bridge the gap temporarily.  

---

### **Conclusion**

The chronic staff shortage in Karnataka’s public universities is a systemic issue stemming from inadequate planning and execution. While the government's recognition of the problem is a step in the right direction, swift and decisive action is necessary to prevent further decline in academic standards and restore public confidence in the state's higher education system.

> Karnataka's public universities face a severe shortage of teaching and non-teaching staff, with 2,723 teaching and 6,328 non-teaching posts vacant. Ten universities, including Dr. B.R. Ambedkar School of Economics and Karnataka State Dr. Gangubai Hangal Music and Performing Arts University, have no permanent staff. Academic activities rely on guest lecturers, and administrative tasks are outsourced, leading to declining education quality and student enrolment.

The Higher Education Minister has proposed filling vacancies, but immediate recruitment and strategic reforms are crucial to sustaining public universities and improving educational standards.
