# India, Indonesia stress peace in ASEAN region

India and Indonesia have recently reinforced their commitment to maintaining peace and stability in the ASEAN region through a series of strategic agreements and diplomatic engagements. On January 25, 2025, Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi witnessed the signing of comprehensive agreements encompassing culture, health, maritime security, and digital sectors. These agreements aim to accelerate economic partnerships and long-term cooperation between the two nations. President Subianto expressed gratitude for India's support in Indonesia's bid to join BRICS, highlighting the bloc's potential benefits for global stability and regional collaboration. Prime Minister Modi emphasized plans for cooperation in defense manufacturing, supply chains, maritime security, cybersecurity, counter-terrorism, and de-radicalization. 
Historically, India and Indonesia share deep-rooted cultural and historical ties, with interactions spanning over two millennia. Religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism, and later Islam traveled from India to Indonesia, significantly influencing its cultural and religious landscape. Post-independence, both nations shared aspirations for political sovereignty and economic self-sufficiency, becoming significant voices in the Non-Aligned Movement.
In recent years, the bilateral relationship has been further strengthened through high-level visits and strategic agreements. In 2018, Prime Minister Modi's visit to Jakarta led to the signing of the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership and a shared vision on Indo-Pacific maritime cooperation. Defense cooperation has been a cornerstone of this partnership, with joint military exercises such as Garuda Shakti (Army) and Samudra Shakti (Navy), as well as coordinated patrols (IND-INDO CORPAT). The inaugural India-Indonesia Defense Industry Exhibition in 2024 showcased opportunities for collaboration in defense technology and manufacturing. 
Economically, Indonesia is India's second-largest trading partner in ASEAN, with bilateral trade reaching $29.4 billion in 2023-24. Indian businesses have invested over $1.56 billion in sectors like mining, textiles, and infrastructure in Indonesia. Enhanced connectivity through direct flights between major cities has also strengthened people-to-people ties and boosted tourism. 
Both nations are active participants in multilateral forums such as the G20, ASEAN, and the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA), collaborating on maritime security, sustainable development, and regional stability. Their partnership is pivotal in shaping the regional and global landscape, ensuring mutual growth and stability in the Indo-Pacific.
In summary, the India-Indonesia bilateral relationship exemplifies a blend of historical camaraderie and strategic collaboration. With shared values and mutual respect, both nations continue to deepen their ties, fostering a prosperous and peaceful future in the ASEAN region.

# Why has the U.S. often exited climate pacts?

Among the first executive orders that Donald Trump signed after taking over as President on January 20 was to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Agreement of 2015. This makes it the third time the U.S. has withdrawn from a treaty signed under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

### What is the history of U.S. engagement with climate treaties?

The first time the U.S. withdrew from a climate agreement was in 2001 when President George W. Bush exited the Kyoto Protocol, adopted in 1997. This agreement was significant as it was the first time 37 industrialised countries had binding targets to lower carbon dioxide emissions. However, Mr. Bush withdrew the U.S., on the grounds that it crimped the economy. “I oppose the Kyoto Protocol because it exempts 80% of the world, including major population centres such as China and India, from compliance, and would cause serious harm to the U.S. economy,” he wrote in a letter to Republican senators.

When Mr. Trump first withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Agreement in 2017, his reasons were similar: “I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris,” he said. “The Paris deal hamstrings the U.S. while empowering some of the world’s top polluting countries... That is not going to happen while I am President.” Exiting the agreement meant the U.S. would cease to implement its targets to cut emissions and contribute to the ‘green climate fund,’ — a corpus to help climate-vulnerable countries adapt to climate change. In the new order, eight years later, he says that the Paris Agreement “... steered American taxpayer dollars to countries that do not require, or merit, financial assistance in the interests of the American people.”

However, when the U.S. withdrew in 2017, it did not practically result in an ejection. Technicalities in the drafting of the Paris Agreement meant that it would take a signatory country three years to withdraw and an extra year, intimating the United Nations governing body. This meant that by the time the withdrawal took effect in November 2020, Joe Biden had already been elected the 46th U.S. President; and in January 2021, he promptly signed the U.S. back in. The Paris Agreement committed all countries to collectively strive to keep temperatures from exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius or pre-industrial times, failing which to certainly keep it below 2 degrees Celsius. Unlike Mr. Trump’s 2017 order, his latest order will withdraw the U.S. within a year.

### How does the U.S. view climate agreements?

Until 2006, the U.S. was the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases. As the world’s largest economy, its general attitude towards the European Union-backed climate pacts has been to project itself as solving the climate crisis but being non-committal towards taking the legally binding emission cuts that this entailed. Right from the first Conference of Parties in Bonn in 1995, the U.S. expressed discomfort with a fundamental axiom of the UNFCCC — the mother convention that gives treaties such as the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement meaning. This is because carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere were largely due to historical emissions by developed countries, it was incumbent on them to pay the bulk of the costs for clean-up.

It also translated to developing countries continuing on a fossil-fuel pathway. Due to discomfort expressed by major fossil fuel economies — the U.S., Australia, and Canada — ideas such as joint implementation (where countries earn credits for implementing clean energy projects in developing countries) surfaced. The U.S., despite having walked out of climate agreements, continues to send large delegations to the conference as ‘observers’ and be closely involved in negotiations.

In 2005, at COP 11 in Montreal, Canada, the head of the U.S. delegation, as reported by The New York Times, walked out of the negotiations despite the U.S. not being part of the Kyoto Protocol at the time. To cut to the present, there is bipartisan support for not crimping oil and gas production in the U.S. Oil and gas production has risen under the Biden administration. The U.S. remains the world’s largest crude oil producer and achieved record production in 2023. The country is also the largest producer of gas and, in 2022, became the world’s largest exporter of liquefied natural gas. Mr. Trump has committed to adding to this already substantial base.

Despite all this, the U.S. is critically short of achieving its greenhouse gas emissions target. As of 2022, the U.S. has achieved only about one-third of its 2030 emissions reduction goal. In the last weeks of his presidency, Mr. Biden increased the U.S. emissions reduction commitments to 61%-66% of 2005 levels by 2035.

### What will be the fallout of the U.S. exit?

The U.S. has only exited the Paris Agreement, not the overarching UNFCCC. Several analysts have pointed out that the scale of investments in renewable energy, including private finance from the U.S., have vastly grown since 2017. Unlike India, China, and Indonesia — large developing economies dependent on coal — the U.S. is less reliant on it. The U.S. has historically supported the EU on anti-coal positions in climate negotiations.

Mr. Trump’s espousal of a ‘Drill, baby, drill!’ motto encourages more fracking and oil-and-gas drilling, which previous dispensations have only modestly slowed.

A U.S. exit might lead to developing countries taking on less ambitious targets, but given that climate targets have not managed to slow down global emissions, the U.S.’s exit at this point means little.

> The U.S. has often exited climate pacts due to concerns over economic implications, national sovereignty, and perceived inequities in responsibilities. Critics argue that such agreements, like the Kyoto Protocol or the Paris Agreement, place heavier burdens on developed nations while allowing developing nations, such as China and India, to emit more. Economic concerns about job losses and competitiveness in industries like coal and manufacturing also influence decisions. Additionally, shifts in political ideologies between administrations often lead to inconsistent climate policies. For instance, the Trump administration withdrew from the Paris Agreement, citing potential economic harm, while the Biden administration rejoined it.

# Nano-urea reduced grain yield: study

Recent studies have investigated the efficacy of nano-urea as an alternative to conventional urea fertilizers in crop production. While nano-urea has been promoted for its potential to enhance nutrient use efficiency and reduce environmental impact, research findings indicate that its application can lead to reduced grain yields in certain scenarios.

A study published in *Scientific Reports* examined the effects of substituting traditional urea with nano-urea in wheat cultivation. The researchers found that replacing conventional urea fertilization with foliar applications of nano-urea decreased both growth and yield in wheat crops. Specifically, the study reported that the foliar sprays of nano-urea did not match the effectiveness of soil-applied prilled urea, leading to lower biomass accumulation and grain yield. 

Similarly, research conducted by Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) assessed the impact of nano-urea on wheat and rice yields. The findings revealed a 21.6% reduction in wheat yield and a 13% decrease in rice yield when nano-urea was used in place of conventional urea. These results suggest that nano-urea may not provide the necessary nitrogen levels required for optimal crop growth and productivity. 

Further studies have explored the combined use of nano-urea with other fertilizers. For instance, a study published in the *Journal of Soil Science and Plant Nutrition* investigated the performance of urea and nano-urea in conjunction with farmyard manure in wheat cultivation. The results indicated that using 50% of the recommended nitrogen (65 kg N ha‑1) with two foliar applications of nano-urea at a rate of 2.5 liters per hectare reduced grain yields compared to the standard urea application. 

Conversely, some research suggests that partial substitution of conventional urea with nano-urea can maintain yields while reducing urea usage. A study evaluating nano-urea as a substitute for prilled urea in wheat cultivation concluded that applying three nano-urea sprays allowed for a 25% reduction in conventional urea usage without compromising yield. However, the study cautioned that higher substitution rates might lead to yield declines, emphasizing the need for balanced application strategies.

In summary, while nano-urea presents a promising avenue for enhancing fertilizer efficiency and reducing environmental impacts, current research indicates that complete replacement of conventional urea with nano-urea can lead to decreased grain yields in crops like wheat and rice. Partial substitution strategies may offer a more balanced approach, but further research is necessary to determine optimal application rates and methods to ensure sustainable and productive agricultural practices.

> Recent studies reveal that replacing conventional urea with nano-urea can reduce grain yields in crops like wheat and rice. Research by Punjab Agricultural University showed a 21.6% yield reduction in wheat and 13% in rice when nano-urea was used exclusively. Other studies highlight that foliar sprays of nano-urea are less effective than soil-applied urea, leading to lower biomass and grain production. However, partial substitution of conventional urea with nano-urea has shown promise, maintaining yields while reducing urea usage by 25%. The findings emphasize the need for balanced application strategies and further research to optimize nano-urea's potential in sustainable farming.
