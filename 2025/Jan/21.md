# Settle with borrowers only after exhausting all options, RBI tells ARCs

### **Analysis of Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs)**

**Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs)** are specialized financial institutions established to help banks and financial institutions manage and resolve non-performing assets (NPAs). Their primary role is to acquire bad loans from banks at a discounted rate and focus on recovering them or restructuring them to maximize value.

---

### **How ARCs Function**
1. **Acquisition of NPAs:**
   - ARCs buy NPAs from banks at a discount, providing the banks immediate liquidity and reducing their burden of stressed assets.
   - Banks can focus on core operations while ARCs specialize in recovery and restructuring.

2. **Resolution Mechanisms:**
   - ARCs recover value through measures like restructuring loans, asset liquidation, settlements with borrowers, or selling the stressed assets to other entities.

3. **Funding Sources:**
   - ARCs use funds raised through **Security Receipts (SRs)** issued to qualified institutional buyers, such as banks or financial institutions, for purchasing NPAs.

---

### **RBI’s Directive: Settlements as a Last Resort**
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has directed ARCs to **settle with borrowers only after exhausting all other options**. This move is aimed at:
- Ensuring that ARCs maximize recoveries and avoid quick settlements that could lead to losses for banks and investors.
- Promoting a more rigorous approach to resolution, including litigation, asset sales, and restructuring, before opting for settlements.

---

### **Rationale Behind RBI’s Directive**
1. **Strengthening Financial Discipline:**
   - Borrowers might exploit easy settlements to avoid fulfilling their obligations, undermining the recovery process.
   - Exhausting all options ensures that borrowers are held accountable and financial discipline is maintained.

2. **Protecting Investor Interests:**
   - Settlements at a lower value may impact the returns for investors holding Security Receipts (SRs), particularly institutional investors like banks.
   - A structured recovery process ensures better returns.

3. **Enhancing Transparency:**
   - Encourages ARCs to adopt a clear, systematic approach to resolution, reducing the possibility of arbitrary or undervalued settlements.

4. **Improving Banking Sector Stability:**
   - Effective resolution of NPAs helps banks recover funds and strengthens their financial health, contributing to overall economic stability.

---

### **Role of ARCs in NPA Management**
- **Benefits:**
  - Relieve banks of stressed assets, allowing them to focus on core operations.
  - Specialized expertise in handling bad loans improves recovery rates.
  - Contribute to financial stability by addressing systemic NPA issues.

- **Challenges:**
  - High dependence on settlements can lead to suboptimal recoveries.
  - Limited resources for litigation or complex restructuring.
  - Need for regulatory oversight to ensure fair and transparent practices.

---

### **Conclusion**
ARCs play a vital role in managing India’s growing NPAs, acting as intermediaries to recover and resolve stressed assets. The RBI’s directive to prioritize recovery options before settlements ensures a disciplined approach to asset resolution, protects investor interests, and strengthens the financial system. This move is expected to enhance the efficiency and accountability of ARCs, contributing to a healthier banking sector and a more robust financial ecosystem.

# We need distinguished jurists as judges

A critical aspect of a judicial system is the effective and timely delivery of justice. This can be achieved in the Indian judicial system only if the significant crisis of backlogs and vacancies is addressed urgently by both the judiciary and the government.

Data as of January 1, 2025, show that 371 posts of the 1,122 posts sanctioned across the High Courts of the country remain vacant. The Allahabad High Court functions at only 50% of its total sanctioned strength. Naturally, this has a direct impact on the already alarming levels of backlog. As millions of people have to wait for a long time for justice, their faith in the judicial system is eroding. Although this has been a perennial issue, there are now about 60 lakh cases pending across all the High Courts, an astonishing number. To solve this, we need both immediate remedial steps and reformative measures.

While it is true that the pace of Collegium recommendations and the resulting appointments has picked up in the last couple of years, it has unfortunately not been able to match the number of retirements and ever-increasing number of filings. In turn, this has put enormous strain on the system, compelling judges to take on a higher caseload than feasible. This is likely to adversely impact both the time given to as well as the depth of engagement with a particular case. Therefore, a well-staffed judiciary functioning at near-total sanctioned strength is the need of the hour.

### A game changer

In that context, Article 124(3)(c) and Article 217(2)(c), now repealed, of the Constitution become increasingly significant. These provisions allow for the appointment of individuals who, in the opinion of the President (read Collegium), are ‘distinguished jurists’, as judges of the Supreme Court and the High Courts. Unfortunately, Article 124(3)(c) remains unutilised and Article 217(2)(c) has been repealed without any stated reason. In other words, no jurist has been found to be distinguished enough to be appointed to these posts till date. Although it is a routine practice in jurisdictions across the globe to appoint jurists as judges, appointments to the High Courts and the Supreme Court in India have always been either from the Bar (practising advocates) or the judicial services.

At a time when the issue of vacancies and backlogs is stifling the system, introducing and invoking the provision to appoint ‘distinguished jurists’ to High Courts of the country can turn out to be a game changer. In fact, a similar idea was floated by Shri Shibban Lal Saxena but negatived by the Constituent Assembly on June 7, 1949, without any meaningful deliberation.

Involving the world of academia directly into the mainstream Indian judicial system can bring both immense benefits and challenges. A vast pool of specialised knowledge, research-based critical thinking, and expertise can provide unique insights and add a hitherto missing dimension to the judiciary’s understanding of complex socioeconomic and socio-legal cases. At the same time, the lack of courtroom experience, procedural knowledge, understanding of limits to exercising judicial power, and a certain degree of resistance among the status quoists within the institution are challenges that will need to be overcome as well.

### An important message

A number of countries (such as the United States, Poland, Myanmar, Kenya, Thailand, Spain and Italy) that allow jurists or professors of law to be appointed to posts equivalent to that of a judge in the High Courts and/or the Supreme Court of India have vastly benefited from this practice. In India, where academia has expressed its legitimate concerns and grievances of not having been adequately nurtured or supported, re-introducing Article 217(2)(c) and appointing jurists or academics as judges of the High Courts would send across an important message. At the same time, with adequate training of procedural know-how and courtroom experience, the presence of our sharpest academic minds on the Bench would ensure that the judicial discourse is enriched and that judicial decision-making is further strengthened.

Granting an opportunity to distinguished academics to effectively engage with the complex problems of the contemporary legal world would lend a fresh perspective to the cause of justice. Such appointees would naturally serve as a bridge between academia and practice. This would lead to a synergistic interaction of legal research with the more nuanced and practical aspects of delivering justice.

Therefore, the need of the hour is to tide over the current crisis of increasing backlogs, and bridge the widening gap between the actual strength and the sanctioned strength of courts. First, the government must comply with the Collegium’s recommendations within a strict time frame. Second, deploying innovating solutions, such as re-introducing and invoking Article 217(2)(c) to appoint distinguished jurists to High Courts, would help fill existing vacancies. Tapping into the academic world as a valuable resource sector would help ensure that the Indian judicial system remains dynamic, robust, and diverse, grounded in practical realities as well as an in-depth understanding of its underlying constitutional principles. By drawing upon the expertise of our sharpest academic minds, India will be able to address the existing concerns and enhance the quality of the judiciary’s output. Such a step could prove to be transformative for the Indian judiciary in the years to come.

> Appointing distinguished jurists as judges enhances the judiciary’s intellectual depth and diversity. These individuals bring extensive legal scholarship, critical thinking, and expertise, complementing the practical experience of career judges. Their unique perspectives can enrich constitutional interpretation, improve judicial decision-making, and address complex legal challenges in an evolving society. Such appointments also reinforce public confidence in the judiciary, showcasing merit-based selection and upholding justice. However, clear criteria for identifying and integrating jurists into the judicial system are essential to balance academic excellence with practical judicial requirements, ensuring an effective and inclusive judiciary that serves the nation’s legal and societal needs.

# UGC’s draft regulation has serious constitutional issues

The **University Grants Commission (UGC)’s draft regulations**, if found constitutionally problematic, raise significant concerns regarding their compliance with the principles of federalism, autonomy, and the fundamental rights enshrined in the Indian Constitution. Here’s an analysis of the key constitutional issues:

---

### **1. Federalism and Educational Autonomy**
- **Violation of State Rights:**
  - Education is a subject on the **Concurrent List** (Seventh Schedule), allowing both the Union and State governments to legislate. However, the draft regulations may encroach upon the states’ domain by centralizing decision-making.
  - This undermines the spirit of **cooperative federalism**, as states are crucial stakeholders in higher education policy and implementation.

- **Impact on State Universities:**
  - Imposing uniform regulations might restrict the ability of state universities to address region-specific needs, diminishing their functional autonomy.

---

### **2. Erosion of Institutional Autonomy**
- **Overreach in University Governance:**
  - UGC’s draft regulations often dictate administrative and academic policies, such as faculty appointments, curricula, and operational guidelines, reducing universities’ autonomy.
  - This contravenes the principles laid out in **Article 19(1)(g)** of the Constitution, which protects the right to practice any profession, including the freedom of educational institutions to manage their affairs.

- **Violation of Academic Freedom:**
  - Excessive regulation can stifle innovation and academic diversity, contradicting the constitutional value of fostering a free and progressive intellectual environment.

---

### **3. Conflict with Fundamental Rights**
- **Violation of Equality (Article 14):**
  - Imposing standardized rules may disproportionately affect smaller or less-resourced institutions, creating inequities in higher education.
  - Discrimination between centrally funded and state-funded institutions in resource allocation or compliance requirements could also contravene the right to equality.

- **Impact on Right to Education (Article 21A):**
  - If regulations lead to financial strain or procedural hurdles, it could indirectly impact access to quality higher education, particularly for marginalized communities.

---

### **4. Encroachment on Legislative Powers**
- **Conflict with State Laws:**
  - Many states have their own universities governed by state legislation. UGC regulations that override these laws may lead to constitutional disputes under **Article 254**, which addresses inconsistencies between Union and State laws.
  - This could trigger legal challenges, as states may view UGC’s regulations as undermining their legislative prerogatives.

---

### **5. Judicial Scrutiny and Precedents**
- **Judicial Oversight:**
  - Courts have previously emphasized the importance of university autonomy and the balance between central regulation and institutional freedom.
  - Any regulation perceived as arbitrary or overreaching could be struck down under **Article 13**, which prohibits laws violating fundamental rights.

---

### **Examples of Recent Issues**
- **Common University Entrance Test (CUET):**
  - The CUET mandated by UGC for undergraduate admissions in central universities has drawn criticism for its one-size-fits-all approach, potentially marginalizing students from diverse educational backgrounds.
  
- **Regulation of Online and Distance Learning:**
  - UGC’s strict controls over online and distance education limit the flexibility of institutions to innovate and adapt, which is crucial for democratizing higher education.

---

### **Conclusion**
UGC’s draft regulations, while aimed at standardizing and improving the quality of higher education, raise serious constitutional concerns by encroaching upon state rights, institutional autonomy, and fundamental rights. A collaborative and consultative approach, respecting the principles of federalism and diversity, is essential to ensure the regulations align with constitutional values and the broader goals of India’s education system.

> The UGC’s draft regulations raise constitutional concerns by potentially violating principles of federalism, institutional autonomy, and fundamental rights. Education, a Concurrent List subject, sees states as key stakeholders, but the draft centralizes decision-making, encroaching on state rights and university autonomy. Overregulation impacts academic freedom and could contravene **Article 19(1)(g)**. Uniform rules risk inequities, violating **Article 14**, while financial or procedural burdens may hinder access to education, conflicting with **Article 21A**. Additionally, conflicts with state laws under **Article 254** could lead to legal disputes. A cooperative approach respecting constitutional values is essential to balance regulation and autonomy in higher education.
