# The impact of classifying denotified tribes

The Anthropological Survey of India (AnSI) and Tribal Research Institutes (TRI) across the country have for the first time comprehensively categorised 268 denotified, semi-nomadic, and nomadic tribes that were thought to have never been classified before. After a three-year study, the AnSI and TRIs have recommended the inclusion of 179 of these communities in the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Classes lists. At least 85 of these communities are being recommended for a classification for the first time ever. The study also found that 63 communities that had never been classified were “not traceable” anymore — meaning that they had likely assimilated into larger communities, changed their names, or migrated to other States.

### Why was the study needed?

Ever since the Criminal Tribes Act of 1924 was repealed in August 1949, after which communities notified as “criminal” had been denotified, successive commissions have tried to classify these communities, starting with the First Backward Classes Commission headed by Kaka Kalelkar.

Since then, the Lokur Committee (1965), the Mandal Commission (1980), the Renke Commission (2008), and the Idate Commission (2017) have tried to classify such tribes across the country. However, they have fallen short of being able to identify all such communities.

The last Commission tasked with this was the one headed by Bhiku Ramji Idate, which submitted its report in December 2017. In this report, it had listed a total of over 1,200 denotified, semi-nomadic, and nomadic tribes across the country, apart from which, it said there were 267 communities that had never been classified. The Idate Commission’s report had noted that previous commissions had never been able to classify these communities, recommending strongly that the classification work be completed as soon as possible. To this end, the Prime Minister’s Office constituted a Special Committee in February 2019, headed by the Vice Chairperson of the NITI Aayog, consisting of Mr. Idate, Dr. J.K. Bajaj of the Centre for Policy Studies, and the Director-General of the AnSI as members. This Committee gave the work of classification to the AnSI and TRIs, which began work on the project in February 2020, submitting a report in August 2023.

### What is the need for categorisation?

The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Social Justice and Empowerment had in a December 2022 report said that it had repeatedly flagged the government’s “inability to take necessary action” on the speedy categorisation of these communities. “Delay in locating them would increase their suffering and they would not be able to get benefits of the prevailing schemes meant for the welfare of SC/STs,” the House panel said.

S. Narayan, Professor Emeritus at the Institute of Social Sciences in New Delhi pointed out that the issue with wrong categorisation began with some of the first Censuses ever conducted by colonial administrations. “There were many instances of tribes being classified as castes and vice versa. Many of it may have had political considerations behind it and this continued after Independence as well.” He added that while the act of including communities in SC, ST, OBC lists may be political, when one applies an anthropological lens to it, the classifications are bound to be different.

Further, community activists and experts like Dr. B.K. Lodhi, who also assisted the Idate Commission in its work, said that in the absence of a complete list of denotified, semi-nomadic, and nomadic communities across the country, it has been very difficult to organise the communities and its peoples. “Some are classified as SC, ST, OBC, some of this is also incorrect. And beyond this, there are hundreds that have not been classified.”

### What will be the impact?

Now that almost all denotified, nomadic, and semi-nomadic tribes are closer to being classified than ever before, one impact has been political. Community activists across U.P., Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, and Gujarat are pushing hard to question the premise of classifying these communities as SC, ST, and OBC altogether, with an eye on reservations.

Within the Development and Welfare Board for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Communities, there are now two strands of thoughts. One calls for the completion of the classification process so that all denotified, nomadic, and semi-nomadic tribes get benefits meant for them as per the classification of SC, ST, or OBC, including that of reservation. The other calls for creating a separate classification altogether — for denotified tribes in the form of a Schedule in the Constitution. Secondly, depending on what action the government takes on the recommendations on this study, it will make it easier for State governments to initiate the process of inclusion if they so decide to do it.

### What next?

While the AnSI and TRIs have completed the ethnographic study, this report remains with the Special Committee headed by the Vice-Chairperson of the NITI Aayog. Officials have said that this committee is now “scrutinising” the recommendations and will soon prepare a final report, on which the Government will take a call.

> Classifying **Denotified Tribes (DNTs)** impacts their **social, economic, and political rights**. Originally labeled as **"criminal tribes"** under British rule, they were **denotified in 1952**, yet continue to face **stigmatization, marginalization, and limited access to welfare schemes**. Classification under **SC, ST, OBC, or separate DNT category** affects **affirmative action, reservations, and development policies**. Fragmented classification leads to **unequal benefits** among DNTs. A **uniform legal framework, targeted welfare policies, and better representation** are needed to **ensure justice, social inclusion, and economic upliftment** of these communities while addressing their **historical injustices and discrimination**.

### **Analysis of WHO’s Guidelines on Lower-Sodium Salt Substitutes**

#### **1. WHO’s New Recommendation on Salt Intake**
- The **World Health Organization (WHO)** has issued guidelines recommending the use of **lower-sodium salt substitutes**.
- These substitutes replace **sodium chloride (NaCl) with potassium chloride (KCl)** to help reduce sodium intake.
- The recommendation is applicable to **adults (excluding pregnant women and children)**.
- Individuals with **kidney impairments or conditions affecting potassium excretion** should **not** consume these substitutes.

---

#### **2. Rationale Behind Salt Reduction**
- **Sodium and water travel together** in the human body; excess sodium leads to **water retention**, increasing **blood pressure**.
- High salt consumption can contribute to **hypertension**, which in turn **increases cardiovascular risks** like heart disease and strokes.
- Lowering salt intake can significantly **reduce blood volume**, leading to **lower blood pressure** and better **heart health**.
- **High sodium intake is linked to 1.9 million deaths annually** from **noncommunicable diseases (NCDs)** such as:
  - **Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs)**
  - **Chronic kidney disease (CKD)**
  - **Gastric cancer**

---

#### **3. Potential Benefits of Using Lower-Sodium Salt Substitutes**
- A **cost-effective and practical approach** to reducing sodium intake at a **population level**.
- Shifts the focus from **individual awareness campaigns** to making **low-sodium salt more accessible and affordable**.
- Helps in **preventing high blood pressure, strokes, and other heart diseases**.
- Provides a **policy framework for governments, healthcare providers, and food industry stakeholders** to implement sodium reduction strategies.

---

#### **4. Concerns & Risks Associated with the Recommendation**
- **Risk for People with Kidney Issues**:
  - Individuals with **undiagnosed kidney disease** might be **adversely affected** by potassium-rich salt substitutes.
  - Excess potassium intake can **worsen kidney function** or lead to **hyperkalemia** (high potassium levels).
- **Limited Applicability**:
  - The guidelines focus only on **household table salt**, not on **packaged or restaurant foods**, which are major contributors to sodium intake.
- **Cultural and Dietary Challenges**:
  - In **India**, high salt consumption is deeply embedded in cooking practices, making **behavioral change difficult**.
  - Awareness and **accessibility of potassium-based salt alternatives** remain key challenges.

---

#### **5. Policy and Implementation Considerations**
- **Policymakers** must ensure that **low-sodium salt substitutes** are **widely available and affordable**.
- Health professionals should **screen individuals for kidney conditions** before recommending **potassium-enriched salt**.
- **Food industry and regulatory bodies** should be encouraged to **reduce sodium content** in **processed and restaurant foods**.
- Public awareness campaigns should be implemented to promote **gradual reduction in salt use** and **healthier cooking habits**.

---

### **Conclusion**
- The **WHO’s lower-sodium salt substitute guidelines** aim to **combat high sodium-related health issues**, especially **hypertension and cardiovascular diseases**.
- **While beneficial for the general population**, they **may pose risks** for people with **kidney disease** or potassium metabolism issues.
- **A balanced approach** is needed—**targeted screening, policy implementation, and public awareness campaigns**—to ensure both **health benefits and safety**.

> The **WHO** recommends **lower-sodium salt substitutes** (potassium chloride replacing sodium chloride) to reduce **high sodium intake**, which contributes to **hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, and kidney disease**. While beneficial in lowering **blood pressure and stroke risks**, these substitutes **exclude pregnant women, children, and individuals with kidney impairments** due to potassium-related health concerns. The guidelines focus on **household salt use**, not **packaged or restaurant foods**. In India, where **high salt consumption is cultural**, accessibility and affordability of substitutes are key. Policymakers must ensure **public awareness, food industry regulation, and medical screening** to balance **health benefits and risks** effectively.

# The U.S.’s immigration blocks as a self-defeating path

What do we see in the bustling corridors of Silicon Valley, the research labs of Boston, and the biotech hubs of San Diego? Skilled immigrants do not just fill jobs; they create them. They launch startups, file patents and drive innovation, expanding the very foundation of American employment.

However, to understand this, we need to challenge our most basic assumptions about how labour markets work in knowledge economies.

The debate over H-1B visas in the United States seems to hinge on a seemingly very intuitive argument: that restricting skilled immigration will translate into more jobs for native workers. On the contrary, extensive research has shown that this approach is flawed and, in fact, counterproductive to innovation and job creation.

### Impact on jobs

A study by Britta Glennon found that in response to increasing H-1B visa restrictions, American companies do not typically hire more U.S. workers. Instead, they just accelerate foreign hiring. This might seem like an unforeseen consequence, but faced with visa restrictions, it is not entirely unthinkable that they will turn to countries with large pools of skilled workers (India and China).

The numbers are very significant. A decrease of 1% in initial employment from the H-1B supply could have an impact in terms of the foreign affiliate growth rate of between 10 and 20%. And it is not just replacement hires. Entire teams and operations could move overseas. For every 10 H-1B positions denied, U.S. multinational firms hire an average of eight foreign workers abroad. Other research shows that each H-1B visa holder creates 1.83 additional jobs for native-born American workers over the next seven years. Immigrant-founded companies in the U.S. have, historically, attracted significant investment, creating jobs at higher rates than native-founded firms. Research by the National Foundation for American Policy shows that more than half of America’s billion-dollar startups have been started by immigrants.

The argument that H-1B workers suppress wages also does not hold up to scrutiny. Research by Giovanni Peri and colleagues has shown that native wages actually rise when foreign science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) workers are hired, by increasing productivity and innovation, particularly in technical fields. Aggregating at the national level, foreign STEM workers flowing in may account for 30% to 50% of the aggregate productivity growth and 4% to 8% of the skill-biased productivity growth. Another report by the American Immigration Council challenges the widespread idea that H-1B workers earn lower wages than their U.S. counterparts, and, therefore, negatively affect wage growth. For instance, it shows that the median wage for H-1B workers was more than double that for the general U.S. workforce in 2021. And between 2003 and 2021, it rose by 52%, while wages for all U.S. workers grew by 39%. Recent studies have shown that knowledge spillovers and productivity gains from high-skilled immigration actually increase native wages. When companies do not face hurdles in hiring the talent they need, they expand operations domestically, which in turn, creates more opportunities for everyone.

A study in the Journal of Labor Economics found that a 10% increase in foreign STEM workers leads to a 0.5% to 0.6% rise in native wages and a 0.3% to 0.7% increase in patents per capita. Research by Jennifer Hunt shows that a 1% increase in immigrant college graduates in the population causes patents per capita to increase by 9% to 18%. Cities with higher concentrations of H-1B workers, such as Silicon Valley, have become global innovation hubs. Up to 71% of tech workers in Silicon Valley are foreign-born, says a report. Restricting this talent flow risks undermining the very foundation of America’s technological leadership.

### ‘Brain circulation’, India’s experience

By some estimates, Indians receive around 70% of H-1B visas annually. This phenomenon, earlier considered to be “brain-drain”, is now being looked at as “brain circulation”, since the experience these Indians receive abroad has significantly bolstered India’s tech sector and innovation ecosystem. Skilled migration benefits both the sending and receiving countries.

Today’s world is highly interconnected. Competition is for both global talent and future innovation hubs. Canada’s success in attracting tech companies through its liberal immigration policies offers a stark warning: when the U.S. restricts skilled immigration, it does not protect jobs. It exports them.

What is the solution? Blanket restrictions will not work. We need nuanced immigration policies that emphasise the complementary relationship between foreign talent and domestic job creation, while also protecting against abuse.

The H-1B visa regime, therefore, needs more, not less, flexibility. Visa caps should be adjusted to reflect market demands. Current fixed caps create artificial scarcity. This restricts the ability of American companies to scale, and, thereby, reduces potential job creation.

Recognising the importance of skilled immigration, fast-track processing mechanisms should be put in place for critical skills, providing dedicated pathways for entrepreneurs who can drive innovation and job creation. Opportunities for permanent residency for STEM graduates which allow for seamless transitions for foreign students trained in US universities will help in this endeavour.

And, finally, labour market modernisation is the need of the hour: transparent wage determinations and real-time analytics to match skills with opportunities will go a long way in matching demand with supply seamlessly.

### A talent flywheel

While the H-1B debate in America unfolds, India needs to be ready to transform its relationship with skilled migration — not merely as a talent exporter, but as a dynamic participant in global innovation networks, where outward mobility generates inward flows of knowledge, capital, and innovation.

This transformation will ultimately rest on three pillars. First, talent is not about building walls, but about creating magnetic poles of innovation. India needs more specialised innovation clusters with global standards, tax incentives, and research grants. Second, India needs to switch gears from playing catch-up to setting new paradigms and creating new global standards. IndiaStack and UPI stand out as shining examples.

Third is the cultivation of a true innovation ecosystem that supports risk-taking and experimentation. A startup visa programme, for instance, could attract global entrepreneurs to build in India.

Implementation requires maintaining a delicate balance between short-term wins, like streamlined OCI processes and pension portability agreements, and long-term transformation, such as automated talent mobility systems, joint research funding, shared patent applications and technology transfer agreements.

### The core principle to remember is that talent mobility is not a zero-sum game.

> The U.S.'s stringent immigration restrictions are counterproductive, as they hinder economic growth and innovation. Immigrants significantly contribute to the labor force, tax revenues, and consumer demand. Policies like mass deportations can lead to labor shortages, especially in sectors such as agriculture and construction, resulting in higher production costs and inflation. Economists warn that such measures could slow economic growth, given the vital role immigration plays in labor force expansion amid declining birth rates and an aging population. Therefore, restrictive immigration policies may offer short-term benefits but ultimately undermine the nation's long-term prosperity.

# The Annual Status of Education Report-2024 (ASER-Rural) released on Tuesday

At the heart of the current Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) outbreak in Pune, where over **100 cases** of suspected GBS have been recorded, is a bacterial infection. A health investigation has revealed **Campylobacter jejuni**, a bacteria found in contaminated food and water, to be behind the first cluster of cases. In almost all the patients, recent case history has shown episodes of gastroenteritis, vomiting, diarrhoea and nausea before the onset of the characteristic peripheral numbing of GBS, leading to paralysis. One case of death due to suspected GBS has also been recorded — of a patient who had visited Pune. This outbreak reveals the fragility of the scaffolding that urban systems in India are built on, with pathogens managing to breach all safety nets that humans have built for themselves, to emerge through and cause havoc. Any slip up in maintenance or in surveillance, clearly leads to discomfort, ill health and debility for a large number of people. GBS is a rare, autoimmune neurological disorder, in which a person’s immune system launches an attack on the peripheral nervous system, leading to tingling, weakening of muscles, numbing and paralysis in the arms and legs, not unlike in the acute flaccid paralysis of polio. It can be caused by viral or bacterial pre-infections, as per the World Health Organization (WHO). Globally, it is estimated that GBS has an incidence of 1-2 per 1,00,000 population, and is more predominant among adult males. While India-specific large epidemiological studies on GBS are lacking, as testing for GBS in a resource-poor setting is difficult, according to a WHO report (1993), it was estimated that 138 cases of GBS were seen annually in seven major teaching hospitals, with approximately 75% of cases occurring in adults. While studies across the world have shown numbers to rise in seasons of weather change, it is possible that this is India’s largest outbreak in recorded history.

Patients are treated with plasma exchange or intravenous **immunoglobulin therapy**, and most recover. However, these treatments are most effective if started within two weeks of the first symptoms, making early detection and initiation of treatment absolutely crucial. Rapid response teams in Pune are in place, collecting water samples and mounting surveillance on the community, and a central team has also been rushed to affected areas. It is key to ensure that all measures are in place to pick up patients, and initiate treatment as soon as possible. It is the duty of the local and State governance to provide clean drinking water to all residents and ensure that adequate social messaging is provided periodically on avoiding contaminated, unhygienic food.

> The **GBS outbreak in Pune** highlights the importance of **hygiene to prevent infections** that may trigger Guillain-Barré Syndrome. Key preventive measures include **regular handwashing**, **using sanitizers**, and **avoiding raw or undercooked food**, especially poultry. Drinking **boiled or treated water** is crucial to prevent waterborne infections. **Avoid touching the face with unwashed hands**, and refrain from sharing personal items. Early symptoms like **muscle weakness, tingling, or numbness** require immediate medical attention. Proper **food safety, sanitation, and hygiene practices** can help minimize the risk of infections that may contribute to GBS. **Staying informed and proactive** is essential during this outbreak.

# The Annual Status of Education Report-2024 (ASER-Rural) released on Tuesday

The Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2024, released on January 28, 2025, provides a comprehensive analysis of the current state of education in rural India. Conducted by the non-profit organization Pratham, ASER is a nationwide household survey that assesses children's enrollment and foundational learning outcomes across rural districts.

**Survey Scope and Methodology**

The 2024 survey encompassed 17,997 villages across 605 rural districts, evaluating 649,491 children aged 3 to 16. The assessment focused on reading and arithmetic skills among over 500,000 children aged 5 to 16. 

**Key Findings**

1. **Improvement in Foundational Skills**:
   - *Reading Proficiency*: The percentage of Class 5 children in government schools who can read a Class 2-level text increased to 44.8% in 2024, up from 38.5% in 2022, nearly matching the 2018 rate of 44.2%. In private schools, this figure rose to 59.3% in 2024 from 56.8% in 2022, though still below the 2018 level of 65.1%. 
   - *Arithmetic Skills*: For Class 3 students, the ability to perform basic subtraction improved to 33.7% in 2024 from 25.9% in 2022, surpassing the pre-pandemic level of 28.2% in 2018. Government schools saw a 7% increase, while private schools experienced a 4% rise in this competency.
2. **Enrollment Trends**:
   - The proportion of children aged 6 to 14 enrolled in government schools decreased to 69.9% in 2024 from 72.9% in 2022, indicating a shift back towards private schooling as incomes recover post-pandemic. 

3. **School Attendance**:
   - Average student attendance in government elementary schools increased to 75.9% in 2024 from 73% in 2022 and 72.4% in 2018. Teacher attendance also saw a rise, reaching 87.5% in 2024 compared to 86.8% in 2022 and 85.1% in 2018. 
4. **Digital Access and Usage**:
   - Approximately 90% of children aged 14 to 16 reported having a smartphone at home, with 82.2% indicating they know how to use one. However, only 57% utilized these devices for educational purposes, while 76% used them for social media. Notably, 36.2% of boys and 26.9% of girls owned personal smartphones, highlighting a gender disparity in device ownership. 

5. **School Infrastructure**:
   - The prevalence of small schools increased, with 52.1% of government primary schools reporting less than 60 enrolled students in 2024, up from 44% in 2022. Additionally, two-thirds of Class 1 and Class 2 classrooms were multigrade, accommodating students from different grades together.
6. **Pre-Primary Education**:
   - States such as Karnataka, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Kerala, and Nagaland reported enrollment rates above 90% for five-year-old children in pre-primary education. 

**Implications and Observations**

The significant improvements in foundational reading and arithmetic skills suggest a positive impact from initiatives like the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, which emphasizes foundational literacy and numeracy. ASER Centre Director Wilima Wadhwa noted, "We have not seen improvements of this magnitude in the last 20 years since ASER has been presenting data on foundational reading and arithmetic. Everything seems to point towards NEP 2020 and its focus on foundational skills." 

Despite these gains, challenges persist, including disparities in learning outcomes across states, gender gaps in digital access, and the increasing prevalence of small, multigrade classrooms. These findings underscore the need for continued focus on equitable resource distribution, targeted interventions, and infrastructure development to sustain and further the progress in rural education.
