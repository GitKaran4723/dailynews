# Why has Trump called the Panama treaty ‘foolish’?

![image_name](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ZtfA9e960hdBroBqOGbUU32znAKd8Ab0)

President-elect Donald Trump recently labeled the 1977 Torrijos–Carter Treaties, which transferred control of the Panama Canal from the United States to Panama by 1999, as "foolish." He argues that the U.S. relinquished a strategic asset, leading to increased transit fees for American vessels and potential Chinese influence over canal operations. Trump has expressed concerns over rising fees imposed by the Panama Canal Authority, viewing them as detrimental to U.S. economic interests. Additionally, he perceives China's growing presence in Panama, including investments near the canal, as a threat to U.S. national security. In response, Trump has suggested the possibility of reclaiming control over the canal, even hinting at military action, to safeguard American interests. 

Panama's President José Raúl Mulino has firmly rejected Trump's assertions, reaffirming Panama's sovereignty over the canal and denying any undue Chinese influence. He emphasized that the canal operates under established international rules, ensuring neutrality and equal treatment for vessels from all nations. 

The Torrijos–Carter Treaties were initially controversial in the U.S., with critics arguing that ceding control was a strategic mistake. However, the treaties were designed to promote fairness and international cooperation, ensuring the canal's neutrality and accessibility. Since the handover, Panama has successfully managed the canal, maintaining its status as a vital conduit for global trade. 

Trump's recent statements have sparked nationalist sentiments in Panama, with citizens and leaders expressing strong opposition to any reversal of the 1999 transfer treaty. Demonstrations have taken place, emphasizing Panama's commitment to its sovereignty and control over the canal.

> Donald Trump recently called the 1977 Panama Canal Treaty "foolish," criticizing the U.S. for surrendering control and citing rising transit fees and increasing Chinese influence in Panama.

# Sivagiri row: what is the outrage about?

### **Analysis of the Debate on Sanatana Dharma and Caste System**

Kerala Chief Minister **Pinarayi Vijayan**’s remarks equating **Sanatana Dharma** with **Varnashrama Dharma** have sparked significant political and social debate. He criticized attempts to portray **Sree Narayana Guru** as a proponent of Sanatana Dharma, arguing that it contradicts the Guru's efforts to dismantle the **caste system** and promote **social equality**.

---

### **Understanding Sanatana Dharma and Varnashrama Dharma**

- **Sanatana Dharma** is often interpreted as the eternal and universal principles of Hinduism, encompassing spiritual practices, moral values, and traditions.  
- **Varnashrama Dharma** refers to the traditional social order in Hindu society, which classifies individuals into four **varnas (castes)** based on occupation and birth. Over time, this system led to rigid caste hierarchies and social discrimination, particularly against **Dalits** and **lower castes**.

Vijayan argued that Sanatana Dharma, in practice, often aligns with Varnashrama Dharma, perpetuating caste-based oppression, especially in rural northern India. He suggested that glorifying Sanatana Dharma without addressing its role in sustaining caste divisions contradicts the values of **social justice** and **humanism** that leaders like Sree Narayana Guru championed.

---

### **Political Reactions**

The **Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)** swiftly condemned Vijayan's remarks. Former Union Minister **V. Muraleedharan** accused the Chief Minister of disrespecting Sanatana Dharma, drawing parallels with Tamil Nadu’s Deputy CM **Udhayanidhi Stalin**, who had previously criticized the doctrine.  

This controversy reflects broader ideological conflicts between progressive, **anti-caste** movements and traditionalist interpretations of Hinduism, especially in political narratives. The debate highlights ongoing tensions between advocating for **social reform** and preserving **religious traditions**.

---

### **About Sree Narayana Guru**

**Sree Narayana Guru (1856–1928)** was a revered **social reformer**, **spiritual leader**, and **philosopher** from Kerala, known for his relentless efforts to eradicate the **caste system** and promote **social equality**.

#### **Key Contributions:**

1. **Fight Against Caste Discrimination:**  
   - Born into the marginalized **Ezhava** community, Narayana Guru challenged the **Brahmanical orthodoxy** that enforced caste hierarchies.  
   - He advocated for the dignity and rights of oppressed communities, emphasizing **education** and **economic empowerment**.  

2. **Spiritual and Religious Reforms:**  
   - Guru consecrated temples open to all, breaking caste barriers in religious practices.  
   - His famous consecration of the **Shiva temple at Aruvippuram** in 1888 was a symbolic act against caste-based religious exclusion.  
   - His philosophy, "**One Caste, One Religion, One God for Humanity**," underscored his commitment to **social harmony**.  

3. **Promotion of Education and Social Upliftment:**  
   - He established the **Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana (SNDP) Yogam** in 1903 to uplift marginalized communities through **education**, **social reforms**, and **economic development**.  

4. **Literary Works:**  
   - Narayana Guru composed profound literary works in **Malayalam**, **Sanskrit**, and **Tamil**, promoting spiritual wisdom and social reform.  
   - His poems and writings stressed **universal love**, **human dignity**, and **spiritual freedom**.  

5. **Role in Kerala Renaissance:**  
   - He was a leading figure in the **Kerala Renaissance**, a socio-cultural movement that challenged social inequalities and laid the foundation for Kerala's progressive society.

---

### **Conclusion**

The debate over **Sanatana Dharma** and its association with caste practices reflects deep-rooted ideological and political divisions in India. While some view Sanatana Dharma as a spiritual path promoting universal values, others criticize its historical role in perpetuating the **caste system**.  

**Sree Narayana Guru’s** life and work stand as a testament to the struggle against caste oppression and the pursuit of social equality. Associating him with traditionalist religious frameworks risks misrepresenting his **humanist ideals** and **anti-caste activism**.  

This ongoing discourse underscores the importance of interpreting religious traditions in ways that uphold **social justice**, **equality**, and **human dignity**.
