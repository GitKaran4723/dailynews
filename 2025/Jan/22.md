# Trump effectively pulls U.S. out of global corporate tax deal

### **History and Impact of the Global Corporate Minimum Tax Deal**

---

### **Historical Background**

1. **The 2021 Agreement:**
   - Negotiated under the aegis of the **Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)**, the global corporate minimum tax deal aimed to address tax avoidance by multinational corporations.
   - Nearly **140 countries**, including the U.S., agreed to a **15% global minimum corporate tax rate** to curb profit shifting to low-tax jurisdictions (tax havens).
   - The deal had two pillars:
     - **Pillar One:** Reallocate taxing rights, allowing countries to tax a share of profits from multinational corporations operating within their borders, even without physical presence.
     - **Pillar Two:** Impose a global minimum tax of 15% to reduce tax competition and ensure a level playing field.

2. **Purpose of the Deal:**
   - Address global tax inequities caused by multinational corporations exploiting loopholes and shifting profits to low-tax jurisdictions.
   - Prevent a "race to the bottom," where countries reduce tax rates to attract businesses.
   - Generate additional tax revenues to fund public spending.

3. **U.S. Involvement:**
   - The Biden administration was a key driver of the agreement, advocating for it as part of its domestic and international tax reforms.
   - Congressional hurdles delayed U.S. implementation, despite international commitment.

---

### **Trump’s Declaration and Its Impact**

1. **Withdrawal Announcement:**
   - Former President Donald Trump’s declaration that the global tax deal “has no force or effect” in the U.S. signals a significant policy shift and undermines the agreement.

2. **Immediate Consequences:**
   - **Global Disruption:** U.S. withdrawal weakens the agreement, as its success hinges on widespread implementation by major economies.
   - **Corporate Implications:** U.S.-based multinationals may face uncertainties, as other countries might impose unilateral taxes or retaliatory measures.
   - **Reduced Global Cooperation:** Undermines multilateral efforts to address tax avoidance, potentially sparking trade and tax conflicts.

---

### **Economic and Political Implications**

1. **For the U.S.:**
   - **Loss of Leadership:** The withdrawal diminishes the U.S.'s role as a leader in global tax reform.
   - **Tax Competition:** U.S. companies could exploit lower rates abroad, exacerbating profit shifting and reducing U.S. tax revenues.
   - **Domestic Tax Policy:** Conflicts with President Biden’s vision of equitable taxation and reform.

2. **For the Global Economy:**
   - **Weakened Implementation:** The absence of U.S. participation undermines enforcement, encouraging countries to prioritize unilateral measures.
   - **Erosion of Revenue Gains:** Developing nations, which expected increased tax revenues under the deal, face setbacks in funding public services.
   - **Renewed Tax Wars:** The lack of coordinated action could lead to retaliatory taxes and disputes.

3. **Geopolitical Dynamics:**
   - **EU and OECD Challenges:** The withdrawal may strain relations between the U.S., the EU, and OECD nations, with the latter likely to push forward without U.S. participation.
   - **China’s Role:** U.S. disengagement could open opportunities for China to assert greater influence over global tax norms.

---

### **Conclusion**

The U.S.'s withdrawal from the global corporate minimum tax deal marks a major disruption to efforts aimed at establishing a fair and coordinated global tax system. It weakens multilateral cooperation, affects global economic stability, and undermines the deal’s goals of curbing tax avoidance and ensuring equitable tax revenue distribution. Moving forward, the international community may face increased challenges in addressing global tax inequities without the participation of the world’s largest economy.

> The U.S.’s withdrawal from the global corporate minimum tax deal, declared by former President Trump, disrupts a landmark 2021 agreement negotiated under the OECD with 140 nations. The deal, aimed at curbing tax avoidance, proposed a 15% global minimum tax and reallocated taxing rights to address profit shifting to low-tax jurisdictions. U.S. withdrawal undermines its implementation, weakens multilateral cooperation, and may lead to trade and tax disputes. Developing nations face setbacks in expected revenue gains, while U.S. leadership in global tax reform diminishes. The move risks renewed tax competition and erodes efforts toward a fair and coordinated global tax system.

   - Subnational efforts in the U.S., such as state-level initiatives and private sector commitments, partially mitigated the impact.

---

### **Conclusion**
Trump’s exit from the Paris Agreement undermined global efforts to combat climate change, weakened renewable energy momentum, and created financial and leadership gaps. However, other nations and U.S. subnational actors continued advancing renewable energy, highlighting resilience in global climate action. Rejoining the Paris Agreement under subsequent administrations, such as Biden’s, was critical to restoring U.S. leadership and reinvigorating international cooperation on renewable energy and climate goals.

> The Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015, aims to limit global warming below 2°C by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting renewable energy. President Trump’s 2017 decision to withdraw the U.S. weakened global climate action, disrupted financial contributions to the Green Climate Fund, and slowed renewable energy progress. Domestically, Trump’s policies favored fossil fuels, rolling back clean energy incentives. This withdrawal undermined U.S. leadership, delayed global climate goals, and shifted influence to countries like China and the EU. However, global renewable energy markets remained resilient, with subnational U.S. efforts partially mitigating the impact. Rejoining the agreement under Biden revitalized global cooperation.

# What is the status of the Smart Cities Mission?

Almost a decade has passed since the Indian government announced the concept of “smart cities” as the new lighthouses of urbanisation. The June 2015 announcement of 100 smart cities aimed to create models of urban development. However, these lighthouses of urbanity have now been relegated to the annals of India’s urbanisation history.

### What went wrong with smart cities?

The smart cities initiative was based on the Internet of Things (IoT), a framework that works well in advanced capitalist countries where basic utilities are already in place. In contrast, in India, where basic services are still out of reach for many, “smart cities” essentially mean providing fundamental amenities to residents. The plan included two key components — pan-city proposals which includes IT-enabled services like mobility and waste management; and Area-Based Development (ABD) which was restricted to specific zones within a city, focusing on retrofitting, redevelopment, and greenfield projects. Additionally, governance of these projects bypassed local governments, relying instead on Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) registered under the Companies Act, and managed like private companies. City councils were excluded, based on the assumption that private company-like structures could deliver better results.

### What happened in Shimla?

Shimla was not included in the initial list of smart cities. However, after legal challenges posed by Shimla in the Himachal Pradesh High Court, Shimla was also granted the smart city tag.

Shimla’s smart city plan adhered to guidelines, including pan-city initiatives and ABD projects. The city had proposed a mix of retrofit and redevelopment projects within ABD. The retrofit project had targeted improving city wide pedestrian crossings, vehicular mobility on circular roads, and three transport corridors in addition to underground ducting and parking provision. Additional features were also added that included eco-adventure tourism, and water security through storm water and spring water management. A total of 244 acres of land was supposed to be retrofitted. Redevelopment projects focused on Lower Bazar, Ganj Bazar, and Krishnanagar. The aim was to replace dilapidated, unsafe buildings with modern, resilient, earthquake-safe structures that could boost tourism.

The total estimated investment for Shimla was ₹2,906 crore, with funding sources as follows — ₹897.80 crore from Public-Private Partnerships (PPP); ₹101.77 crore through municipal bonds; ₹205.57 crore from external borrowings; and ₹348.49 crore from State and Union government schemes, and the rest from other sources. However, as of now, according to the Smart City dashboard, only ₹707 crore (24% of the original budget) has been spent: ₹53 crore on completed projects and ₹654 crore on ongoing ones. The proposed PPP contribution has not yet materialised.

### What has been the outcome?

None of the funds have been utilised for the redevelopment of the Lower Bazar, Middle Bazar, or Krishnanagar. Traffic congestion has worsened, and despite initial plans, non-motorised mobility remains neglected. Instead, funds were spent on flower pots worth ₹2 crore. Moreover, large, visually intrusive structures were erected for escalators that remain non-operational, obstructing Shimla’s iconic valley views.

As the Smart City Mission approaches its final chapter, the lessons are glaringly evident. Projects devoid of meaningful urban governance and public involvement, are bound to fail. With no ownership or accountability, the smart city vision has faded into oblivion.

> The **Smart Cities Mission (SCM)**, launched in 2015, aims to develop 100 citizen-friendly, sustainable urban centers in India. As of December 2024, 7,380 of 8,075 projects (worth ₹147,704 crores) have been completed, with the mission extended to March 2025 to ensure full implementation. Cities like Madurai have achieved 100% completion, while others, particularly in northeastern and hilly areas, lag with 16–39% progress. Challenges include administrative delays and coordination issues. Despite setbacks, the mission has demonstrated significant progress, with ₹46,585 crores of central funds disbursed, and is expected to further transform India's urban landscape by its revised deadline.

# Trump 2.0 as disruptor of the global legal order

Donald Trump’s second term as President of the United States marks the start of a new ‘Trumpian’ era, defined by his leadership. Foreign policy experts expect that Mr. Trump will continue to embody the image of a disruptor. The international legal order is expected to experience substantial changes.

As the leading global power of our time, the U.S. has always maintained a complicated relationship with international law. The U.S. has played a vital role in establishing many key institutions and frameworks within international law, as well as in shaping their norms, priorities and agendas to align with American interests. This influence is evident across various areas of international law, including climate change law, space law, human rights law, and trade and investment law. At the same time, America has often followed a policy of exceptionalism, i.e., an attitude of being ‘distinct’ and thus an ‘exception’ to the law that binds all other nations. Thus, the U.S. has been criticised for violating or sidelining the same norms and institutions of international law that it helped create and expects other countries to follow.

### The Trump 1.0 years

While this has been the case for many American presidencies, the Trump Presidency took it to a completely different level, almost waging a war on international law. Elected with the slogan of “America First”, Mr. Trump’s first term reflected what international law scholars Oona Hathaway and Scott Shapiro call a ‘sovereigntist view of international law’ which often misconceives entering into multilateral treaties as putting unacceptable limits on sovereign authority. Mr. Trump’s first term was marked by scepticism towards multilateralism and a preference for bilateralism, which is usually the case of emerging revisionist powers but strange for the incumbent superpower.

Accordingly, the Trump administration, in June 2017, famously walked away from the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Washington also reneged on a key nuclear treaty with Russia and a nuclear deal with Iran. Mr. Trump also posed major challenges to the international trade regime by using tariffs and other protectionist measures, including against allied countries.

He continued blocking appointments into the World Trade Organization (WTO)’s Dispute Settlement Body’s Appellate Body, which ultimately led to the organ becoming dysfunctional. Under his presidency, the U.S. withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement that the Obama administration had so assiduously crafted and put an end to the North American Free Trade Agreement or NAFTA and negotiating a new trade agreement. Additionally, during the Trump first term, the U.S. withdrew from several international institutions such as the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), attempted to withdraw from the World Health Organization (WHO), and threatened withdrawal from the WTO.

### Another onslaught

Mr. Trump’s return to the White House could accelerate the weakening of the normative authority of multilateral institutions. While the U.S. rejoined many of the multilateral institutions under the Biden administration, it might again disengage from them. In fact, within hours of his inauguration, he reportedly signed executive orders initiating the U.S.’s withdrawal from WHO and the Paris Agreement. Mr. Trump has announced fresh plans to pursue unilateralism by raising tariffs, even if it triggers a trade war and violates WTO rules.

He has already announced that he may impose a 25% tariff on imports from Mexico and Canada. His belligerent onslaught on the Washington Consensus-based international trade and investment law model will continue unabated. Any hopes of the Global South of reviving the WTO’s dysfunctional Appellate Body should be abandoned. While some hoped that Mr. Trump’s policies may translate into renewed U.S. isolationism and less interventionism, his recent statements belie such hopes.

His plans to annex Greenland and the Panama Canal, refusing to rule out coercive methods to do so, and include Canada as the 51st State of the U.S., are reminiscent of the 18th-19th century era of great powers acquiring sovereign territories through conquest and gunboat diplomacy. In the post-UN charter era, which considers the prohibition of using force and self-determination as central tenets, such ambitions may embolden other revisionist states such as China and Russia to embark on similar quests for obtaining territory.

As scholars such as Marko Milanović have pointed out, even if Mr. Trump ultimately does not use force, these statements potentially violate the norm of non-intervention under Article 2(7) of the UN Charter, further challenging the international order. The statements made by his allies, such as Elon Musk (who is part of the Trump administration), commenting on the internal politics and laws of allied countries such as the United Kingdom and Germany, have also irked many and could be construed as unacceptable intervention.

### Other nations and the legal order

International lawyer Harold Koh has pointed out that the participants involved in the ‘transnational legal process’, including many officials within the U.S. itself, were able to blunt many of Mr. Trump’s policies in his first term, particularly those affecting international law. However, with Mr. Trump’s renewed majority and control over both the Senate and the House, it is more likely that he will be able to push forward his policies more effectively. In that case, other countries must cooperate to preserve the international legal order.

> Trump's potential return as U.S. President, often dubbed "Trump 2.0," could disrupt the global legal order through his "America First" policies and disregard for multilateral frameworks. His past actions, like withdrawing from international agreements (e.g., Paris Climate Accord, Iran Nuclear Deal) and undermining global institutions (e.g., NATO, WTO), signal a preference for unilateralism over cooperation. Threats to impose tariffs, weaken alliances, and disregard international norms could exacerbate global instability. Such actions may challenge the rules-based international order, strain U.S. alliances, and embolden authoritarian regimes, altering global power dynamics and undermining collective problem-solving on issues like climate change and security.

---

### **Conclusion**
The U.S.-India nuclear deal is a transformative agreement with profound strategic, economic, and geopolitical implications. While it faced criticism for challenging non-proliferation norms, it enabled India to access nuclear technology and fuel, bolstering its energy security and global standing. For the U.S., the deal strengthened ties with a key ally in the Indo-Pacific, advancing shared interests in a dynamic global order. Despite challenges in implementation, the agreement remains a cornerstone of the U.S.-India partnership.

> The U.S.-India Nuclear Deal (2008) marked a transformative milestone in bilateral relations, granting India access to nuclear technology and fuel despite being a non-signatory to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). India agreed to separate its civilian and military nuclear facilities, placing civilian reactors under IAEA safeguards. The deal bolstered India’s energy security, enhanced its global standing, and opened opportunities for nuclear trade and technology. For the U.S., it deepened ties with India as a strategic partner in the Indo-Pacific and counterbalanced China's influence. Despite challenges like liability issues and non-proliferation concerns, the agreement remains pivotal in U.S.-India cooperation.

# Trump declares end to U.S. citizenship by birth

This scenario raises significant concerns for U.S.-India relations and has far-reaching implications in various dimensions, including economic, diplomatic, and societal aspects. Let's break down the analysis:

---

### **1. Impact on Indian Professionals and Families**
- **Revoking Birthright Citizenship:** The cancellation of citizenship by birth directly affects Indian professionals in the U.S. on H-1B and other temporary visas. These professionals, who aspire to settle in the U.S., may face uncertainty regarding their children's legal status.
  - **Brain Drain Reversal:** This policy could lead to a decline in the attractiveness of the U.S. for Indian talent, potentially redirecting skilled workers to other countries like Canada or Australia, which offer more favorable immigration policies.
  - **Impact on the U.S. Economy:** Indian professionals, especially in the tech sector, have been vital to the U.S. economy. This move may discourage new talent from seeking opportunities in the U.S., leading to labor shortages in key sectors.

---

### **2. Economic Tensions: BRICS Tariffs**
- **100% Tariffs on BRICS Nations:** Imposing hefty tariffs on BRICS nations for transitioning to non-dollar transactions could severely impact trade relations with India, which is a major U.S. trading partner.
  - **India’s Economic Stance:** India has been working to diversify its trade dependencies, including exploring non-dollar mechanisms for trade settlements with countries like Russia and China. The tariff threat could disrupt this strategy and create friction in India-U.S. economic ties.
  - **Mutual Loss:** High tariffs could hurt U.S. exports to India, particularly in defense and technology sectors, while increasing costs for Indian imports of American goods like machinery, medical equipment, and oil.

---

### **3. Diplomatic Fallout**
- **Immigration Crackdown:** The deportation of undocumented immigrants, including over 7.25 lakh Indians, can strain people-to-people ties. India, which has consistently engaged with the U.S. on immigration matters, may view such actions as unfriendly, potentially leading to diplomatic friction.
- **Public Perception in India:** Anti-immigration policies and perceived hostility may generate negative public sentiment towards the U.S., undermining the goodwill cultivated over decades.
- **Misrepresentation of BRICS:** The erroneous inclusion of Spain as a BRICS member reflects a lack of awareness, potentially embarrassing the U.S. and undermining the credibility of its policy decisions in the eyes of Indian policymakers.

---

### **4. Broader Implications for U.S.-India Relations**
- **Strategic Partnership at Risk:** India and the U.S. have a growing strategic partnership, particularly in defense, counter-terrorism, and Indo-Pacific security. Policies perceived as anti-India could weaken trust and cooperation.
- **Global Leadership and Alliances:** India is a significant player in global geopolitics and a key partner for the U.S. in counterbalancing China's influence. Alienating India could push it closer to other global powers like Russia or China, counteracting U.S. interests.

---

### **Way Forward**
- **Balanced Immigration Policies:** The U.S. should aim for reforms that address immigration concerns without disproportionately impacting skilled workers and their families.
- **Avoid Protectionism:** Diplomatic engagement is critical to resolving trade and currency disputes, and tariffs should not be used as a punitive measure against strategic partners.
- **Strengthening Strategic Ties:** Both nations must continue to prioritize shared interests, such as technology, security, and climate change, to mitigate the impact of policy disagreements.

---

### **Conclusion**
While the policies outlined in the scenario reflect a hardline stance, they risk straining the mutually beneficial U.S.-India relationship. A pragmatic and collaborative approach would be essential to preserve and strengthen the economic and strategic partnership between the two nations.

> The proposed U.S. policies, including revoking birthright citizenship, high tariffs on BRICS nations, and immigration crackdowns, could strain U.S.-India relations. Revoking birthright citizenship impacts Indian professionals in the U.S., discouraging talent migration and potentially affecting the U.S. economy. High tariffs on BRICS nations for non-dollar transactions could harm trade relations, while the deportation of undocumented Indians may strain people-to-people ties and diplomatic goodwill. Such measures risk undermining the growing strategic partnership between the two nations, especially in defense and Indo-Pacific security. To maintain strong relations, the U.S. must adopt balanced immigration and trade policies, ensuring mutual economic and strategic benefits.
