# Declining fertility levels push up Kerala’s maternal mortality ratio

### **Analysis of the Rising Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) in Kerala**

Kerala, known for its exemplary healthcare system, has historically maintained the **lowest Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR)** in India. However, recent trends indicate a **steady increase** in the MMR, rising from **19** (as per the Sample Registration System 2018–20) to **29** (as per the Kerala Health Department). This unexpected rise, despite the state’s nearly **100% institutional deliveries**, has raised concerns within the State Health Department.

---

### **Key Factors Behind the Rising MMR**

1. **Decline in Birth Rates (Denominator Effect):**  
   - The **number of live births** in Kerala has drastically dropped from **5–5.5 lakh annually** to around **3.4–3.9 lakh**.  
   - This significant reduction in the number of births has **inflated the MMR**, even though the absolute number of maternal deaths has not increased substantially.  
   - The **mathematical formula** for MMR is:  
     \[
     \text{MMR} = \left( \frac{\text{Maternal Deaths}}{\text{Live Births}} \right) \times 100,000
     \]  
     With a lower number of live births, even a small number of maternal deaths can raise the MMR.

2. **Impact of COVID-19:**  
   - During **2020–21**, the COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately affected pregnant women, contributing to increased maternal deaths.  
   - While the immediate COVID-19 impact has reduced, its after-effects may have stressed healthcare resources, indirectly affecting maternal care.  

3. **Demographic Transition:**  
   - Kerala is experiencing an **aging population** and **declining fertility rates**, reflecting a demographic shift.  
   - Delayed pregnancies and increasing maternal age can lead to higher **pregnancy-related complications** and **high-risk pregnancies**.  

4. **Lifestyle and Health Factors:**  
   - Rising cases of **non-communicable diseases (NCDs)** such as diabetes, hypertension, and obesity among women of reproductive age contribute to high-risk pregnancies.  
   - **Lifestyle changes** and delayed motherhood have increased pregnancy complications, leading to maternal health risks.  

5. **Healthcare System Strain:**  
   - While Kerala boasts a robust healthcare system, challenges like **resource allocation**, **healthcare worker shortages**, and **overburdened hospitals** may affect maternal care, especially in rural areas.  

---

# Draft digital data protection rules and authoritarianism

In August 2024, as India marked six years since the K.S. Puttaswamy judgment reaffirmed privacy as a fundamental right, the Internet Freedom Foundation hosted its annual “Privacy Supreme” event — not as a celebration, but as a sombre reflection on its unfulfilled promise. Social activist Nikhil Dey shared chilling accounts, from Ajmer in Rajasthan, on how Aadhaar, heralded for efficiency, has excluded vulnerable residents from pensions and rations. This grim reality must be central to tech policy discussions, including the Draft Digital Data Protection Rules, 2025.

### Executive overreach, scant transparency

Rulemaking typically fleshes out legislation, ensuring laws passed by Parliament are enforceable while maintaining administrative flexibility. Yet, the draft Data Protection Rules provoke concern on questions of executive overreach and vague governance. Some earlier analysis here bears repetition for these rules are a conscientious pupil in obedience of its master. Here, its parent is the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, that was rammed through Parliament as “a product of the subversion of the democratic process”. There is more than a mere lack of trust in how the law was created, for its substantive provisions advance a broader policy of “total state control — a digital leash to yank us and make us stand in line than to serve the preambular objectives of the Constitution of India”. Its provisions are deliberately vague, granting broad discretion under the nebulous phrase “as may be prescribed”.

Despite the Act’s swift passage on August 9, 2023, its implementation remains in limbo. Sixteen months later, the draft Rules have been unveiled for consultation. But are they truly “public”? Published as a 51-page pdf (in Hindi/English as a gazette notification), with a three-page explanatory note that reads as AI glop, a simplistic and vague summary offers little insight into the policy choices during drafting. Comments can only be submitted through the MyGov platform that might encourage expert input but restricts broader participation. Transparency is undermined by the government’s decision to treat submissions as fiduciary, precluding public disclosure and counter-comments. This controlled feedback process resembles a “corporate consultation” rather than a public one.

Substantively, the Data Protection Rules build on a framework of intentional vagueness and executive dominance. Many compliance obligations are either self-determined by companies handling personal data or left to government discretion. Consider Rule 3, which governs consent notices. It mandates “clear and plain language” but fails to define these terms, leaving interpretation subject to India’s vast linguistic and comprehension diversity. Without specific standards, notices risk being overly generic or oversimplified, omitting critical details. Similarly, while the Rules require an “itemized description” of data, they do not clarify whether the disclosure is for categories such as financial or health data; or to specific data points such as account numbers, or even metadata and inferred data. Nor do they define timelines for data breach notifications to users, raising risks for individuals in urgent situations. Such ambiguities, if purely administrative, should have been resolved by the standard setting powers of an independent regulatory authority that does not exist.

### No independence for Data Protection Board

The vagueness reflects deeper structural flaws. The Act eschews the creation of an independent regulatory body, instead, consolidating power within the Union Government. Through informal interactions and gazette notifications, the government wields unchecked authority over citizens and the digital marketplace. Even the Data Protection Board (DPB), which has a limited ambit of jurisdiction to adjudicate on breaches, lacks independence. The Board’s chairperson is selected based on recommendations of a search and selection committee chaired by the Cabinet Secretary, raising critical concerns. How will the committee address the critiques of political control that plague similar appointment processes? What value does the search committee offer when it has advance knowledge that its recommendations are not binding on the Union Government?

Even after its formation, the DPB is hamstrung. Its authority is largely limited to determining data breaches, and its independence is compromised by service conditions of its members to central government employees. This contravenes long-standing recommendations, such as the 2006 Planning Commission consultation paper on regulation, which emphasised that “the selection, appointment, and removal of chairpersons and members should be insulated against any perceived interference or manipulation that may influence the outcome”. How will a subservient DPB apply data protection effectively? Rule 5 exempts data processing for subsidies from consent requirements. In such cases, can there be any meaningful accountability? It is not unreasonable to foresee scenarios where the DPB may fail to act promptly or effectively, particularly when complaints involve powerful government entities such as the UIDAI that handles Aadhaar. It raises fundamental doubts about what it means for community organisations that may approach it for redress on user rights for things as simple as getting a data record corrected to receive rations.

Finally, regarding Rule 22, which contains the power of the government to requisition information, there is an absence of limitations and safeguards. As many may read this column, they may still wonder why the data protection rules are too late, too little, too vague? The answer may be provided by Mr. Dey who framed his characterisation of the digital policies of the Indian state with a reference to Through the Looking-Glass. When Alice probes Humpty Dumpty on how the same word can have different meanings, his reply captures the core of India’s data protection regime: “The question is… which is to be master — that’s all.”

> Draft **Digital Data Protection Rules** aim to regulate the collection, storage, and processing of personal data, ensuring user privacy and data security. However, concerns arise over potential **authoritarian misuse**, as broad surveillance powers and vague provisions could enable **state overreach** and infringe on individual freedoms. Lack of transparency, minimal oversight, and exemptions for government agencies may threaten **freedom of speech**, **privacy rights**, and **digital autonomy**. Balancing **data protection** with **civil liberties** is crucial to prevent authoritarian practices while safeguarding personal data in the digital age.

# Should voter IDs be linked with Aadhaar?

The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have accused each other of manipulating electoral rolls before the Delhi Assembly elections. This has reignited the debate about linking voter IDs/Election Photo Identity Card (EPIC) with respective Aadhaar numbers.

### What is the history of the proposal?

The Election Commission (EC) had in February 2015 launched the National Electoral Rolls Purification and Authentication Program (NERPAP). This was to address the issue of duplicate entries in the electoral roll and to remove such entries. In order to achieve this, the EC began authenticating EPIC data by linking it with the Aadhaar database. It had linked more than 300 million voters in a span of three months. However, the Supreme Court in an interim order, in August 2015, held that the mandatory use of Aadhaar should only be for welfare schemes and PAN linking. Following this order, the NERPAP exercise was discontinued.

After the Supreme Court’s final order in Puttaswamy in September 2018, that upheld the constitutional validity of the Aadhaar Act, the EC sought amendments to the Representation of the People Act, 1950 (RP Act, 1950). The Parliament amended the RP Act, 1950 and The Registration of Electors Rules, 1960 in December 2021 to enable the linking of EPIC with Aadhaar. It provided the format in which Aadhaar information may be submitted to the electoral registration officer by a new voter at the time of fresh registration (Form 6: to establish identity) or an existing voter already included in the electoral roll (Form 6B: for the purpose of authentication). Any other listed document may be submitted only if the voter is unable to furnish their Aadhaar number because they do not have one. However, in order to keep these amendments voluntary in nature, the word ‘may’ have been used in the amendments. Further, the amendment also specifies that no application for inclusion of name in the electoral roll shall be denied and no entries shall be deleted due to the inability of an individual to furnish or intimate the Aadhaar number due to ‘sufficient cause.’

Such individuals may furnish alternate documents like PAN card, Driving Licence, Passport, Bank passbook etc.

While the above amendments were challenged in the Supreme Court, the EC in September 2023 informed the court that submission of the Aadhaar number is not mandatory. It added that it is looking into issuing appropriate clarificatory changes in the forms introduced for this purpose. However, it may be noted that Form 6 and 6B have not been amended till date and they continue to seek the same details as before from the applicants.

The forms require the voters to declare that they do not have an Aadhar number to avoid providing the same.

### What are the pros and cons?

EPIC linkage with the respective Aadhaar number would definitely help in weeding out duplicate entries; that is essential. At present, more than 650 million Aadhaar numbers have already been uploaded in the process of finalising the electoral rolls. However, there are some concerns about this exercise that need to be considered.

Firstly, the errors in the Aadhaar database, however miniscule, may result in wrongful rejection or deletion of entries from the electoral roll. Secondly, Aadhaar is only a proof of residence and not a proof of citizenship. Thus, it may not help in removing voters who are not citizens from the electoral roll. It would require a separate effort from the EC.

Finally, while the linkage is to happen at the back end and a mere mention of the Aadhaar number on the EPIC/electoral roll may not by itself be a violation of right to privacy, it may still result in misuse as the electoral rolls are widely circulated amongst political parties.

### What can be the way forward?

The right to vote is a constitutional right and declared so by the Supreme Court in various cases. It is part of the basic structure of free and fair elections and cannot be constricted through legislative action. Citizens are the most important stakeholders in a democracy and any electoral process should gain their confidence. There must be wide publicity about the benefits of linking EPIC and Aadhaar to clean up the electoral roll of duplicate entries, which in turn strengthens the electoral process. Any misplaced concern amongst voters about the secrecy of their vote being compromised because of this linking should be assuaged.

Meanwhile, the forms should be suitably modified without any delay, to reflect that providing Aadhaar is not mandatory, as per the submission of the EC in the Supreme Court in September 2023.

> Linking **Voter IDs** with **Aadhaar** aims to prevent **electoral fraud**, eliminate **duplicate** and **fake voter entries**, and enhance the integrity of elections. It can streamline voter verification and improve the accuracy of electoral rolls. However, concerns over **privacy**, **data security**, and potential **voter disenfranchisement** arise due to the risk of data misuse and exclusion of marginalized groups lacking Aadhaar access. Critics argue it could enable **surveillance** and violate individual rights. A balanced approach with strong **data protection laws** and safeguards is essential to ensure transparency, security, and inclusivity in the electoral process.
