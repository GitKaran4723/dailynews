# OYO’s new policy may be at the cost of rights

Payal Kapadia’s award-winning film **All We Imagine As Light** depicts the journey of a young couple, Anu and Shiaz, struggling to find a private space. They may be fictional, but their problem certainly is not. Across the country, young people in pre-marital relationships have long found it difficult to come by privacy. This issue is likely to be exacerbated by policies such as the one recently implemented by OYO.

Last week, OYO announced that unmarried couples would be disallowed from accessing its partner hotels. The hotels have been given the discretion to implement this policy in accordance with local sensibilities. Going forward, all couples will be required to present **‘valid proof of relationship’** while checking in. Explaining the reason for its move, OYO stated that civil society groups and citizens had requested it to institute this rule.

Initially, the policy will apply only to hotels in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, but reports suggest that OYO may expand its application to other cities. Beyond the practicalities of providing ‘valid proof of relationship,’ it is clear that OYO is encouraging partner hotels to discriminate against customers based on their marital status. The burning question, however, is whether those adversely affected by this policy may find legal redress either in the Constitution or otherwise.

In various decisions, the Supreme Court has recognised individuals’ right to enter pre-marital relationships. In **Shafin Jahan vs Asokan K.M. (2020)**, the court held that **Article 21** of the Constitution includes the right of individuals to choose their partners **‘whether within or outside marriage’**. Similarly, in **Navtej Singh Johar vs Union of India (2018)**, the court recognised the right of all individuals to physical, emotional, mental, and sexual companionship. Other decisions of the apex court have affirmed that the rights to privacy, dignity, and autonomy — emanating from Article 21 — mean that people have the freedom to engage in consensual, intimate, or sexual relationships and to cohabit with their partners if they choose. At their core, these decisions acknowledge the freedom to conduct oneself in a manner of one’s choosing. For many unmarried couples, accessing hotel services is one way to exercise these rights. Individuals in pre-marital relationships apart, persons of different genders who are friends, colleagues, or cousins may also travel together and require OYO’s services.

Under the constitutional scheme, fundamental rights enshrined in **Part III** of the Constitution are ordinarily enforceable against the State and its instrumentalities, not against non-State actors. In other words, citizens may seek constitutional remedies from courts when the State infringes upon their fundamental rights but not when a private party hinders their exercise. This is because constitutional rights are generally thought to apply “vertically” (i.e., against the State) and not “horizontally” (i.e., between private individuals or entities).

However, the Constitution contains three express provisions which depart from the traditional “vertical” model of rights: **Article 15(2)** stipulates that no citizen shall, on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth, or any of them, be prevented from accessing shops, public restaurants, hotels and places of public entertainment or using wells, tanks, bathing ghats, roads, and places of public resort funded by the State or dedicated to public use; **Article 17** forbids the practice of untouchability; and **Article 23** prohibits human trafficking and forced labour. In **Kaushal Kishor vs State of Uttar Pradesh (2023)**, the Supreme Court travelled beyond this schema of horizontal rights by holding that the right under **Article 21** could be enforced even against private parties.

While **Article 15(2)** would prevent OYO from denying its services to customers based on caste, religion, or the other grounds listed, it may not readily constitute a bar against discrimination on the ground of **marital status**. Separately, the effect of the decision in the Kaushal Kishor case remains to be seen — commentators have criticised it for being unclear, and in the absence of coherent and consistent jurisprudence on this subject, it is uncertain whether unmarried individuals can enforce their rights under Article 21 against OYO.

Apart from constitutional rights and remedies, statutes may provide a model for the exercise of fundamental rights in transactions between private parties. While some enactments confer certain rights on women irrespective of marital status, the time may have come for lawmakers to enact an anti-discrimination law which protects individuals (regardless of their gender) against discrimination based on marital status, in the private sphere.

The full and free exercise of our rights as citizens depends not only on State (in) action but on private actors — be it as a member of the public, a family unit, a business undertaking, or a corporation — creating the conditions for their exercise. This applies not only in the context of individuals in pre-marital relationships who may seek commercial services but also more broadly, say, to people who may wish to rent homes, who apply for employment in private establishments, or who make offers to purchase land – but are denied access on the basis of their marital status, caste, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, or other attributes.

The tyranny of the majority is often nowhere as evident as in the private sphere. An act may not meet with social approval but the Constitution guarantees our right to do it anyway. The law — regardless of the form it takes — must protect this right.

> OYO's new policy has sparked concerns over potential violations of **customer rights** and **privacy**. Reports suggest that the policy may involve increased data collection, stricter booking regulations, or restrictions affecting customer freedom. Critics argue that such measures could lead to misuse of personal data, reduced transparency, and discriminatory practices. Additionally, it may undermine **consumer protection laws** and **data privacy norms**, raising ethical and legal questions. To balance security and customer rights, OYO must ensure **transparent policies**, **data security**, and **non-discriminatory practices** that prioritize customer trust and legal compliance.

# The red flag as China’s expansionist strategy rolls on

In recent days, India has witnessed two significant incidents of Chinese aggression along the China-India border, highlighting vulnerabilities that not only threaten India’s territorial integrity but also undermine its sovereignty. The Chinese government’s announcement of the construction of a dam on the Yarlung Zangbo river (which is the Brahmaputra river), and the creation of two new counties in north-eastern Ladakh, have set alarm bells ringing.

India has strongly condemned these Chinese actions, asserting that they are illegal and a direct challenge to India’s sovereignty. In response to China’s ambitious hydropower project, India has expressed concern, noting that it is monitoring the situation and will take necessary measures to safeguard its national interests. These developments are particularly disturbing given the recent consensus on troop disengagement along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). These new moves further underscore the unpredictability of China’s approach in the region.

### The transboundary water issue

India is not alone in facing the brunt of China’s expansionist policies. Other South Asian countries such as Nepal and Bhutan have been subjected in a similar manner to Chinese territorial encroachments. Disputes over land boundaries persist between China and several of its South Asian neighbours, and China’s unilateral actions with respect to transboundary rivers, particularly the Brahmaputra and Indus river systems, have the potential to jeopardise water security in India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Pakistan. Despite these challenges, each country has opted to engage with China on a bilateral basis.

The proposed Chinese dam, with an annual capacity to generate 300 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity a year, is located on the lower reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo near the China-India border. This massive infrastructure project presents significant challenges for downstream countries, particularly India and Bangladesh.

The construction of the dam is likely to reduce the amount of water and silt reaching downstream, which could have severe long-term consequences for agriculture, fisheries, and biodiversity in India and Bangladesh. Further, during the monsoon season or in times of geopolitical tensions, the uncontrolled release of water could result in devastating floods along the Indian border, which will be an issue of strategic vulnerability for India. In anticipation, India has accelerated plans to build its own hydropower projects and reservoirs, including an investment of $1 billion to expedite the construction of 12 hydropower stations in Arunachal Pradesh.

### Border disputes, cartographic aggression

China’s recent actions, including the creation of the two new counties, are a part of its ongoing strategy of cartographic aggression aimed at asserting control over disputed territories. This kind of tactic is intended to gain strategic leverage over its regional adversaries.

China’s territorial disputes with India are multifaceted, with the most recent aggression occurring along the western front, specifically in Ladakh. Additionally, China continues to lay claim to Arunachal Pradesh, a State that is an inalienable part of India. Beyond India, China also asserts overlapping claims on territories in countries such as Nepal and Bhutan.

China’s tactics in asserting territorial claims— such as renaming locations within Indian-controlled territories, establishing settlements in disputed areas, and incorporating contested regions into official maps — are becoming increasingly visible. For instance, in 2023, the Chinese government standardised 11 locations in Arunachal Pradesh to assert its ownership, following similar actions in 2021 and 2017.

However, international law does not recognise territorial claims based solely on cartographic assertions. In various landmark cases, which include the ruling by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on the Minquiers and Ecrehos dispute between the United Kingdom and France, maps were deemed insufficient evidence of sovereignty. The ICJ ruled that effective administrative control and sovereignty are crucial for determining ownership of contested territories. Therefore, China’s use of cartographic aggression, while provocative, lacks legal validity under international law. Nevertheless, China’s efforts to establish a physical presence in disputed territories, such as by building settlements, could complicate matters for India in the future.

### The South Asian response

While China has sought economic engagement with all South Asian nations, its territorial and water-related disputes with these countries continue to strain regional relations. Unlike the Southeast Asian nations, which have employed collective responsive measures through multilateral organisations such as the Mekong River Commission (MRC) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), South Asian countries, including India, have chosen to address their concerns with China on a bilateral basis. This approach has largely been shaped by the power asymmetry between China and its smaller neighbours.

India, as the dominant regional power in South Asia, should take the lead in fostering a collective response to China’s actions. A unified approach, including regional forums, multilateral institutions, or enhanced diplomatic coordination would strengthen South Asia’s position in addressing China’s increasing influence and territorial ambitions. A comprehensive strategy involving diplomatic engagement and regional cooperation is crucial for India’s sovereignty and regional security in the face of China’s growing assertiveness.

> China's **expansionist strategy** continues to raise global concerns, marked by aggressive territorial claims in the **South China Sea**, border tensions with India, and increasing influence in the **Indo-Pacific** through infrastructure projects like the **Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)**. Its assertive military posturing, economic coercion, and diplomatic pressures signal ambitions to reshape regional and global power dynamics. This expansionism threatens **sovereignty**, disrupts **global trade routes**, and heightens **geopolitical tensions**. Nations are responding by strengthening alliances, enhancing military preparedness, and advocating for a **rules-based international order** to counterbalance China’s growing strategic influence.
