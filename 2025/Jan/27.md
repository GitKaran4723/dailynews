# Why 'Socialism' word excluded in 1947 but added in preamble in 1976 

The term **"socialist"** was not included in the Preamble of the Indian Constitution in 1947 because the framers of the Constitution, including Nehru and Ambedkar, chose not to explicitly align India with any particular ideological framework. They aimed to build a flexible Constitution that could evolve over time, accommodating diverse political and economic ideologies suitable for India's dynamic socio-economic conditions.

### **Reasons for Exclusion in 1947:**

1. **Focus on Economic Flexibility**:
   - At the time of independence, India needed economic policies that could adapt to the challenges of poverty, inequality, and underdevelopment. A rigid commitment to socialism was seen as limiting economic experimentation.

2. **Non-Alignment with a Specific Ideology**:
   - India aimed to remain non-aligned in its ideological stance, drawing from various models rather than strictly adhering to socialism, capitalism, or any single doctrine.

3. **Practical Governance Challenges**:
   - The immediate post-independence priority was nation-building, addressing communal tensions, economic recovery, and ensuring democratic stability rather than committing to a specific socio-economic structure.

4. **Diverse Political Perspectives**:
   - The framers respected the diversity of political ideologies within India, ranging from socialism to free-market capitalism, and avoided explicitly favoring one.

---

### **Why Was It Added in 1976?**

The term "socialist" was introduced in the **42nd Amendment** during the Emergency under **Prime Minister Indira Gandhi** to emphasize the state's commitment to reducing inequality and addressing socio-economic disparities.

1. **Indira Gandhi's Political Strategy**:
   - During the Emergency (1975–77), Indira Gandhi sought to strengthen her political position by appealing to the masses with populist policies and aligning with socialist rhetoric.

2. **Economic and Social Context**:
   - The 1970s were marked by widespread poverty, unemployment, and inequality. The government’s shift toward socialism aimed to underscore its focus on redistributive justice and welfare policies.

3. **Global Trends**:
   - Many developing countries in the post-colonial era leaned towards socialist policies to address socio-economic inequities, influenced by the success of the Soviet model.

4. **Legal and Political Clarity**:
   - Including "socialist" in the Preamble formally articulated the state's responsibility to strive for economic and social justice.

---

### **Conclusion**

The omission of "socialist" in 1947 reflected the framers' pragmatic approach to allow policy flexibility. Its inclusion in 1976 signaled a formal commitment to reducing inequality and adopting welfare-oriented governance. However, India's understanding of socialism remains uniquely its own, blending state intervention with market mechanisms to achieve socio-economic justice.

> The term **"socialist"** was excluded from the Constitution in 1947 to maintain ideological flexibility and adapt to India's diverse socio-economic needs post-independence. The framers avoided committing to a single ideology, focusing instead on practical nation-building and democratic stability. It was added in **1976** through the **42nd Amendment** during Indira Gandhi’s Emergency to emphasize the government’s commitment to reducing inequality and promoting socio-economic justice. This move aligned with the global trend of adopting socialist policies in developing nations and reinforced India’s welfare-oriented governance approach. India's socialism balances state intervention and market mechanisms to address poverty and inequality while ensuring justice.

# Should Governors head State universities?

The role of the Governor as Chancellor of State universities is a subject of intense debate. It is often misconstrued as a post-Independence measure to safeguard universities against political interference. This role has not been assigned to the Governor by the Constitution of India but by State university laws. Inherited from British colonial rule, it was designed to restrict university autonomy rather than promote it.

In 1857, the British established the first three universities in Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras, appointing Governors of the respective presidencies as their ex-officio Chancellors to maintain direct control. As Chancellor, the Governor became the head of the university and was granted powers such as appointing Vice-Chancellors, nominating members to university bodies like the Syndicate, approving delegated legislation under the university law, and presiding over convocations. Unfortunately, this model of “Governor as Chancellor” was adopted wholesale for State universities even after Independence, without reassessing its relevance in a democratic and federal context.

### A politicised office

Initially, from 1947 to 1967, the dominance of the Congress party at both the Centre and State levels ensured that Governors remained ceremonial figures, with Chief Ministers wielding real power. Consequently, there was little impetus to amend the colonial-era provision of “Governor as Chancellor.”

However, the political landscape changed after 1967 when several States were ruled by parties other than the ruling party or coalition at the Centre. Governors increasingly transformed from neutral constitutional functionaries to political instruments of the Central government. This change saw them asserting control over university affairs, which often resulted in clashes with State governments. Efforts to amend university laws for change of Chancellor faced roadblocks, as Governors either delayed approving such amendments or referred them to the President. Only a few States succeeded in getting the amendments passed.

Even the Centre’s First Administrative Reforms Commission (1966–77) criticised the politicisation of the Governor’s office, highlighting the appointment of defeated politicians, which eroded the office’s dignity. The Sarkaria Commission (1983-88) on Centre-State Relations, revealed that over 60% of Governors had been active politicians, many of them immediately before their appointment, with quality declining steeply after the Nehru era. Professor Ashok Pankaj’s study (1950-2015) found that 52% of Governors were politicians, 26% were retired bureaucrats, and only 22% hailed from academia, the judiciary, or the armed forces. It highlighted a growing trend of appointing Governors based on political loyalty, undermining the office’s credibility and exacerbating its misuse.

### Governor’s dual role

Constitutionally, a Governor’s powers are divided into two categories: those exercised as Governor, where he is bound to act on the advice of the Council of Ministers as per Article 163(1), and those conferred by statutes, such as the role of Chancellor of State universities, where he can act at his discretion, independent of ministerial advice, unless the statute mandates otherwise. The Supreme Court has upheld this distinction. This has enabled Governors to bypass ministerial advice in critical university matters like appointing Vice-Chancellors, nominating members to university bodies, and approving subordinate legislation, particularly in Opposition-ruled States.

### Governor and the President

Despite similar legal frameworks, a stark contrast exists between the Governor’s role as Chancellor of State universities and the President’s role as Visitor of Central universities. The key difference is the level of consultation and legislative oversight.

The President maintains a cordial relationship with the Centre. He functions through the Ministry of Education and consults with it for appointments of Vice-Chancellors, nomination of members to university bodies, and approval of ‘statutes’ (a type of delegated legislation under the university law). Central university laws require the statutes, along with other types of delegated legislation called ‘ordinances’ and ‘regulations’, to be laid before the Parliament.

In contrast, the Governor acts unilaterally while performing similar functions for State universities, often bypassing the State’s Ministry of Higher Education entirely, particularly in Opposition-ruled States. State University laws do not mandate laying delegated legislation — statutes, ordinances, and regulations — before the Legislature. This is a significant flaw rooted in the continuation of colonial-era practices.

### Existing challenges

The persistence of the “Governor as Chancellor” model has caused numerous problems in the governance of State universities.

While State governments fund these universities, Governors wield substantial power without corresponding accountability. This creates a dual authority system, forcing university leadership to serve two masters, often with conflicting demands.

Disagreements between Governors and State governments, particularly in Opposition-ruled States, lead to delays in appointing Vice-Chancellors, causing administrative paralysis. These delays affect areas such as the appointment of staff, the implementation of projects, and even the awarding of degrees.

Many Governors lack the academic qualifications or experience necessary to effectively guide educational institutions. They tend to rely on limited, non-transparent advice, leading to questionable decisions.

Rather than insulating universities from politics, some Governors exacerbate political interference, often prioritising the Centre’s political agenda over the universities’ autonomy and interests.

Allowing Governors — appointed by the Centre — to control State institutions compromises the principle of federalism. State universities should be fully accountable to elected State governments.

### Insights from Commissions

Various commissions have examined the Governor’s role as Chancellor and proposed reforms. The Rajamannar Committee (1969-71) on Centre-State relations, appointed by the Government of Tamil Nadu, argued that the Governor’s statutory functions are included within the meaning of ‘functions’ under Article 163(1). So, the Governor should perform his statutory functions as Chancellor also on the advice of the State government. However, the Supreme Court has not upheld this interpretation.

The Sarkaria Commission (1983-88) on Centre-State relations, recognised that the Governor’s role as Chancellor is statutory, not constitutional, and must be defined by State laws. It recommended that Governors consult with Chief Ministers while retaining independent judgment in university matters.

The National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution (2000-02), headed by Justice M.N. Venkatachaliah, advocated for political neutrality, a clearer definition of the Chancellor’s functions, a supportive rather than authoritative role, and greater university autonomy.

The M.M.Punchhi Commission (2007-10) on Centre-State relations recommended that the Governor focus on constitutional responsibilities, avoiding statutory roles like that of Chancellor to preserve the dignity of the office. It suggested that States appoint eminent academics or experts as Chancellors to ensure academic independence and prevent conflicts.

### Alternative models

The ideal Chancellor model, based on global best practices, envisions the Chancellor as an eminent public figure who provides ceremonial leadership, presides over convocations, acts as an institutional ambassador, and has no executive authority. Universities in the U.K., from whom we borrowed the concept of Chancellor, exemplify this model. There are several ways to amend State university laws to implement this reform: The Governor as Ceremonial Chancellor model removes the Governor’s discretionary powers, mandating him to act on the advice of the State Council of Ministers in university matters. Gujarat (1978), Karnataka (2000), and Maharashtra (2021) have adopted variations of this approach.

In the Chief Minister as Chancellor model, critics argue that a ceremonial role does not suit a powerful political figure like the Chief Minister. West Bengal and Punjab passed Bills in 2023 to adopt this system, but they await Presidential assent. In a variation, Tamil Nadu passed a Bill in 2022 substituting ‘Government’ for ‘Chancellor’. It also awaits Presidential assent.

The State-appointed Chancellor model, implemented in Telangana in 2015, has the State government appoint a ceremonial Chancellor. A similar Bill was passed by Kerala in 2022, but it is still awaiting Presidential assent. The Kerala Bill specifies that the appointee should be an eminent academician or public figure.

The Chancellor elected by the University Bodies model empowers university bodies and alumni to elect a ceremonial Chancellor as in Oxford, Cambridge and Edinburgh universities.

In the Chancellor appointed by the University’s Executive Council model, several universities in the U.K. (Birmingham), Canada (McGill) and Australia (Melbourne) appoint ceremonial Chancellors through their Executive Council or Board of Governors, following transparent selection processes.

Among these, the State-appointed Chancellor model is the most practical for India, provided the appointees are distinguished academicians or public figures, excluding politicians. The M.M.Punchhi Commission had recommended it.

### Dismantling a colonial legacy

Reforming State universities in India demands a careful balance of key principles: ensuring accountability to elected State governments, minimising political interference, promoting institutional self-governance, and fostering academic freedom and excellence. The vital first step is divesting the Governor of his colonial-era role as Chancellor.

While States like Gujarat, Karnataka, Telangana, and Maharashtra have implemented reforms, others such as Tamil Nadu, Kerala, West Bengal, and Punjab face indefinite delays in obtaining Presidential assent for their proposed changes. This disparity underscores the need for impartial treatment by the President and Government of India. There is no valid reason for withholding approval of the pending Bills and resolving such matters through the Supreme Court under Article 131 should be avoided. The Centre should facilitate progressive reforms that seek to dismantle colonial-era administrative structures, guide States towards aligning their university governance models with global best practices, and enable universities to focus on academic excellence free from political entanglements.

> The role of Governors as heads of State universities has sparked debate. Supporters argue that Governors ensure impartiality, uphold constitutional mandates, and maintain checks and balances in university administration. This prevents political interference and ensures adherence to national academic standards. However, critics contend that involving Governors in university affairs politicizes the role, compromises autonomy, and may lead to conflicts between the State and the Governor. Education being a concurrent subject demands decentralized governance. A balanced approach could involve limiting Governors' roles to ceremonial functions, empowering academicians in decision-making, and ensuring accountability to protect the independence of higher education institutions.

---

### **Demerits of the Delhi Model**

While the Delhi Model has received praise for its citizen-centric approach, several challenges and criticisms persist:

1. **Overemphasis on Populism**:
   - The model is criticized for being heavily focused on **freebies and subsidies**, which may strain public finances and reduce funds for long-term developmental projects.

2. **Sustainability Concerns**:
   - Subsidized utilities and free services might not be sustainable in the long run, especially with growing population demands and rising costs.

3. **Healthcare Limitations**:
   - While Mohalla Clinics have been celebrated, there are concerns about their limited reach, inconsistent services, and inadequate secondary and tertiary healthcare facilities.

4. **Education Challenges**:
   - Despite improvements in infrastructure, critics argue that learning outcomes in government schools have not seen proportional improvements.

5. **Focus on Urban Areas**:
   - The Delhi Model primarily focuses on urban development, neglecting the peri-urban and rural areas of Delhi where services remain inconsistent.

6. **Political Centralization**:
   - The model often clashes with Delhi’s unique governance structure, with limited authority over law enforcement and municipal governance, leading to conflicts between the state and central government.

7. **Lack of Industrial and Employment Focus**:
   - While public services have improved, critics argue that the model lacks robust strategies for industrial growth, employment generation, and economic development.

8. **Environmental Concerns**:
   - While pollution control initiatives are in place, the long-term impact of measures like the odd-even scheme remains debatable, as they address symptoms rather than root causes.

9. **Dependency Culture**:
   - The heavy reliance on free services may create a culture of dependency, potentially discouraging self-reliance and private-sector growth.
and almost fiscal prudence of Delhi government not by revenue increase but social sector spending increases diverting fund from capital expenditure.

---

### **Conclusion**

The Delhi Model has demonstrated success in providing citizen-centric governance, especially in education, healthcare, and public utilities. However, its sustainability, overemphasis on subsidies, and limited focus on broader economic development raise concerns. For the model to be replicable, it must address long-term challenges like fiscal sustainability, industrial growth, and balanced development across all sectors.

# Controversy around SS Rajamouli Tweet

### **Understanding Regionalism**

**Regionalism** refers to the loyalty or attachment of people to their specific region, often arising due to shared language, culture, history, or economic interests. While it can foster pride and identity, excessive regionalism can overshadow national unity and lead to divisions.

#### **Positive Aspects of Regionalism**:
1. **Cultural Preservation**: It helps protect regional languages, traditions, and heritage.
2. **Decentralization**: Encourages local governance and regional development.
3. **Empowerment**: Addresses specific needs and aspirations of different regions.

#### **Negative Aspects of Regionalism**:
1. **Divisive Tendencies**: Overemphasis on regional identity can lead to separatism or conflicts, challenging national integration.
2. **Discrimination**: Regional bias can marginalize people from other parts of the country.
3. **Politicization**: Politicians may exploit regional sentiments for electoral gains, further deepening divides.

---

### **"I am Indian; Can I Still Be Gujarati, Kannadiga, Bihari, or Tamilian?"**

This statement reflects the dual identity of individuals in a diverse nation like India. It is not wrong to take pride in one’s regional identity while embracing a larger Indian identity. India's strength lies in its **"Unity in Diversity"**.

However, the concern arises when regional identity:
- Overshadows national identity.
- Is used to exclude or discriminate against others.
- Leads to extreme regionalism that harms national cohesion.

One can celebrate regional achievements (e.g., the Padma Awards for Telugu personalities) while recognizing that these achievements contribute to the larger national pride. Being Telugu, Gujarati, or Tamilian complements, not contradicts, being Indian.

---

### **Gandhiji’s View on Regionalism and Nationalism**

Mahatma Gandhi believed in the harmonious coexistence of regional and national identities. He saw India as a nation of diverse cultures, languages, and traditions, which should be celebrated rather than suppressed. Some key points from his philosophy:

1. **Diversity as Strength**:
   - Gandhi emphasized that India's diversity enriched the nation and was not a weakness. He believed every region had unique contributions to make to the collective identity of India.

2. **Inclusive Nationalism**:
   - For Gandhi, nationalism was about unity and inclusiveness. He stressed that regional identity should never conflict with national unity.

3. **Cultural Preservation**:
   - Gandhi supported preserving regional languages and traditions while promoting inter-regional understanding and mutual respect.

4. **Constructive Patriotism**:
   - He believed that regional pride should contribute to national pride, not create divisions. For instance, celebrating a Gujarati or Telugu identity is part of celebrating India.

---

### **Conclusion**

It is not wrong to identify as Gujarati, Kannadiga, Bihari, or Tamilian, as long as such identities coexist with a strong sense of being Indian. Regional pride becomes problematic only when it leads to exclusivity or undermines national unity. As Gandhiji taught, India's diversity should foster unity, where each region’s uniqueness enriches the collective identity of the nation. Embracing this perspective ensures we remain proud Indians while cherishing our regional roots.

# No additional funds for MGNREGS; wages delayed

### **What is MGNREGS?**

The **Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS)**, enacted under the **Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), 2005**, is a flagship social welfare program by the Government of India. Its key features include:

1. **Right to Work**: Guarantees at least **100 days of wage employment** annually to every rural household willing to do unskilled manual labor.
2. **Employment on Demand**: Workers must be provided employment within 15 days of demand; failing which, they are entitled to unemployment allowances.
3. **Focus on Rural Development**: Employment activities focus on creating durable assets, such as water conservation, land development, and rural infrastructure.
4. **Gender Inclusivity**: A minimum of one-third of the beneficiaries are women.
5. **Direct Benefit Transfers (DBT)**: Wages are credited directly to workers' bank accounts.

---

### **Impact of Wage Delays under MGNREGS**

#### **1. Financial Distress for Workers**:
   - MGNREGS caters primarily to rural poor, who depend on timely wages for basic necessities like food, healthcare, and education.
   - Wage delays push families into debt cycles, forcing them to borrow from informal sources at high-interest rates.

#### **2. Undermining Trust in the Scheme**:
   - Delays erode the confidence of workers in the scheme, leading to a decline in participation and weakening the program's effectiveness.

#### **3. Migration to Urban Areas**:
   - Rural households might migrate to urban areas in search of alternative employment, exacerbating urban overcrowding and informal labor issues.

#### **4. Socio-Economic Inequality**:
   - Delays disproportionately affect marginalized groups, including women and SC/ST communities, worsening existing inequalities.

#### **5. Negative Impact on Rural Development**:
   - With fewer workers participating, fewer assets are created, hindering rural infrastructure and long-term development goals.

#### **6. Inflationary Pressures**:
   - Wage delays lead to reduced purchasing power in rural areas, affecting demand for goods and services, thereby contributing to deflationary trends in the rural economy.

---

### **Way Forward**

1. **Timely Allocation of Funds**: Ensure adequate budget allocation for MGNREGS to meet wage demands without delays.
2. **Streamlined Payment Systems**: Improve DBT infrastructure for faster and error-free wage disbursement.
3. **Accountability Mechanisms**: Impose penalties on officials for delays and conduct regular audits to ensure efficiency.
4. **Policy Reforms**: Introduce dynamic budget provisions to accommodate seasonal or emergency surges in demand for MGNREGS work. 
5. **Community Awareness**: Empower rural households to demand accountability under MGNREGA provisions like unemployment allowances.

> The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) provides 100 days of wage employment annually to rural households for unskilled manual labor, aiming to reduce poverty and create rural assets. Wage delays under MGNREGS severely impact rural workers, leading to financial distress, increased debt, erosion of trust in the scheme, and migration to urban areas. It disproportionately affects marginalized groups, hampers rural development, and reduces purchasing power, impacting the rural economy. To address these challenges, timely fund allocation, streamlined payment systems, enhanced accountability, and policy reforms are essential to ensure the program’s effectiveness and support for vulnerable rural populations.

# Extremists call to boycott celebrations fails; ULFA claims ‘blast’ in Guwahati

### Impact on India's Internal Security

The reported incident of extremists calling for a boycott of celebrations and ULFA claiming responsibility for a blast in Guwahati has several implications for India's internal security:

#### 1. **Rise of Insurgency Threats**:
   - Such incidents signify the presence of insurgent groups like ULFA (United Liberation Front of Asom), which aim to disrupt peace and challenge the sovereignty of the Indian state, especially in Northeast India.
   - It showcases the vulnerability of public spaces and critical infrastructures to terror attacks.

#### 2. **Public Safety and Fear**:
   - Incidents like these create fear and panic among the general population, affecting public confidence in the government’s ability to ensure security.

#### 3. **Economic Disruptions**:
   - Such events deter investments, tourism, and economic activities in the affected regions, causing long-term economic setbacks.

#### 4. **Challenges in Countering Extremism**:
   - Northeast India, with its difficult terrain and porous borders with countries like Myanmar and Bangladesh, poses challenges in monitoring and countering cross-border terrorism and insurgency.

#### 5. **Undermining National Celebrations**:
   - Boycotting national events and creating disturbances reflects the intent to harm the nation’s unity and communal harmony.

---

### Government Measures to Tackle Such Threats

#### 1. **Counter-Insurgency Operations**:
   - Security forces such as the Assam Police and paramilitary units (CRPF, Assam Rifles) conduct regular counter-insurgency operations to neutralize militant activities.
   - Strengthening the intelligence network to preempt attacks.

#### 2. **Border Management**:
   - Enhanced security at international borders to prevent arms smuggling and infiltration of militants.
   - Collaboration with neighboring countries, especially Myanmar and Bangladesh, to dismantle insurgent hideouts.

#### 3. **Development Initiatives**:
   - Government initiatives like the Act East Policy focus on the socio-economic development of the Northeast to reduce the appeal of insurgency.
   - Implementation of skill development and employment generation programs for the youth.

#### 4. **Political Dialogue**:

---

### Way Forward

1. **Enhanced Intelligence Sharing**:
   - Strengthen coordination between central and state agencies to gather actionable intelligence and preempt attacks.
   - Use technology like AI, drones, and surveillance systems to monitor sensitive areas.

2. **Socio-Economic Development**:
   - Addressing grievances like unemployment, underdevelopment, and ethnic identity concerns to reduce the root causes of insurgency.
   - Focus on inclusive development and better integration of the Northeast with the rest of India.

3. **Community Engagement**:
   - Build trust with local communities through outreach programs and community policing.
   - Encourage civil society and grassroots organizations to play an active role in promoting peace.

4. **International Cooperation**:
   - Strengthen ties with Myanmar and Bangladesh to ensure coordinated action against cross-border insurgency.
   - Leverage international platforms to isolate groups supporting militancy.

5. **Strengthen Anti-Terror Mechanisms**:
   - Modernize the police force and enhance training in counter-terrorism.
   - Implement robust crisis management plans to ensure quick responses to incidents.

6. **Monitoring Propaganda**:
   - Track and counter the spread of extremist ideologies online and offline through effective counter-propaganda measures.

By addressing these aspects, the government can ensure long-term stability, peace, and development in the region while safeguarding India's internal security.

> The ULFA’s claim of a blast in Guwahati and a call to boycott celebrations highlight ongoing internal security challenges in Northeast India. Such incidents undermine public safety, disrupt economic activities, and showcase the persistence of insurgent threats in the region. The government has responded through counter-insurgency operations, enhanced border management, socio-economic initiatives, and political dialogue. To strengthen security further, measures like improved intelligence-sharing, inclusive development, community engagement, international cooperation, and modernized anti-terror mechanisms are essential. A focus on addressing root causes such as unemployment and identity issues, alongside robust crisis management, will help ensure long-term peace and stability.
