# China’s moves must recast India’s critical minerals push

### China's Strategic Use of Export Controls on Critical Minerals

On January 2, 2025, China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) expanded its export control list to include 28 U.S. entities, restricting their access to various items under dual-use export controls. Central to these restrictions are critical minerals and refined materials vital for high-tech applications like aerospace, semiconductors, batteries, and advanced electronics. The restricted minerals include tungsten, gallium, magnesium, beryllium, hafnium, lithium-6 (isotope), and others used in chip production, specialty alloys, and high-tech manufacturing.

This move is part of China’s long-standing strategy of leveraging its dominance in critical minerals as a geopolitical tool. Historically, Beijing has carefully weaponized its mineral exports, targeting resources deemed critical by Western nations while considering two key constraints. First, it avoids controlling minerals heavily reliant on Western raw material imports. Second, it refrains from actions that could harm its domestic industries or export-dependent sectors.

The rare earth minerals embargo against Japan in 2010 serves as a significant precedent for this approach. Similarly, recent restrictions on antimony, gallium, and germanium exports, as well as the December 2023 ban on rare earth extraction and processing technologies, underline China’s calculated approach to leveraging its mineral wealth. These actions aim to strengthen China’s strategic and economic position while avoiding unnecessary disruptions to its domestic industries or global partnerships.

China’s export controls reflect its broader economic and geopolitical goals. By restricting access to minerals vital for Western technologies, Beijing seeks to exert pressure on rivals, particularly in the context of ongoing U.S.-China tensions over semiconductor technologies. However, China’s restraint in targeting minerals dependent on external raw material imports or essential to its own industries underscores its pragmatic approach.

This strategy also highlights China’s focus on maintaining its dominance in the global supply chain of critical minerals. For instance, gallium and germanium, essential for semiconductors and high-performance electronics, were specifically targeted to disrupt the Western supply chain without significant impact on China’s industrial base. Similarly, restrictions on lithium-6, crucial for advanced batteries and nuclear technologies, showcase Beijing’s intent to control future technological advancements.

In summary, China’s export restrictions on critical minerals represent a deliberate and calculated geopolitical strategy. By targeting minerals essential to Western industries, Beijing strengthens its leverage in global technological and economic competition while safeguarding its domestic industries and supply chain dominance.

### **Critical Minerals and India’s Approach**

#### **What are Critical Minerals?**
Critical minerals are natural resources that are essential for modern technologies and industries but are scarce or have vulnerable supply chains. These minerals are vital for producing semiconductors, batteries, renewable energy systems, electric vehicles (EVs), aerospace, defense, and advanced electronics. Examples include **lithium, cobalt, nickel, rare earth elements (REEs), tungsten, gallium, hafnium, magnesium, and beryllium**. The strategic importance of these minerals lies in their applications in high-tech manufacturing, clean energy transition, and national security.

#### **Global Dependence on Critical Minerals**
The supply chains for critical minerals are often concentrated in a few countries, making them vulnerable to geopolitical disruptions. For instance:
- China dominates the production and processing of rare earth elements, gallium, and germanium.
- The Democratic Republic of Congo accounts for over 70% of cobalt production.
- Australia and Chile lead lithium extraction, but much of the downstream processing occurs in China.

This monopolization gives supplier nations significant leverage in the global economy and geopolitics, as evident from China’s use of export controls on rare earths and other critical materials to influence global power dynamics.

---

### **India’s Need to Focus on Critical Minerals**
India's rapid industrialization, energy transition goals, and aspirations to become a manufacturing hub require a robust supply of critical minerals. Key areas where critical minerals are essential for India include:
1. **Renewable Energy**: Wind turbines and solar panels require rare earth elements and polysilicon.
2. **Electric Mobility**: Lithium-ion batteries for EVs depend on lithium, cobalt, and nickel.
3. **Defense and Aerospace**: Advanced weaponry, drones, and satellites require tungsten, beryllium, and rare earths.
4. **Semiconductor Manufacturing**: Critical minerals like gallium and germanium are essential for chips and electronic components.

Despite its ambitions, India relies heavily on imports for critical minerals, making it vulnerable to supply disruptions and price volatility. For example:
- India imports the majority of its lithium and cobalt for battery production.
- Dependence on China for rare earths undermines India’s strategic autonomy.

---

### **How Should India Move Forward?**
India needs a strategic and multi-pronged approach to secure its critical minerals. Key steps include:

#### **1. Strengthening Domestic Exploration and Production**

- **Recycling and Urban Mining**: Promoting the recycling of electronic waste (e-waste) and recovering critical minerals can reduce dependence on imports.

#### **2. Building Strategic Reserves**
- Similar to its strategic petroleum reserves, India should establish stockpiles of critical minerals to buffer against supply chain disruptions.

#### **3. Diversifying Import Sources**
- India should reduce its over-reliance on countries like China by securing partnerships with resource-rich nations such as Australia, Chile, and African countries. Initiatives like the **India-Australia Critical Minerals Partnership** are steps in the right direction.

#### **4. Investing in Processing Capabilities**
- India should develop refining and processing infrastructure for critical minerals. Most of the global refining capacity for rare earths and lithium is concentrated in China. Building indigenous processing facilities can reduce this dependence.

#### **5. International Collaboration**
- **Quad Alliance**: Under the Quad (India, USA, Japan, and Australia), India can collaborate on securing critical mineral supply chains and developing alternative sources.
- **Bilateral Agreements**: Partnerships with countries like Australia and Canada can help secure supplies and technology for mining and processing.
- **Participation in Global Initiatives**: India can join organizations like the **Critical Minerals Association** to access global expertise and funding.

#### **6. Focus on R&D and Innovation**
- Investing in research for efficient extraction, refining, and recycling technologies can position India as a leader in sustainable critical mineral use.
- Innovation in substitutes for critical minerals can also reduce dependency. For instance, developing sodium-ion batteries can alleviate the need for lithium.

#### **7. Policy and Institutional Framework**
- A comprehensive **National Critical Minerals Strategy** is essential to address exploration, production, processing, and recycling.
- Dedicated institutions like a **Critical Minerals Board** should oversee policy implementation, resource allocation, and global collaboration.

#### **8. Promoting Sustainable Practices**
- Ensuring that mining and processing adhere to environmental and social standards is crucial to minimize ecological damage and community displacement.

---

### **Conclusion**
Critical minerals are the backbone of modern technology and clean energy transitions, and securing their supply is essential for India’s strategic and economic interests. By focusing on domestic resource development, diversifying imports, strengthening processing capabilities, and leveraging international partnerships, India can reduce its dependence on external suppliers and build a resilient critical mineral ecosystem. A long-term, sustainable strategy will enable India to achieve self-reliance and maintain a competitive edge in the global technological and industrial landscape.
