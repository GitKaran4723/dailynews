# Uttarakhand adopts Uniform Civil Code

The **Uniform Civil Code (UCC)** refers to a single set of personal laws that apply to all citizens of India, irrespective of their religion, gender, caste, or community. It aims to replace the personal laws currently governing various communities, which are based on their religious scriptures and customs. UCC is enshrined as a directive principle of state policy under **Article 44** of the **Indian Constitution**.

### Key Highlights of UCC
1. **Objective**:  
   UCC seeks to provide uniformity in laws related to marriage, divorce, inheritance, adoption, and maintenance, ensuring equality and justice across all citizens.

2. **Article 44**:
   - Part of the **Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP)**.
   - States: *“The State shall endeavor to secure for the citizens a Uniform Civil Code throughout the territory of India.”*
   - It is non-justiciable, meaning it cannot be enforced by courts but serves as a guiding principle for governance.

3. **Why is UCC Significant?**
   - **Equality and Secularism**: Ensures all citizens are treated equally under one set of laws, promoting secularism.
   - **Gender Justice**: Reforms personal laws that are often discriminatory, especially against women.
   - **National Integration**: Aims to bridge divisions created by diverse personal laws.

4. **Current Personal Laws in India**:
   - **Hindu Personal Law**: Governs Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, and Sikhs.
   - **Muslim Personal Law (Sharia)**: Governs Muslims.
   - **Christian and Parsi Personal Laws**: Governs Christians and Parsis.
   - Other communities have customary laws.

5. **Challenges to UCC**:
   - **Diversity in Customs**: India’s cultural and religious diversity makes a single code difficult to implement.
   - **Resistance from Religious Groups**: Concerns over interference in religious freedom (Article 25 – Freedom of Religion).
   - **Political Sensitivity**: The issue is often politicized, leading to resistance from minority communities.

6. **Judicial Support**:
   - **Shah Bano Case (1985)**: The Supreme Court emphasized the need for UCC to ensure equality in matters like maintenance for divorced Muslim women.
   - **Sarla Mudgal Case (1995)**: Reiterated the importance of UCC to avoid conflicts arising from different personal laws.

# ‘Climate is one of many factors that play a part in people’s large-scale movements’

### Migration Concept: An Analysis

Migration refers to the movement of people from one location to another, either temporarily or permanently, driven by a variety of factors. It can be classified into **internal migration** (within a country) and **international migration** (across countries). The phenomenon is influenced by **push factors** (conditions forcing people to leave their place of origin) and **pull factors** (conditions attracting them to a destination).

#### Role of Climate in Migration

Climate change is an increasingly significant factor influencing migration. Environmental events such as droughts, floods, rising sea levels, and desertification disrupt livelihoods, especially in agrarian and coastal regions. For instance:
- **Slow-onset changes** like desertification and rising temperatures push populations to seek better living conditions.
- **Sudden disasters** like hurricanes or tsunamis force large-scale displacements.

The **Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)** highlights that climate-induced migration disproportionately affects vulnerable populations in developing regions, especially in South Asia, Africa, and island nations.

#### Other Factors Influencing Migration

1. **Economic Reasons**:  
   People migrate for better employment opportunities, higher wages, or improved standards of living. Economic migration often leads to urbanization.
   
2. **Social and Political Factors**:  
   Conflicts, persecution, and lack of basic rights often force people to move. Political instability and wars (e.g., the Syrian refugee crisis) are major drivers of forced migration.
   
3. **Demographic Pressures**:  
   Overpopulation, lack of resources, and healthcare push people to relocate.
   
4. **Cultural Aspirations**:  
   Migration for education, marriage, or cultural integration also plays a part.

#### Interplay of Factors

Climate interacts with other factors to influence migration. For example, drought in agrarian economies may lead to economic hardship, forcing migration. Political responses to climate-induced resource scarcity can exacerbate conflicts, leading to forced displacements.

#### Conclusion

Migration is a multi-faceted phenomenon with climate being a crucial, though not exclusive, driver. Addressing climate-induced migration requires global cooperation to mitigate climate change, build resilience, and support affected populations while considering the interplay of social, political, and economic factors.

> Migration involves the movement of people due to various factors, including climate, economic opportunities, political instability, and demographic pressures. Climate change is an emerging driver, with events like droughts, floods, and rising sea levels forcing people to leave their homes. It interacts with other factors, such as economic hardships and resource conflicts, to exacerbate migration. Political instability and wars also contribute significantly to forced displacements. Climate-induced migration disproportionately affects vulnerable populations, particularly in developing nations. Addressing this requires global efforts to mitigate climate impacts, enhance resilience, and provide support to affected populations while considering economic and social dimensions.

# The Union Budget as a turning point for climate action

All eyes will be on Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman when she takes centrestage on February 1 to present the Union Budget. As the nation grapples with increasingly frequent extreme weather events and mounting pressure to meet its climate commitments, the FY26 Budget carries the weight of both urgency and opportunity. With just five years left to achieve India’s first interim Net-Zero target, the Budget must take decisive steps to protect those on the frontlines of climate change.

Previous Budgets have demonstrated the government’s commitment to climate action, notably through initiatives such as the PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijlee Yojana, support for electric vehicle charging infrastructure, viability gap funding for offshore wind energy, and increased allocations for the National Green Hydrogen Mission. Yet, with a total renewable energy installed capacity of 203.18 GW, far short of the 2030 target of 500 GW, accelerated investment and policy support are imperative.

### There is much work to be done

The Budget must prioritise key policy measures to strengthen India’s climate response and accelerate progress on both adaptation and mitigation fronts. First, to accelerate India’s green energy transition, the PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana needs a comprehensive review. While the scheme has seen around 1.45 crore registrations, the completion rate of only 6.34 lakh installations (4.37%) indicates the presence of significant implementation gaps. To address this, the FY26 Budget must take a multi-pronged approach. In the first instance, fiscal allocations should prioritise the Renewable Energy Service Company (RESCO) model, effectively transforming the prohibitive upfront costs into manageable operating expenses for lower-income households through innovative financial instruments and credit guarantees.

In the second instance, the Budget must expand the scope of production-linked incentives (PLI) across the solar module supply chain, addressing the critical supply-demand mismatch, where domestic manufacturing fulfils only 40% of current requirements. This expansion would boost manufacturing capacity and create economies of scale, potentially reducing costs that are 65% higher for domestically manufactured panels than those imported to the country.

In the third instance, India’s vast railway network offers untapped potential for renewable energy generation. Estimates suggest that the Railways’ extensive land banks and track corridors could host up to 5 GW of solar and wind installations. The Budget should encourage innovative public-private partnership models to unlock this opportunity.

### EU mechanism and India

Second, the European Union’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), which will take effect on January 1, 2026, necessitates urgent budgetary interventions to protect India’s export competitiveness. India’s total exports of CBAM products to the EU amount to $8.22 billion annually and will likely face carbon levies ranging from around 20% to 50%.

This presents an existential challenge for India’s Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME), which have a contribution of 30% of GDP and 45% of exports. The Budget can establish a dedicated ‘Climate Action Fund’, modelled after successful initiatives such as Japan’s Green Transformation (GX) Fund for industrial decarbonisation, particularly across the most vulnerable export sectors. The Fund can also support the capacity-building initiatives for MSMEs to ensure proper compliance and reporting under CBAM.

Third, the Budget must accelerate India’s transition to a circular economy. A recent study by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water estimates that the benefit of adopting a circular economy can yield an annual profit of ₹40 lakh crore ($624 billion) for India by 2050 while reducing greenhouse gas emissions by about 44%. A weighted deduction of 150% on investments in recycling infrastructure and refurbishment technologies, complemented by accelerated depreciation benefits for circular economy assets, can encourage businesses to invest in recycling and refurbishment technologies. The Budget should establish a sovereign green bond framework specifically for financing circular economy infrastructure.

### On insurance products, green finance

Fourth, there is a strong need to strengthen climate resilience. India’s insurance penetration remains worryingly low. According to the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) 2023-24 Annual Report, it has declined from 4% in FY23 to 3.7% in FY24. To address this challenge, the Budget could offer tax deductions to insurance companies on income from climate-linked policies and advocate lower Goods and Services Tax (GST) rates on premiums for insurance products specifically designed for climate resilience and disaster protection.

Finally, some estimates indicate that standardising green finance definitions could help build investor confidence and help India get part of the ₹162.5 trillion ($2.5 trillion) needed to achieve the Nationally Determined Contributions by 2030. The Budget should allocate funds to build the institutional and technical infrastructure required to implement the climate finance taxonomy effectively, including for market readiness programmes, verification systems, and capacity building of financial institutions.

The Budget can further catalyse this transition by introducing differential tax treatment for taxonomy-aligned investments and committing to classify government expenditure according to green criteria.

Climate-linked economic policies are no longer peripheral but central to maintaining competitiveness in international trade and investment flows. With rising global demand for low-carbon goods and the increasing alignment of capital markets with sustainability metrics, India must act decisively and integrate climate competitiveness into its fiscal framework. The Budget will indeed signal the seriousness of the government’s intent in this regard.

> The Union Budget can serve as a pivotal moment for advancing climate action by prioritizing green growth, renewable energy, and sustainable development. It can allocate resources for clean energy transitions, climate-resilient infrastructure, and energy efficiency. Initiatives like subsidies for renewable energy, incentives for electric vehicles, and investments in green technologies can reduce emissions and foster sustainability. Additionally, the budget can enhance climate adaptation by funding programs for water conservation, afforestation, and disaster management. By integrating climate action into economic planning, the budget can address environmental challenges while fostering inclusive growth, making it a transformative tool for combating climate change.

# Is the Guillain-Barré Syndrome life-threatening?

Following a reported outbreak of Guillain-Barré Syndrome, a rare neurological disorder, in Pune, with 73 cases so far, the Union Health Ministry has now sent a team to the city to assess the situation. The Maharashtra government has also set up a Rapid Response Team to investigate the sudden rise in infections. A total of 47 men and 26 women have been affected, with 14 on ventilator support, the State Health Department has said, as of Saturday, January 25, 2025.

### What is Guillain-Barré Syndrome?

Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) is an autoimmune neurological disorder in which a person’s immune system attacks their peripheral nerves, leading to muscle weakness that can progress to paralysis. People of any age can be affected, but it is more common in adults and males. The condition is rare, with an estimated incidence of 1/2 per 1,00,000 population.

While the causes of GBS are still not fully understood, in most cases, it occurs after a viral or bacterial infection. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), infection with the bacteria Campylobacter jejuni, which causes gastroenteritis (including symptoms of nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea), is one of the most common risk factors for GBS. People can also develop GBS after having the flu or other viral infections from cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and the Zika virus.

### How does it affect the body?

In autoimmune conditions, the body’s immune system begins to attack its own cells. In GBS, the immune system destroys the myelin sheath — a fatty layer wrapped around nerve cells. This impacts the nerves’ ability to send signals to the brain, which causes weakness in the muscles. GBS affects the peripheral nervous system — the part of the nervous system outside the brain and spinal cord — that controls the movement of muscles, temperature, touch and pain sensations.

The first signs of GBS are usually tingling and weakness that start in the feet and legs before spreading to the upper body, arms and face. Symptoms include a pins and needles feeling in the toes, fingers, ankles or wrists, back pain, pain in the legs, not being able to walk or climb stairs, trouble with facial movements and double vision. For some people this can lead to paralysis of the legs, arms or face. The severity of the symptoms can range from mild to severe. In approximately one-third of people, the chest muscles are affected, making it hard to breathe, the WHO says. The ability to speak and swallow can become affected in severe cases. GBS can lead to life-threatening complications when it affects the autonomic nervous system which controls your blood pressure and heart rate.

### How is it treated?

There is no known cure for GBS. However, there are some treatments that aid in recovery. Most people can make a nearly full recovery. The treatments primarily include plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. In plasma exchange or plasmapheresis, the plasma (liquid part of the blood) is removed, treated and then returned to the body. This removes the antibodies from the plasma that are attacking the nerves. Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy involves injecting the body with immunoglobulins, which are proteins that the body makes to identify and neutralise pathogens. This helps decrease the immune system’s attack on the nerves. Supportive treatment is also given and rehabilitation including physical and occupational therapy may be required. Recovery can take a long time.

The WHO says Guillain-Barré syndrome is potentially life-threatening. People with Guillain-Barré syndrome should be treated and monitored as quickly as possible and some may need intensive care. If you experience sudden muscle that gets worse over some days, see a doctor immediately.

> Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) is a rare neurological disorder where the immune system attacks the peripheral nervous system, leading to muscle weakness, paralysis, and, in severe cases, respiratory failure. While most individuals recover fully with treatment, it can be life-threatening if it affects breathing, blood pressure, or heart rate. Early diagnosis and supportive care, such as immunotherapy (plasmapheresis or IV immunoglobulin) and ventilatory support, are critical. Though rare, complications like infections or blood clots can arise. With prompt medical intervention, mortality is low, and recovery is possible, but the severity and recovery time vary among individuals.
