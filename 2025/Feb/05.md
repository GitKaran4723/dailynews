### **Critical Analysis of Delhi’s Political and Electoral Landscape**  

Delhi’s political structure is unique as it is not a full-fledged state but a Union Territory with a legislature that has limited powers. This often leads to conflicts between the Lieutenant Governor (LG), who represents the central government, and the elected government, causing administrative roadblocks. Despite these constraints, the Delhi Assembly elections remain highly significant due to the city's national prominence, large and diverse population, and its role as an economic and employment hub.

#### **Shift in Electoral Dynamics**  

1. **Welfare vs. Identity Politics:**  
   - Over the years, Delhi’s elections have increasingly been shaped by welfare concerns rather than identity-based voting patterns.  
   - AAP has capitalized on this shift by promoting subsidized water, electricity, healthcare, and education, which have resonated with the middle and lower classes.  
   - In contrast, the BJP, despite its dominance at the national level, has struggled to make significant inroads into Delhi’s governance due to AAP’s entrenched support base.  

2. **The Challenge of Governance and Corruption Allegations:**  
   - AAP’s clean governance image, which was one of its strongest assets, has suffered due to the arrests of Arvind Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia in the liquor policy case.  
   - The party’s attempt to maintain credibility through "Stand-in" CM Atishi and continued focus on welfarism reflects a defensive strategy rather than proactive governance.  

3. **BJP’s Dilemma:**  
   - The BJP, which dominates national politics, has struggled to replicate its success at the state level in Delhi.  
   - The party has attempted to counter AAP’s welfare narrative by promoting its own schemes but has not presented a strong local leadership face.  

4. **Congress’ Decline and Attempt at Revival:**  
   - The Congress, once the dominant force in Delhi, has been on the decline since AAP’s emergence.  
   - While the party is trying to regain lost ground, it has failed to make a substantial impact.  

#### **Lack of Focus on Core Issues**  

Despite the high stakes, the election campaigns have been marked by negative rhetoric and mudslinging rather than concrete solutions to pressing issues such as:  

- **Air Pollution:** Delhi’s severe pollution crisis remains largely unaddressed in political discourse, despite its direct impact on public health.  
- **Urban Infrastructure:** The city's rapid urbanization and growing migrant population require better infrastructure, but political parties have not provided detailed plans.  
- **Employment and Economy:** While Delhi is an economic hub, there is little clarity on how parties plan to boost job creation and support small businesses.  

#### **Conclusion**  

Delhi’s elections highlight the evolving nature of urban politics, where class and welfare concerns now outweigh identity-based politics. However, the lack of substantive policy debates and excessive focus on personal attacks undermine the electoral process. The electorate must navigate these political complexities and choose candidates who prioritize governance and long-term solutions over mere populism and rhetoric.

> Delhi’s Assembly elections are significant despite its limited autonomy as a Union Territory. The contest has shifted from identity-based politics to welfare concerns, with AAP securing a strong base through subsidies in water, electricity, healthcare, and education. However, corruption allegations against Arvind Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia have dented its clean governance image. The BJP, despite its national dominance, struggles to gain ground, while Congress attempts revival. Campaigns have focused more on mudslinging than key issues like pollution, infrastructure, and employment. The electorate must prioritize governance and long-term solutions over rhetoric while making their choice in these crucial elections.

# How beggar-thy-neighbour policies can make global trade come to a standstill

Beggar-thy-neighbour policies refer to protectionist economic policies adopted by governments that are aimed at benefiting a country’s economy at the expense of other countries. A trade war in which a government imposes heavy tariffs and strict quotas on the import of foreign goods into the country is the most common example of beggar-thy-neighbour policies. Central banks of countries can also engage in beggar-thy-neighbour policies through currency wars wherein they depreciate the value of their domestic currencies against foreign currencies in an attempt to boost their domestic exports and to discourage the import of foreign goods.

### Origins of the idea

The term is attributed to Scottish economist Adam Smith who first used it in his well-known 1776 book The Wealth of Nations. He coined the term to criticise mercantilists of his time who advocated protectionist policies such as the imposition of tariffs and other forms of trade barriers in order to achieve a trade surplus with other countries. The mercantilists believed that a country can grow its wealth through international trade but at the cost of impoverishing other nations. Mr. Smith, on the other hand, believed that free trade in the long-run enriches all nations engaged in such trade.

Supporters of beggar-thy-neighbour policies argue that these policies help boost a country’s domestic economy by aiding certain important industries and protecting jobs. They usually point out that countries need to protect certain industries due to national security reasons and also in order to help protect them from foreign competition during their nascent development stages. Central banks engaged in beggar-thy-neighbour policies, on the other hand, argue that depreciating the national currency will make the country’s exports look cheaper to foreigners, thus boosting exports. They also argue that a depreciation in the value of a nation’s currency will make it more expensive for domestic citizens to purchase foreign goods, thus discouraging imports. Higher exports and lower imports, in turn, are expected to lead to a trade surplus which is said to be good for the domestic economy. It should be noted that supporters of beggar-thy-neighbour policies see exports as a good thing because exports are seen as boosting demand for the goods manufactured by domestic firms. At the same time, imports are considered bad because they are seen as boosting demand for foreign firms.

### Opposing voices

Critics, however, argue that beggar-thy-neighbour policies can make all countries poorer, particularly when countries begin to retaliate against each other by imposing tit-for-tat tariffs and currency devaluations. Such tit-for-tat policies were implemented most notably during the interim period between the two major World Wars. Retaliatory tariffs and competitive currency devaluations during the period led to a significant drop in global trade and investment. In fact, economic historians consider such protectionist policies to be one of the major reasons behind the Great Depression that affected countries across the globe. In recent decades, countries such as China and Japan have been accused of devaluing their currencies to help their exporters, and to achieve a trade surplus with other major economies such as the United States. The rise of populist movements in recent years, particularly in the United States under Donald Trump’s presidency, has led to renewed fears that we could see the return of tit-for-tat economic policies that caused global trade to come to a standstill.

It should be noted that beggar-thy-neighbour policies are generally targeted at benefiting domestic producers and their workers who possess significant political influence rather than consumers, who are in fact severely harmed by such policies. For example, U.S. President Trump’s latest tariffs this week against Chinese imports are expected to help American producers who may now likely face lesser competition from Chinese firms. However, the same tariffs and other trade barriers are expected to affect American consumers who will now likely have to pay higher prices for goods due to reduced foreign supplies. Similarly, when a central bank depreciates the exchange value of its currency by flooding the forex market with its currency, it puts more domestic currency in the hands of foreigners, thus reducing the purchasing power of domestic consumers who will now be able to purchase fewer domestic goods.

Some critics of beggar-thy-neighbour policies also argue that countries should not retaliate when a foreign country imposes tariffs or other trade barriers on their exporters or devalues its currency in order to favour its own domestic exporters. They believe that countries that adopt unilateral free trade can avoid the damage caused by retaliatory tariffs, and in fact even benefit from the protectionist policies of other countries. Take the case of a country like China that is hit by tariffs imposed by the United States. While U.S. tariffs would make life hard for Chinese producers, imposing retaliatory tariffs against U.S. goods will only make things worse for China because Chinese consumers will then have to pay more for goods and services imported from the U.S. Retaliatory tariffs can thus turn out to be a double whammy for China. Similarly, according to this view, if the U.S. Federal Reserve depreciates its currency to boost its exports, it would be best for the Chinese central bank to avoid competitive devaluation because the U.S. Federal Reserve is actually subsidising Chinese consumers.

### **How Beggar-Thy-Neighbour Policies Can Bring Global Trade to a Standstill**  

#### **Understanding Beggar-Thy-Neighbour Policies**  
Beggar-thy-neighbour policies refer to economic strategies where one country attempts to improve its own economic conditions at the expense of others. These policies often involve **tariffs, import restrictions, competitive currency devaluation, and trade barriers**, which are intended to boost domestic industries but can lead to retaliation from other nations.  

Such measures were notably observed during the **Great Depression of the 1930s** and more recently in the **U.S.-China trade war**, where protectionist policies disrupted global supply chains and trade balances.  

---

### **Impact on Global Trade**  

1. **Trade Retaliation and Protectionism**  
   - When one country imposes **high tariffs or trade restrictions**, affected countries often **retaliate** with similar measures.  
   - This results in an escalating **trade war**, reducing international trade volume.  
   - Example: The **U.S.-China trade war (2018-2020)** led to billions of dollars in lost trade due to retaliatory tariffs on goods like steel, electronics, and agricultural products.  

2. **Disruption of Supply Chains**  
   - Global trade relies on **interconnected supply chains**.  
   - Protectionist policies force companies to **seek alternative suppliers**, leading to **higher costs and inefficiencies**.  
   - Example: The **semiconductor shortage** in 2021 was worsened by trade restrictions, affecting industries worldwide, including automobile and electronics manufacturers.  

3. **Currency Wars and Inflation**  
   - Countries may **devalue their currency** to make exports cheaper and imports costlier.  
   - However, if multiple countries follow this strategy, it **destabilizes exchange rates**, leading to **global inflation** and reduced investment confidence.  
   - Example: The **competitive devaluation during the 1930s** contributed to prolonged economic downturns worldwide.  

4. **Decline in Economic Growth**  
   - Reduced global trade **hurts economic growth**, especially for export-dependent economies.  
   - It affects employment, industrial production, and consumer purchasing power.  
   - Example: During the **Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act (1930)**, U.S. tariffs led to a global economic slowdown as countries retaliated, worsening the Great Depression.  

5. **Collapse of Multilateral Trade Agreements**  
   - Protectionist policies weaken international **trade organizations like the WTO**, reducing trust in **global trade frameworks**.  
   - Countries may resort to **bilateral or regional agreements**, fragmenting global trade.  

---

### **Conclusion**  
Beggar-thy-neighbour policies **disrupt trade, fuel retaliation, and slow economic growth**, ultimately **bringing global trade to a standstill**. Sustainable trade policies must focus on **cooperation, fair competition, and open markets** rather than short-term national gains. Strengthening **multilateral trade mechanisms**, promoting **fair trade practices**, and avoiding **unilateral protectionist measures** are essential to maintaining a **stable and prosperous global economy**.

> **Beggar-thy-neighbour policies**—such as **tariffs, trade restrictions, and currency devaluation**—aim to boost a country's economy but often lead to **retaliation, trade wars, and global economic slowdown**. These measures disrupt **supply chains, increase inflation, and weaken multilateral trade agreements**, reducing overall global trade. Historical examples, like the **Great Depression and U.S.-China trade war**, show how protectionism can stall economic growth and worsen financial crises. If nations prioritize **short-term gains over cooperation**, global trade could come to a **standstill**, harming all economies. To ensure stability, countries must focus on **fair trade, open markets, and multilateral agreements** rather than protectionist policies.

# Cess and surcharge continue to shrink States’ tax share

### **Cess and Surcharge: A Challenge to Fiscal Federalism in India**  

India follows a **quasi-federal structure**, where financial relations between the Centre and the States play a crucial role in governance. A major issue in recent years has been the increasing use of **cess and surcharge** by the central government, which has led to a shrinking share of tax revenue for States. This trend is adversely affecting fiscal federalism, limiting the financial autonomy of States, and creating dependency on central grants.  

---

### **Understanding Cess and Surcharge**  

1. **Cess**: A tax levied for a specific purpose, such as the Education Cess, Health Cess, or Swachh Bharat Cess. Revenue from cess must be used for the stated purpose.  
2. **Surcharge**: An additional charge on taxpayers, usually imposed on higher income groups or specific goods. Unlike cess, surcharge revenue goes directly into the Consolidated Fund of India and does not have a pre-defined usage.  

The key issue is that **revenues collected from cess and surcharge are not shared with States**, unlike normal taxes which are divided based on the Finance Commission’s recommendations.  

---

### **Impact on Fiscal Federalism**  

1. **Declining States' Share in Central Taxes**  
   - The **Finance Commission recommends** the division of net proceeds of central taxes between the Centre and States.  
   - However, with cess and surcharge not included in this divisible pool, the **Centre retains a larger portion** of tax revenue.  
   - Over the years, the **percentage of total revenue collected as cess and surcharge has increased**, reducing the funds available for States.  

2. **Increasing Dependence on Central Grants**  
   - Since States receive less revenue from tax devolution, they must rely on **grants-in-aid** from the central government.  
   - This reduces their financial autonomy, as grants are often tied to centrally sponsored schemes with specific conditions.  

3. **Undermining Cooperative Federalism**  
   - The Constitution envisages a **collaborative financial relationship** between the Centre and States, with equitable sharing of resources.  
   - The rising use of cess and surcharge weakens the spirit of **cooperative federalism**, making States financially dependent on the Centre.  

4. **Fiscal Stress on States**  
   - With reduced tax devolution, States struggle to fund key areas like **health, education, and infrastructure**.  
   - Many States resort to **higher borrowing**, increasing their fiscal deficits and debt burden.  

5. **Disproportionate Impact on States**  
   - Some States, particularly those with **lower per capita income**, rely more on tax devolution than wealthier States.  
   - The reduced share of taxes further deepens regional disparities and affects equitable growth.  

---

### **Way Forward**  

1. **Greater Transparency**  
   - The Centre must **reduce excessive reliance** on cess and surcharge and make tax devolution more transparent.  

2. **Finance Commission’s Role**  
   - Future **Finance Commissions should recommend capping** the proportion of total revenue collected through cess and surcharge.  

3. **Strengthening State Revenues**  
   - States need more flexibility in taxation powers and **greater say in determining tax-sharing mechanisms**.  

4. **Reviving True Federalism**  
   - The Centre and States must work together to **restore fiscal balance** and uphold the principles of **cooperative and competitive federalism**.  

In conclusion, the growing use of cess and surcharge is a serious concern for **India’s federal structure**. Ensuring a more **equitable distribution of resources** is essential for empowering States and achieving balanced economic development.

> The increasing use of **cess and surcharge** by the central government has reduced the **States’ share in tax revenues**, weakening **fiscal federalism** in India. Since **cess and surcharge are not part of the divisible tax pool**, the Centre retains a larger share, forcing States to rely on **grants-in-aid**. This reduces their **financial autonomy**, increases **fiscal stress**, and deepens **regional disparities**. To address this, **greater transparency**, **capping cess and surcharge**, and **strengthening States' taxation powers** are needed. Restoring a fair tax-sharing mechanism is crucial for maintaining **cooperative federalism** and ensuring **balanced economic development** across all States.

# The financial toxicity of cancer care in India

“Sir, I don’t have the money for the test,” said Vijay, a low-income lung cancer patient from Hyderabad. His oncologist replied, “Without the money, he has only a few months left.” The test — a 12-gene next-generation DNA sequencing panel — could have guided a life-saving treatment plan.

Genomics-informed precision medicine, or targeted therapy, offers the right treatment to the right patient at the right time, making previously untreatable cancers treatable. Yet, these breakthroughs, along with the latest treatments such as immunotherapy, monoclonal antibodies, and proton therapy, remain out of reach for many people from low and middle-income backgrounds.

Take 70-year-old Aslam, who has oral cancer. Immunotherapy for him would cost nearly ₹10 lakh annually, adding to the ₹25 lakh he has already spent over five years. His son, an IT professional, exhausted insurance, savings, and even sold their ancestral land to continue the treatment.

Financial toxicity is the least assessed and most devastating toxicity of cancer. It impacts not just the person with the disease but also his family and the following generations. From selling assets to skipping meals to afford treatment, the burden often traps thousands of families in a cycle of generational poverty that is economic, social, and nutritional in nature.

### Public and private healthcare

One of the key barriers to equitable cancer care is its cost, which includes both direct medical expenses, such as diagnostics, medicines, and hospitalisation, and non-medical expenses such as travel, lodging, and food. Afreen, a cancer patient, exemplifies this struggle: “I had ₹500. I spent ₹200 on travel and ₹200 on medicines. I have ₹100 left. How will I go home?”

Private and public insurance schemes, such as Ayushman Bharat, pay only for inpatient costs. Outpatient expenses such as diagnostic workups, post-discharge care, and follow-up tests must be paid out-of-pocket (OOP) by patients. Such expenditure constitutes nearly 50% of total healthcare costs.

India’s public health expenditure has always been less than 2% of GDP. Consequently, public hospitals often face shortages of healthcare personnel, diagnostic and treatment facilities, and essential medications. Delays in diagnostic tests and surgeries further strain the system. This burden is compounded by the fact that many cancer cases are diagnosed at advanced stages, leading to higher treatment costs and poorer outcomes.

Given the limited public health facilities, private healthcare is a thriving business. The Indian hospital market is valued at close to ₹8 lakh crore with a CAGR of 8%. Is letting private healthcare thrive going to worsen the financial toxicity of cancer?

### Addressing financial toxicity

In India, public healthcare is a State subject. To finance the direct medical cost of cancer care, some States such as Delhi, Maharashtra, Punjab, and Kerala have implemented several schemes. To support direct non-medical costs the Indian Railways and Air India offer discounted fares, whereas States such as Himachal Pradesh and Haryana provide free bus travel for cancer patients.

Additionally, efforts from NGOs and networks have also helped. For example, the National Cancer Grid has reduced the cost of 40 high-value cancer drugs by 82% through pooled procurement. The Cachar Cancer Hospital and Research Center in Assam has adopted a holistic approach to reduce OOP, along with accommodation, meals, and temporary employment opportunities for caregivers accompanying patients.

Only a strong political will and strategic investment in the public health system will address the financial toxicity of cancer. However, until government spending on public health improves, nonprofits play a crucial role in reducing this problem. By working at the grassroots level and conducting pilot projects, they can generate evidence that governments can scale up to inform policies.

In India, nearly 3 lakh nonprofits are registered on the Darpan portal managed by NITI Aayog, with over 85,000 focused on health and family welfare. But only a fraction of these specialise in cancer care. Larger nonprofits work across the cancer care continuum, from prevention to treatment. Smaller ones often operate in niche areas, such as by assisting low-income patients with paperwork, securing funding, and arranging essentials.

Individual philanthropy, impact investments, and corporate social responsibility (CSR) funding are central to financing nonprofits. Under India’s CSR Act of 2014, companies meeting certain criteria must allocate funds for social causes. In 2022–23, the healthcare sector received over ₹6,800 crore in CSR funding. However, granular data on specific areas like cancer remains limited.

The Forbes’ 2024 report showed that the combined wealth of India’s 100 richest individuals surged to ₹8.4 lakh crore. A growing segment of the population has surplus wealth that can be donated while they benefit from tax exemptions. Critical catalytic capital would enable younger nonprofits to establish themselves and scale their impact. However, individual philanthropy is lagging far below its potential.

With a rising pollution, rapid urbanisation, and unhealthy lifestyle changes, the health and financial toll of cancer is set to rise significantly. Indian philanthropy, CSR initiatives, government funding, and nonprofits hold the power to alleviate the economic burden of cancer care.

> Cancer treatment in India imposes a severe financial burden on patients, often leading to **financial toxicity**, where high costs deplete savings, push families into debt, or force treatment discontinuation. The high expenses stem from costly medicines, diagnostics, hospital stays, and prolonged care. Despite government schemes like Ayushman Bharat, gaps in coverage leave many struggling. Out-of-pocket expenses remain high, particularly for advanced treatments. The lack of widespread health insurance and inequitable access to care worsen the crisis. Strengthening public healthcare, expanding insurance coverage, and regulating drug prices are crucial to making cancer treatment more affordable and accessible in India.

# The U.S.’s WHO exit, a chance to reshape global health

On January 20, 2025, the United States government issued an executive order to withdraw from membership of the World Health Organization (WHO). This has raised apprehensions that reduced funding for WHO would impact the functionality of the organisation. However, as the executive decision by the U.S. government has already been made, it is time to reflect on some fundamental questions such as why a single country’s exit from WHO is causing so much concern. How can the U.S.’s exit from WHO be converted into an opportunity to create a stronger WHO? Why is there a need for an increasingly greater role of countries in Asia and Africa in global health.

### Funding intricacies

To understand the impact of the U.S.’s withdrawal on WHO funding, we need to understand WHO’s funding system. There are two broad categories of funding sources. In the first, the assessed contribution (or AC) is a fixed amount each WHO member-state must pay annually as a sort of membership fee. This is what the U.S. President has argued as being disproportionately high (for the U.S.) and cited as one of the four reasons for the U.S.’s decision regarding its withdrawal. The assessed contributions ensure assured funding, which WHO uses to pay the salaries of regular staff, both technical and administrative, and maintain day-to-day functioning. This is the minimum resources the organisation needs to ensure a continuity of operations.

The other funding pool is from voluntary contributions (or VC) which comes from a range of donor agencies and additional contributions from WHO member-states. VCs are broadly for projects and other time-bound activities. WHO uses VC funds in the hiring of short-term staff and consultants. However, the problem with VC funds is that these are — as the name suggests — voluntary, always time-bound, linked to specific activities, and, thus, unpredictable.

For example, many member-states and donors provide funds for polio elimination, patient safety, primary health care or antimicrobial resistance-related work. These contributions are tight-jacketed and non-transferable to other activities. With the U.S.’s withdrawal from WHO, the VC would also be impacted, as many U.S.-based or U.S.-aligned donors may either reduce, or worse, completely stop the funding to WHO. As an example, the ongoing turmoil and uncertain fate of USAID would additionally impact WHO funding. Clearly, the financial impact on WHO is likely to be far greater than the direct share of the U.S. government funds for WHO.

Another argument given for the U.S.’s withdrawal, which has been used frequently by some others to criticise WHO, is that the organisation is highly bureaucratic, acts slow and is in need of urgent reforms. This is partially true and to be fair in assessment, every global institution needs some reforms and WHO is not any different. In fact, there is far more to WHO’s credit than the occasional systemic blips it has faced. In this era of emerging and multi-sectoral challenges such as antimicrobial resistance, climate change, global warming and animal health, increasing re-emergence of diseases and a steep rise in lifestyle diseases, the world needs a stronger WHO, more than ever.

### Why institutions fail

In their book, Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty, Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson (they were conferred the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2024) hypothesize, inter alia, that nations thrive upon the foundation and the strengths of functioning and stronger institutions.

Expanding the analogy at a global level, the world needs stronger institutions for peace and global health. However, in the last few decades, the fibres of global collaboration have been damaged. There is rising nationalism in many countries and ‘Nation first’ is becoming a vote-catcher for many leaders. This phenomenon of hyper-nationalism is global but relatively new, and, thus, arguably more virulent in high-income countries. Hyper-nationalism often undermines global institutions.

With the U.S.’s exit from WHO, the likelihood of key multi-country alliances such G-7, G-20 and others stepping in to support and fund WHO are feeble. Yet, for its tremendous body of work in the last 75 years, it is a moral imperative for all countries that the alternatives are explored to protect and save global institutions. The legitimate governments and elected political leaders in the global south and countries such as India, Brazil, South Africa, Thailand, Egypt and many others need to step up to support WHO in specific, and the United Nations in general.

There is another important consideration — the inexcusable gap in global health priorities and funding. The health challenges which affect the countries in Asia and Africa are grossly underfunded; mPox did not get global attention till it started affecting people in high-income countries in 2022. The vaccines and drugs against mPox are barely available in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and other settings where disease is most rampant but offered liberally in the U.S. which has a few mPox cases. This is a reminder that high-income countries continue to shape the policies, health agenda and command influence in global health, inadvertently widening health inequities. Global health has arguably been a case of ‘He who pays the piper calls the tune’.

The decision to recall U.S. government personnel who have been seconded to WHO and subsequent apprehension that such a step would slow down ongoing programmes reflect how global health agencies are a little too dependent on subject experts originating from a single or select few countries. Global health will be better off if a pool of subject experts in various areas of public health are available from different countries and in the majority of the countries. There are a few things which should be considered immediately.

### The global south must act

First, countries in the global south, especially Asia and Africa, must team up to supplement WHO funding gap after the U.S.’s exit. BRICS could be one such platform. Second, countries such as India, Ethiopia, Ghana, and others in the global south need to invest in training of experts not just in public health but also global health (these are different areas). For example, India should have trained experts in conditions which affect Africa and diseases which are not prevalent in our country. The era of providing only financial support to any country is behind us. It is time for ‘pooled’ technical expertise in health, as in any other sector). Third, the countries in the global south should set up a few premier institutions at the country or at regional levels through inter-country collaboration to train their experts in global health. It is the expertise from low- and middle-income countries which will be of help to each other and to WHO by the secondment of such experts. That way, global health can improve at a much lower cost than by expertise from high-income countries.

Fourth, we have been hearing of reforms in WHO for a long time. One of the steps which should be considered urgently is to trim staff and move the headquarters to one of the regional offices in Brazzaville (Congo), Cairo, Manila or New Delhi. This would reduce the headquarter’s operational costs. Though this might be a problem in terms of air connectivity, the time and the focus of WHO’s work needs to be on geographies where attention is needed: Africa and Asia. It would be a very strategic move to scale down the headquarters and move specific divisions to the regional offices.

It is very likely that four years later or some time in future, when there is a new U.S. President, the U.S. would rejoin WHO. However, till then, the U.S.’s withdrawal should be explored as an opportunity for the public health community and political leadership in the global south to initiate country and regional level and collaborative actions to reshape the global health agenda, which is much under the influence and the guidance of high-income countries. Global health should not be at the mercy of funding or the expertise from one or a handful of high-income countries. It must be truly a joint venture for the entire world, led by the global south.

> The U.S.'s decision to exit the World Health Organization (WHO) under the Trump administration created an opportunity to rethink global health governance. The move highlighted concerns over WHO’s handling of pandemics and its dependence on major donors. While the exit weakened global cooperation, it also prompted discussions on reforming WHO to improve transparency, funding mechanisms, and crisis response. Countries, including India, gained a greater role in shaping global health policies. The Biden administration later rejoined WHO, but the episode underscored the need for a more resilient, inclusive, and independent global health system to tackle future pandemics effectively.

### **Conclusion**  

The U.S.-China trade war continues to impact global markets, with India standing at a crossroads between risks and opportunities. While economic uncertainty and trade disruptions pose challenges, India has a chance to attract investment and strengthen its global trade position. Long-term strategies, such as improving infrastructure and policy reforms, will determine India’s ability to benefit from this geopolitical shift.

> The U.S.-China trade war has intensified, with China retaliating against U.S. tariffs by imposing duties and investigating companies like Google. This conflict disrupts global trade, impacting economies worldwide. For India, it presents both challenges and opportunities—economic uncertainty and supply chain disruptions may hurt industries, but India can attract investment as companies look for alternatives to China. The trade war also fosters U.S.-India collaboration in technology and manufacturing. Globally, it contributes to economic slowdown, supply chain realignments, and rising protectionism. India’s ability to capitalize on this shift depends on strategic reforms and infrastructure improvements to boost its trade position.

# U.S. deports Indians as Trump tightens immigration rules.

### **U.S. Deportations of Indians Amid Stricter Immigration Policies: An Analysis**  

The United States has witnessed a significant rise in the deportation of Indian nationals in recent years, particularly under the administration of former President Donald Trump. The tightening of immigration policies, aimed at curbing illegal immigration and enforcing stricter border controls, has had a profound impact on many Indian migrants, particularly those who entered the U.S. illegally or overstayed their visas.  

#### **Reasons for Increased Deportations**  

1. **Stricter Immigration Policies:**  
   The Trump administration introduced a series of executive orders and regulations to restrict illegal immigration. Measures such as the “zero tolerance” policy, enhanced border security, and the expansion of deportation programs led to the arrest and removal of thousands of undocumented migrants, including Indians.  

2. **Increased Vetting and Visa Regulations:**  
   The U.S. imposed tighter scrutiny on H-1B and other work-related visas, reducing the chances for Indian professionals to obtain legal status. Those who failed to meet updated requirements were forced to leave.  

3. **Border Crackdowns and Asylum Restrictions:**  
   Many Indians, particularly from Punjab and Haryana, attempted to enter the U.S. through Mexico by claiming asylum. However, changes in asylum policies, including the "Remain in Mexico" policy, made it harder for them to secure refuge, leading to increased deportations.  

4. **ICE Raids and Detention Centers:**  
   U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) intensified its operations, conducting raids on workplaces and communities. Many undocumented Indians were detained and deported as a result.  

#### **Impact on Indian Migrants**  

1. **Humanitarian Concerns:**  
   Many deported individuals faced harsh conditions in detention centers, with reports of inadequate healthcare, overcrowding, and delayed legal proceedings.  

2. **Economic Loss and Uncertainty:**  
   Indian professionals, students, and undocumented workers who were deported suffered financial setbacks, as they had invested heavily in their American dreams.  

3. **Effect on India:**  
   Deportations led to social and economic consequences in India, particularly in states like Punjab, where illegal migration is common. Families that had spent large sums on agents and travel were left in distress.  

#### **Conclusion**  

The U.S. deportation of Indian nationals under Trump's immigration policies highlights the challenges of illegal migration and the need for a fair immigration system. While the Biden administration has relaxed some policies, issues like visa backlogs and undocumented migration remain critical areas of concern. India and the U.S. must work together to create legal avenues for migration and protect the rights of affected individuals.

> The U.S. deported a significant number of Indians under Trump's strict immigration policies, which focused on curbing illegal migration, tightening visa regulations, and increasing border security. Many Indians, particularly asylum seekers and undocumented workers, faced deportation due to stricter enforcement by ICE. This led to humanitarian concerns, financial losses, and distress for affected families in India. The deportations also highlighted flaws in the U.S. immigration system and the risks of illegal migration. While the Biden administration has eased some policies, visa backlogs and undocumented migration remain key challenges, necessitating stronger cooperation between India and the U.S. for legal migration pathways.
