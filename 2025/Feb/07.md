# Centre plays down U.S. handling of deportees

The recent deportation of 104 Indian nationals from the United States has sparked significant discourse concerning the treatment of deportees and the diplomatic dynamics between India and the U.S. This event, executed via a U.S. military aircraft, has elicited varied responses from the Indian government and opposition parties.

Background

On February 5, 2025, a U.S. military plane transported 104 Indian migrants to Amritsar, India. These individuals had entered the U.S. illegally and were deported as part of the Trump administration's stringent immigration policies. The deportees originated from various Indian states, including Punjab, Gujarat, Haryana, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, and Chandigarh. The group comprised 19 women and 13 minors, with the youngest being a four-year-old boy. 

Government's Stance

India's External Affairs Minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, addressed the issue in Parliament, stating that the deportation process adhered to existing U.S. regulations, which permit the use of restraints during such operations. He emphasized that these procedures have been in place since 2012 and noted that women and children among the deportees were not restrained. Jaishankar assured that the Indian government is engaging with U.S. authorities to ensure that returning deportees are not mistreated during flights. He also highlighted the necessity of cracking down on illegal migration while facilitating legitimate travel. 

Opposition's Reaction

Opposition lawmakers in India expressed strong disapproval of the alleged mistreatment of deportees. Reports indicated that many deportees were handcuffed and had their legs chained during the flight, leading to accusations of degrading treatment. Congress party members demanded a discussion in Parliament and sought clarification from the government regarding the measures taken to address the issue. Some lawmakers staged symbolic protests by wearing handcuffs and carrying placards reading "Humans, not prisoners." 

Diplomatic Considerations

The deportation occurred shortly before Prime Minister Narendra Modi's scheduled visit to Washington, where he is expected to discuss immigration issues with President Donald Trump. The timing has led to speculation about the diplomatic implications of the deportations. Analysts suggest that India's cooperation in accepting deportees may be influenced by its desire to maintain favorable trade relations with the U.S. and to ensure continued access to H-1B visas for skilled Indian workers. Additionally, there is concern that non-cooperation could lead to potential trade tariffs from the U.S. 

Human Impact

The personal stories of the deportees underscore the human cost of illegal migration. Many individuals, such as Daler Singh from Punjab, invested significant sums—often through loans or by mortgaging assets—to pursue better opportunities in the U.S. Their deportation not only results in financial loss but also carries social stigma upon returning to their communities. Singh recounted being handcuffed and shackled throughout the journey, describing the experience as humiliating. 

Conclusion

The Indian government's measured response to the U.S. handling of deportees reflects a complex interplay of upholding citizens' rights, addressing illegal migration, and maintaining diplomatic relations. While the government emphasizes adherence to established procedures and the importance of combating illegal migration, the opposition and civil society highlight the need to ensure the dignity and humane treatment of deported individuals. This incident underscores the broader challenges nations face in balancing domestic concerns with international diplomacy in the realm of migration and human rights.

# On the appointment of ad-hoc judges to High Courts

To address the growing backlog of criminal cases, the Supreme Court on January 30, allowed High Courts to appoint retired judges on an ad-hoc basis, provided they hear only criminal appeals as part of a Bench led by a sitting judge. A Bench of Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sanjiv Khanna and Justices B.R. Gavai and Surya Kant relaxed a rule set in Lok Prahari Through Its General Secretary S.N. Shukla IAS (Retd.) vs Union of India (2021), which had limited such appointments to High Courts where judicial vacancies exceeded 20% of the sanctioned strength.

### How are ad-hoc judges appointed?

Article 224-A, introduced by the Constitution (Fifteenth Amendment) Act, 1963, allows the appointment of retired judges to High Courts on an ad-hoc basis. Such appointments require the consent of both the retired judge and the President of India. These judges receive allowances as determined by the President’s order and exercise the same jurisdiction, powers, and privileges as a sitting High Court judge. The detailed procedure for such appointments is outlined in the 1998 Memorandum of Procedure (MoP).

### When are such appointments made?

In Lok Prahari, the Court identified specific circumstances that could warrant the appointment of ad-hoc judges in certain High Courts. At the time, nearly 40% of judicial positions across all High Courts were vacant. The Court also referred to Law Commission reports from 1979, 1988, and 2003, which advocated for the temporary appointment of retired judges as an effective measure to address the mounting backlog of cases. However, the Supreme Court expressed concerns that Article 224A could result in “inaction in making recommendations” for regular judicial appointments. Consequently, the Court clarified that ad-hoc judges can only be appointed when recommendations for filling less than 20% of vacancies have not been made, after considering both the number of sitting judges and the pending proposals for judicial appointments.

The Court outlined several “trigger points” for such appointments, although the list is not exhaustive. These include — 1) if vacancies in a High Court exceed 20% of its sanctioned strength; 2) if cases in a specific category have been pending for more than five years; 3) if more than 10% of the High Court’s cases are pending for over five years; 4) if the case disposal rate is lower than the rate at which new cases are filed (case clearance rate). The Court also recommended that each Chief Justice form a panel of retired judges, along with soon-to-retire judges, for appointments.

### What does the latest order say?

The CJI-led Bench noted that, as of January 25, there are 62 lakh pending cases across High Courts, according to data from the National Judicial Data Grid. Of these, over 18.2 lakh are criminal cases, while more than 44 lakh are civil cases. To tackle this growing pendency, the Court decided to set aside the condition laid down in Lok Prahari, which permitted the appointment of ad-hoc judges only when judicial vacancies exceeded 20% of the sanctioned strength.

It further ruled that ad-hoc judges can only hear criminal appeals. Additionally, the number of ad-hoc judges cannot exceed 10% of a High Court’s sanctioned judicial strength, meaning each High Court can have only 2 to 5 such appointments.

### Have there been prior instances?

There have only been three documented instances of ad-hoc judicial appointments. In 1972, Justice Suraj Bhan was appointed to the Madhya Pradesh High Court shortly after his retirement to adjudicate election petitions. Justice P. Venugopal was similarly appointed to the Madras High Court in 1982. More recently, in 2007, Justice O.P. Srivastava was appointed to the Allahabad High Court to preside over the Ayodhya title suits.

> To address the significant backlog of cases in India's High Courts, the Supreme Court has recently permitted the appointment of ad-hoc judges under Article 224A of the Constitution. This provision allows retired High Court judges to be temporarily appointed to assist in managing pending cases. The Supreme Court has relaxed previous conditions, enabling High Courts to appoint up to 10% of their sanctioned strength as ad-hoc judges, focusing primarily on long-pending criminal appeals. These ad-hoc judges will serve alongside sitting judges to expedite case resolutions. This initiative aims to enhance judicial efficiency and reduce delays in the justice delivery system. citeturn0search5
