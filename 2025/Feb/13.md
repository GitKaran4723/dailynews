# Governor gives nod to Ordinance on MFIs

The **Karnataka Micro Loan and Small Loan (Prevention of Coercive Actions) Ordinance, 2025** was promulgated to regulate microfinance operations and prevent coercive loan recovery practices in Karnataka. The ordinance includes the following key provisions:

1. **Prohibition of Coercive Recovery Methods**: The ordinance bans the use of pressure, violence, or other coercive methods by microfinance companies or lenders during loan recovery processes.

2. **Penalties for Violations**: Violations of the ordinance can result in imprisonment of up to 10 years and fines up to ₹5 lakh. 

3. **Protection for Vulnerable Groups**: The ordinance aims to protect economically vulnerable groups, including farmers, women, and women's self-help groups, from predatory lending practices. 

4. **Complaint Mechanism**: Borrowers can file complaints against errant microfinance companies with the jurisdictional police, who are mandated to register the case without refusal. Additionally, civil courts are barred from entertaining suits or proceedings against borrowers for loan recovery. 

5. **Validity and Legislative Process**: The ordinance is valid for six months and was promulgated despite the upcoming budget session being less than a month away. The government has assured that the bill will be debated in both Houses of the legislature before its enactment. 

**Polity Perspective on Ordinances**

In the Indian constitutional framework, an ordinance is a temporary law promulgated by the executive branch when the legislature is not in session. The President of India has the power to issue ordinances under Article 123 of the Constitution, while the Governor of a state can do so under Article 213. These provisions enable the executive to address urgent situations that require immediate legislative action.

However, the ordinance-making power is subject to certain limitations:

1. **Legislative Competence**: The executive can only promulgate ordinances on subjects within the legislative competence of the Parliament (for the President) or the State Legislature (for the Governor).

2. **Necessity and Urgency**: Ordinances should be issued only when immediate action is necessary, and the legislature is not in session to enact laws.

3. **Parliamentary Approval**: An ordinance must be laid before the legislature when it reassembles and will cease to operate if not approved within six weeks.

The use of ordinances has been a subject of debate, with concerns about their potential for misuse to bypass the legislative process. The Supreme Court of India has held that re-promulgation of ordinances without placing them before the legislature constitutes a "fraud on the Constitution" and subverts the democratic legislative process.

In the context of the Karnataka ordinance on microfinance institutions, the Governor exercised the ordinance-making power to address immediate concerns over coercive lending practices, with the assurance that the matter will be deliberated in the forthcoming legislative session.

> The **Karnataka Micro Loan and Small Loan (Prevention of Coercive Actions) Ordinance, 2025** aims to regulate **microfinance institutions (MFIs)** and curb **coercive loan recovery practices**. It bans harassment, imposes **strict penalties** (up to ₹5 lakh fine and 10 years imprisonment), and provides **legal protection** to vulnerable groups. Borrowers can file complaints with the police, and civil courts cannot entertain loan recovery suits. The ordinance, valid for **six months**, will be debated in the legislature. **From a polity perspective**, ordinances (Article 213) address urgent issues but require **legislative approval** within six weeks, preventing misuse of executive power.

# Budgeting for a gender-inclusive ‘Viksit Bharat’

The Union Budget 2025-26 emphasises the government’s commitment to inclusive development, balanced growth and prioritising the well-being of four key population groups: the poor, youth, farmers, and women. In a welcome announcement, the Finance Minister set forth a holistic vision for Viksit Bharat (or Developed India) with ‘zero poverty, universal good quality school education, 100% skilled labour with meaningful employment, 70% women in economic activities, and India as the food basket of the world.’ The explicit inclusion of women as a priority group within this national development framework is commendable and reinforces the government’s pledge towards women-led development.

### Gender budget allocation

One of the most notable advancements in the Budget is the increase in the gender budget to 8.8% of the total Budget, a significant jump from 6.8% in the previous year. This is the highest allocation in two decades, with ₹4.49 lakh crore spread across 49 Union Ministries and departments. It reflects a strong commitment to creating a more supportive and empowering environment for women and girls. Further strengthening this commitment, 12 additional central Ministries — many from non-conventional sectors such as railways, ports, shipping and waterways, land resources, pharmaceuticals, and food processing industries — have integrated gender budgets, reflecting a whole-of-government approach to gender mainstreaming.

As in the Periodic Labour Force Survey, India’s female labour force participation rate (FLFPR) measured at usual status has steadily risen, reaching approximately 42% in 2023-24 from 33% in 2021-22. This is approaching the global average of 47%, as reported by the International Labour Organisation. However, a 37-percentage point gap remains when compared to men’s labour force participation of 79%. Achieving the ambitious target of 70% women’s participation in economic activities by 2047 necessitates increased investment in skilling, employment, entrepreneurship, access to productive resources, and social security entitlements — areas that the Budget has acknowledged through its various schemes. Key initiatives such as the Skill India Programme, Entrepreneurship and Skill Development Programme (ESDP), National Skill Training Institutes, Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana-National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM), the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), PM Employment Generation Programme, PM Vishwakarma, and Krishonnati Yojana have seen a combined increased allocation from ₹1.19 lakh crore to ₹1.24 lakh crore this year. Approximately 52% of these funds are directed toward women and girls. Additionally, new schemes such as the Prime Minister Dhan-Dhaanya Krishi Yojana, first-time entrepreneurs’ scheme, sustainable livelihood for urban workers initiative, and Centres of Excellence for Make in India, will play a critical role in fostering women’s workforce participation.

### A focus on gig workers

With 90% of India’s working women engaged in the informal sector, the Budget’s proposal to formalise gig workers by issuing identity cards and registering them on the e-Shram portal is a significant step. This initiative has the potential to empower millions of women by providing them with formal identity, access to social security entitlements, and financial inclusion benefits.

While the gig economy has offered women financial independence and flexible work arrangements, it often comes with low wages, job insecurity, and a lack of employment rights, including maternity benefits. The enforcement of labour codes and the provision of comprehensive social security measures, including progressive parental entitlements across informal and formal sectors, will be critical to ensure women’s economic security.

The establishment of a Centre of Excellence on Artificial Intelligence (AI) for the education sector and a dedicated ₹600 crore gender budget under the India AI Mission, demonstrate the government’s intent to harness AI for social good. As technological advancements redefine the future of work, investing in digital education, skills, and enterprise training for women will be imperative to ensuring equitable outcomes in the workforce and benefits for the entire economy.

### A diversity of economic roles

Financial institutions must recognise women’s diverse economic roles, particularly in agriculture, entrepreneurship, and employment. For example, simplifying documentation requirements for economic and social security provisions, such as delinking Kisan Credit Cards from land ownership, would help women farmers avail loans and credit facilities that they can use to improve crop yields, productivity and expand their agricultural and allied operations. Tracking access and usage of such schemes through gender-disaggregated data would further enhance their effectiveness.

As per the government’s Udyam portal, 20.5% of the micro, small and medium enterprises are women-owned employing about 27 million people. Unlocking finance for women-owned enterprises through collateral-free loans, alternative credit scoring models, and targeted financial literacy programmes will catalyse economic growth. Bain and Company, and Google, claim that establishing 30 million additional women-owned businesses could generate 150-170 million jobs, accounting for over 25% of the job creation needed for India’s working-age population by 2030.

Budget 2025-26 provides a robust foundation for advancing women’s economic participation. Realising the vision of Viksit Bharat requires sustained efforts in policy implementation, infrastructure development, and social norm transformation. By ensuring gender-responsive budgeting, strengthened social protection, and by fostering a labour market which includes both women and men, India can pave the way for women to become key drivers of national growth, ultimately achieving the ambitious target of 70% women in economic activities by 2047.

# Should convicted persons contest elections?

The Supreme Court is hearing petitions filed by Ashwin Upadhyay and others, seeking a life time ban on convicted persons from contesting elections.

### What are the legal provisions?

Section 8(3) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 (RP Act, 1951), provides for the disqualification of a person convicted of a criminal offence and sentenced to imprisonment for not less than two years. Such a person is disqualified from contesting elections for a further period of six years from the date of release. Section 8(1) further stipulates that a person convicted under criminal laws for heinous crimes like rape; the Protection of Civil Rights (PCR) act for preaching or practice of untouchability; UAPA for unlawful association; Prevention of Corruption Act etc., will be disqualified irrespective of the period of their sentence and six years after release.

### What were past decisions?

The Supreme Court has delivered notable judgments in favour of the decriminalisation of politics. In the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) case (2002), it mandated the disclosure of criminal records of all candidates contesting elections. In the CEC vs Jan Chaukidar case (2013), it upheld the creative interpretation of the provisions of the RP Act, 1951 by the Patna High Court. One of the qualifications as per the act to contest elections is that a person should be an ‘elector.’ Section 62(5) stipulates that a person in jail is not eligible to vote in elections. The court interpreted that persons who are under trial prisoners, therefore cease to be ‘electors’ and hence not qualified to contest elections. However, the Parliament amended the act in 2013 to overturn this judgment allowing under trial prisoners to contest elections. In Lily Thomas (2013), the court struck down section 8(4) of the RP Act, 1951, that allowed a sitting legislator to continue as a member even after being convicted if they filed an appeal, as unconstitutional and against political justice. After this judgment, a sitting legislator is disqualified immediately after the sentencing for a conviction.

It is pertinent to note that Section 11 of the RP Act, 1951 provides that the Election Commission (EC) may remove any disqualification or reduce the period of disqualification of a convicted person. It utilised this power in September 2019, to reduce the disqualification period of Prem Singh Tamang, incumbent Chief Minister of Sikkim, from six years to 13 months which allowed him to contest and win a byelection.

It was a questionable decision of the EC to have reduced the disqualification period of a person convicted under the Prevention of Corruption Act, considering its various recommendations to curb criminalisation of politics.

### What is the current petition?

The current petition seeks a life time ban on convicted persons from contesting elections. The petitioners argue that if a convicted person is not eligible for even a junior-grade government job, how could they become law makers six years after serving their sentence. However, the Central government in an affidavit filed before the court in 2020 had mentioned that MPs and MLAs are not bound by any ‘service conditions’ unlike government servants, and hence the present disqualification period of six years after serving the sentence is adequate.

The Supreme Court has again sought the response of the Central government and the EC on the current petition.

### What can be the way forward?

A report by ADR states that 251 (46%) of the 543 elected MPs in 2024, have criminal cases against them, and 171 (31%) face serious criminal charges including rape, murder, attempt to murder and kidnapping. It added that chances of winning for a candidate with a criminal background was 15.4% as against just 4.4% for a candidate with a clean background. The Law Commission in 1999 and 2014, and the EC on various occasions have highlighted the need to curb the criminalisation of politics. They have recommended that even persons against whom charges are framed by a competent court for an offence that entails punishment of more than five years should not be allowed to contest elections.

However, there has been no consensus on this recommendation amongst political parties considering the risk of its misuse. As regards the current petition, there may be convictions that do not involve moral turpitude for which permanent disqualification would be inappropriate and disproportionate. With respect to convictions for heinous crimes and under statutes like the Prevention of Corruption Act, there may be a case for life time disqualification as it is directly linked with probity in public life.

Meanwhile, the powers vested with the EC for reducing or removing the period of disqualification of a convicted person should be reviewed by the court for its constitutional validity.

> The issue of **convicted persons contesting elections** raises concerns about **ethical governance, democracy, and public trust**. Under **Section 8 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951**, individuals convicted of crimes with **two or more years of imprisonment** are disqualified from contesting elections. However, legal loopholes and delays in conviction allow **criminals to enter politics**. Allowing convicted persons undermines **democratic integrity, weakens governance, and erodes public faith in institutions**. To ensure **clean politics**, reforms like **fast-track courts, stricter disqualification rules, and electoral transparency** are needed. Only **law-abiding candidates** should represent the people for a corruption-free democracy.
