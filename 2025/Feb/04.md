# The cause and effects of the U.S.’s withdrawal from WHO

### **The Cause and Effects of the U.S.’s Withdrawal from WHO**  

The United States' withdrawal from the **World Health Organization (WHO)** has been a subject of intense global debate. The decision, primarily taken during the Trump administration in 2020, was driven by concerns over WHO’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and its alleged bias toward China. However, the withdrawal had significant geopolitical, health, and economic consequences.

### **Causes of U.S. Withdrawal from WHO**  

1. **Alleged WHO Bias Toward China**  
   - The U.S. accused WHO of **failing to hold China accountable** for the early spread of COVID-19.  
   - Claims were made that WHO **delayed crucial warnings** about human-to-human transmission of the virus.  

2. **Criticism of WHO’s COVID-19 Response**  
   - The U.S. criticized WHO’s **slow response** to the pandemic and its **delayed declaration of a global emergency**.  
   - It argued that WHO **failed to push China for transparency** in virus origins.  

3. **Funding Disputes**  
   - The U.S. was the **largest financial contributor** to WHO, providing nearly **15% of its budget**.  
   - Concerns arose over **misuse of funds** and lack of accountability in WHO’s spending.  

4. **Geopolitical Strategy and Nationalism**  
   - The withdrawal was also part of the **"America First"** policy, aimed at reducing U.S. reliance on international organizations.  
   - The U.S. sought to **redirect funds toward domestic healthcare initiatives** instead of WHO contributions.  

### **Effects of U.S. Withdrawal from WHO**  

1. **Weakened Global Health Response**  
   - WHO faced **financial strain**, affecting its ability to manage health crises like COVID-19, Ebola, and other pandemics.  
   - The withdrawal **reduced U.S. influence** in global health policies, allowing countries like China to expand their role.  

2. **Impact on Vaccine Distribution**  
   - WHO’s **COVAX initiative**, aimed at providing vaccines to poorer nations, suffered due to reduced U.S. funding.  
   - Global vaccine distribution slowed, especially in developing countries.  

3. **Increased Geopolitical Tensions**  
   - The move **deepened tensions between the U.S. and China**, as China increased funding to WHO.  
   - It led to **a decline in U.S. credibility in global health leadership**.  

4. **Domestic and International Backlash**  
   - **Public health experts** in the U.S. criticized the decision, arguing it weakened America’s ability to fight global pandemics.  
   - **Allied nations, including the EU, opposed** the withdrawal, stressing the need for global cooperation in health crises.  

5. **Reversal of Decision**  
   - Under President **Joe Biden**, the U.S. **rejoined WHO in 2021**, restoring funding and influence.  
   - The reversal highlighted the **political nature of the withdrawal** rather than a strategic long-term decision.  

### **Conclusion**  
The U.S.’s withdrawal from WHO was driven by **political, financial, and geopolitical concerns** but had **negative consequences for global health governance**. It weakened pandemic response efforts, strained WHO’s finances, and created diplomatic tensions. The reversal under Biden underscored the importance of **global cooperation in health emergencies** and reaffirmed the U.S.’s role in international health leadership.

> The U.S. withdrew from the **WHO** in 2020, citing **bias toward China, mismanagement of COVID-19, and funding disputes**.

# The kind of jobs needed for the ‘Viksit Bharat’ goal

The Union Budget has been presented, and this is the right time to outline the three kinds of jobs this writer believes India must create. Beyond reviving private consumption in urban areas, we must continue to strengthen long-term job creation and real wage growth across India.

The 2024 Budget had introduced **Employment Linked Incentives (ELI)** under the Prime Minister’s five-scheme initiative, designed to create over four crore jobs over five years with a central outlay of ₹2 lakh crore. The **Prime Minister’s internship scheme** saw significant traction in 2024, with 6.21 lakh applications for 1.27 lakh opportunities. The outcomes on the rest four — beyond a draft Cabinet note on ELI and meetings by DPIIT with the Ministry of Labour and CII, remain to be seen. But there must be more deliberation on the kind of jobs we wish to create for a Viksit Bharat.

### Impact of climate change

First, climate-resilience. India was the seventh most-affected country by climate change in 2019, having suffered an income loss of $159 billion in 2021, and according to the Reserve Bank of India, will face adaptation costs of nearly $1 trillion by 2030. The impact on agricultural and labour productivity and also livelihoods requires exponentially higher levels of funding for building rural and urban adaptation capabilities and the rejuvenation of local ecosystems to boost job creation.

To meet the net-zero targets by 2070, the Government must create and incentivise jobs which are “climate-resilient” by maximising all “co-benefits” (IPCC). This could mean providing three to four state-subsidised e-rickshaws in about 6,00,000 villages to create about two million jobs (focused on women drivers), also improving last-mile mobility. Or, there can be new ways to enable private investment in compressed biogas plants to bridge the gap of 82 plants set-up versus the target of 5,000 set (for FY23-24) in 2018. Or, even accelerating achieving the 500GW non-fossil energy capacity target to create over one million jobs, with stronger support for decentralised and rooftop solar which can be seven times more labour-intensive (CEEW).

### On AI resilience

Second, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-resilience. With the rise of generative AI, numerous jobs now have 50-plus% automation potential. Scenarios by McKinsey Global Institute show that 50% automation adoption in India can happen in the next 10 years. India’s IT and business services, which comprised 70-plus% of services exports (Economic Survey 2021), hope to create millions skilled talent exports. But their employment potential can be limited in the gen AI-era as labour gets costlier relative to capital. With the launch of metaGPT simulating software companies, AI writing 25% of Google’s code, and layoffs due to chatbots even in India, new jobs will also need to prioritise physical engagement and utilise our human ‘creativity’, which this writer terms as AI-resilience. This can take the form of larger education and health budgets to plug the deficit of millions of health-care professionals and teachers across states or dedicated financing for the National Rural Livelihood Mission to facilitate global and urban market linkages of local products, crafts, and knowledge of farmers and artisans in rural India.

### Being aspiration-centric

Third, being aspiration centric. Despite their growing engagement with the startup culture, rural youth continue to have low confidence due to deeper insecurities from poor foundational education (this includes English) and resource-deprived upbringing. This can reinforce dependency on government jobs and ‘coaching’ to ‘crack’ entrance exams. As their aspirations are shaped by their socio-economic backgrounds, digital media, and interaction of the ‘Samaaj, Sarkaar, and Bazaar’, the slow growth of non-farm jobs warrants off-farm job-creation which responds to these dynamic aspirations.

This can take the form of rapid infrastructure development such as building around 70,000 integrated pack-houses, plugging the 95-plus% infrastructure gap, to create over two million jobs. Or, boosting productivity and value-addition for high import/export-share items and tech-enabled local manufacturing of agri-inputs. Greater use of tech, social media, and rebranding the ‘rural’ can also help make off-farm jobs aspirational for India’s youth. One clear avenue is accelerating the ‘National Mission on Edible Oils – Oilseeds’ to reduce India’s 57% import-dependence of edible-oil back to the pre-WTO levels with the revitalised rural processing of native oilseeds like soybean, sunflower (about 40% of edible-oil imports), and boosting retail of in-vogue cold-pressed oils. Enabling creation of many such large-scale businesses with private-public partnerships and investments, can address economic aspirations of our disheartened youth protesting examination leaks and low recruitment vacancies.

While tax relief may temporarily boost urban consumer demand, amidst growing household indebtedness and suboptimal private investment trends, the Centre can demonstrate greater commitment for long-term structural reforms which create these climate-resilient, AI-resilient and aspiration-centric jobs. Many opportunities exist as we embark towards our shared vision of a Viksit Bharat.

### **The Kind of Jobs Needed for the ‘Viksit Bharat’ Goal**  

India’s goal of becoming a **‘Viksit Bharat’ (Developed India) by 2047** requires a robust employment strategy focused on innovation, sustainability, and inclusivity.

# Amid global tumult, rupee breaches 87 against dollar

**Amid Global Tumult, Rupee Breaches 87 Against Dollar**  

1. **Introduction**  
   - The Indian rupee has weakened past the 87 mark against the US dollar, reflecting global economic uncertainties.  
   - This depreciation is attributed to a mix of international and domestic factors, including economic policies, trade imbalances, and investor sentiments.  

2. **Global Factors Driving Rupee Depreciation**  
   - **US Federal Reserve's Monetary Policy**: The Fed’s aggressive interest rate hikes have strengthened the US dollar, leading to capital outflows from emerging markets like India.  
   - **Geopolitical Instability**: Ongoing conflicts, including the Russia-Ukraine war and tensions in the Middle East, have disrupted supply chains, increasing crude oil prices and affecting India’s import bill.  
   - **Recession Fears in Major Economies**: Concerns over economic slowdowns in the US, China, and the Eurozone have resulted in global risk aversion, with investors moving toward safer assets like the US dollar.  
   - **Strengthening of the US Dollar Index (DXY)**: The dollar index, which measures the US dollar’s performance against a basket of currencies, has risen, causing pressure on emerging market currencies.  

3. **Domestic Factors Influencing Rupee Depreciation**  
   - **Widening Current Account Deficit (CAD)**: India’s trade deficit has expanded due to higher imports and weaker exports, leading to increased demand for foreign currency.  
   - **High Crude Oil Prices**: India is a major oil importer, and rising oil prices have contributed to greater dollar outflows, worsening the exchange rate.  
   - **Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI) Outflows**: With rising US interest rates, foreign investors are pulling out capital from Indian equity and debt markets, leading to rupee depreciation.  
   - **Slowdown in Domestic Economic Growth**: Lower-than-expected GDP growth and concerns over fiscal deficit have added to investor pessimism.  

4. **Impact of Rupee Depreciation**  
   - **Inflationary Pressures**: A weaker rupee makes imports more expensive, especially crude oil, electronics, and machinery, leading to higher inflation.  
   - **Increased Cost of Borrowing**: External debt repayments in dollars become costlier, affecting Indian corporates with dollar-denominated borrowings.  
   - **Worsening Trade Deficit**: Exporters may benefit, but the overall trade imbalance due to high import costs negatively impacts the economy.  
   - **Pressure on Foreign Exchange Reserves**: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) may intervene by selling dollars from its forex reserves, reducing reserve levels.  
   - **Weaker Consumer and Investor Confidence**: Currency depreciation often leads to stock market volatility and lower business confidence.  

5. **RBI and Government’s Response**  
   - **Monetary Policy Measures**: The RBI may intervene in forex markets by selling dollars and tightening liquidity.  
   - **Boosting Exports and Trade Policies**: Incentives for export-driven industries could be introduced to reduce the trade deficit.  
   - **Encouraging Capital Inflows**: The government may ease foreign direct investment (FDI) norms and issue sovereign bonds to attract foreign capital.  
   - **Crude Oil Import Strategies**: Agreements for cheaper oil imports from alternative suppliers can be explored to manage trade imbalances.  

6. **Conclusion**  
   - The rupee’s decline past 87 against the dollar is a reflection of both global economic trends and domestic challenges.  
   - Strategic policy interventions, economic reforms, and prudent fiscal management are crucial to stabilizing the rupee and sustaining long-term economic growth.

> The Indian rupee has depreciated past 87 against the US dollar due to global and domestic factors. Rising US interest rates, geopolitical tensions, and economic slowdowns have strengthened the dollar, triggering capital outflows from India. Domestically, a widening current account deficit, high crude oil prices, and foreign investor exits have further weakened the rupee. This depreciation increases inflation, raises borrowing costs, and pressures foreign exchange reserves. The RBI and government may intervene through monetary measures, trade policies, and capital inflow incentives. Addressing structural economic challenges is crucial to stabilizing the rupee and ensuring long-term financial stability.

# Some wind behind the sails of India’s shipping industry

The government deserves credit for its commitment to develop the maritime sector, largely neglected by predecessor governments. This is reflected in the expenditure on the government’s flagship programme, Sagarmala, which, as on September 2024, had outlined 839 projects requiring an investment of ₹5.8 lakh crore by 2035. Of these, 241 projects, worth ₹1.22 lakh crore, have been completed, while 234 projects, valued at ₹1.8 lakh crore, are under implementation. Additionally, 364 projects, with an estimated investment of ₹2.78 lakh crore, are in various stages of development.

Within Sagarmala, ₹2.91 lakh crore (over 50%) is allocated for port modernisation; ₹2.06 lakh crore (more than 35%) for port connectivity; ₹55.8 thousand crore (10%) for port-led industrialisation, the remaining 5% distributed between coastal community development, infrastructure for coastal shipping (not ship acquisition) and inland water transport.

India’s economy has seen GDP rising from ₹153 trillion in 2016-17 to ₹272 trillion in 2022-23 — an increase of 43%, growing at a CAGR of 7%, despite two years of COVID-19 related setbacks. The economy is projected to reach $3.7 trillion this year, $5 trillion by 2027, and $7 trillion by 2030.

During this period, India’s EXIM trade has also grown from $66 billion in 2016-17 to $116 billion in 2022, a cumulative increase of over 77% and an annual growth rate of 12.83%. India aims to boost exports to $2 trillion by 2030, to strengthen its global trade position.

### The industry continues to face stagnation

Despite high economic growth and increased investments in the maritime sector, the Indian shipping industry has remained stagnant. According to statistics by the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways, the cargo handled at major ports has only marginally increased from 1,071.76 million tons in 2016-17 to 1,249.99 million tons in 2020-21 — a cumulative growth of 14.26% or an annual increase of just 2.85%. In contrast, the number of vessels handled at these ports has actually declined by 5.93%, from 21,655 vessels in 2016-17 to 20,371 in 2020-21.

In terms of Indian-registered ships, the number has increased from 1,313 in 2016-17 to 1,526 in September 2024 — a cumulative rise of 16.77% and an average annual growth of 2.4%. Over the same period, gross tonnage has grown from 11,547,576 GT in 2016-17 to 13,744,897 GT — a cumulative increase of 17.44% and an annual average growth of 2.5%.

A major concern has been the aging Indian fleet, with the average vessel age rising to 26 years in 2022-23. However, this has now improved to 21 years, with the addition of 34 relatively younger vessels (average age of 14 years) in 2024. In comparative terms, India’s global ranking in ship ownership declined from 17 to 19, highlighting the need for reforms.

Clearly, the assumption that increased investment in ports would automatically drive growth in Indian shipping has been proven wrong.

In reality, Indian shipping has continued to lose market to foreign-flag vessels in carrying Indian EXIM cargo and to rail and road transport for domestic cargo. The reason is simple: the needs of shipowners and shipbuilders are vastly different from those of port and terminal operators.

### Multiple challenges such as in shipbuilding

Indian shipping faces multiple challenges hindering its competitiveness: lack of capital and high borrowing costs; short loan tenures, rigid collateral requirements requiring shipowners additional security instead of using ships as collateral; limited understanding of the industry’s cyclical nature, leading to inflexible loan restructuring policies; unfavourable taxation laws often favouring foreign-flag vessels over Indian vessels even within Indian waters; delays in repatriating funds for ship acquisitions; stringent regulatory requirements, and additional financial burdens on mandatory training of Indian seafarers and higher port charges, further eroding competitiveness.

In contrast, ships registered in tax havens or flags of convenience — benefit from easier access to capital, lower borrowing costs, lenient regulatory standards, concealed ownership structures, and minimal regulatory oversight. This makes Indian-flagged vessels significantly less competitive in global shipping markets.

Beyond capital constraints, India’s shipbuilding industry also struggles with: inadequate infrastructure for constructing large vessels; high input costs, particularly on steel; a weak ancillary industry leading to dependency on imports; customs duties on imported machinery and spare parts, increasing production costs, and skill gaps that limit workforce efficiency.

Additionally, funding challenges for shipowners and delays in new-build vessel deliveries deter potential buyers from investing in Indian shipyards, further weakening the domestic shipbuilding sector.

The Indian National Shipowners Association has for long advocated measures to ease capital constraints and eliminate discriminatory tax policies. Two key recommendations, i.e., the creation of a Maritime Development Fund (MDF) and granting infrastructure status to ships, were incorporated into the Maritime India Vision 2030. Additionally, industry stakeholders have been pushing for the removal of the 5% IGST on ship capital costs and the exemption of Indian seafarers from TDS requirements.

Except for tax-related relief, most of the industry’s long-standing demands appear to have been addressed in the Union Budget.

The government has announced: a ₹25,000 crore MDF; Infrastructure status for large vessels; facilitation of shipbuilding clusters; a 10-year extension of the basic customs duty exemption on shipbuilding spares and equipment; a revamped financial assistance policy for shipbuilding; credit incentives for shipbreaking in Indian yards, and an extension of the tonnage tax scheme to inland vessels.

However, the devil lies in the details. The government’s contribution to the MDF will only be 49%, with the remainder to come from major ports. It is unclear whether the ₹25,000 crore will be mobilised in a single year or over multiple years. Given the high capital intensity of shipping, shipbuilding, and port sectors, this amount may still fall short of industry needs.

The aging Indian shipping fleet requires urgent replacement, and greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets will necessitate investments in green technology. The sector requires long-term financing with lower interest rates and repayment tenures of 7-10 years. Additionally, India needs new shipyards to build large vessels and the expansion and modernisation of existing ones. Although Sagarmala has infused funds in ports, additional funds may still be necessary for modernisation, despite transitioning to a landlord model.

If the MDF is strategically utilised to attract external commercial borrowings (ECBs) at lower interest rates, it could help bridge the funding gap across the maritime sector.

### Glaring tax disparities

The Budget appears to have missed a crucial opportunity to address the tax disparities that put Indian ships at a comparative disadvantage to foreign ships, even when operating along the Indian coast. Indian-flagged vessels are subject to a 5% IGST on purchase price, a levy not imposed on foreign-flagged ships. Additionally, Indian shipping companies must deduct tax at source (TDS) on seafarers’ salaries, whereas foreign vessels employing Indian seafarers face no such obligation.

The Budget 2025 is a promising step but must not become another half-measure in the name of shipping reforms. The industry needs decisive action, not just incremental progress.

> India’s shipping industry is gaining momentum with policy support and infrastructure expansion. The government has introduced incentives for domestic shipbuilding, reduced logistics costs, and promoted coastal shipping. Initiatives like **Gati Shakti**, **Sagarmala**, and tax reforms aim to boost efficiency and global competitiveness. However, challenges remain, including high capital costs, dependence on foreign vessels, and limited indigenous manufacturing. Strengthening maritime infrastructure, increasing private investments, and reducing reliance on imports are crucial. With strategic planning, India can emerge as a major player in global shipping, reducing trade deficits and enhancing economic resilience in the maritime sector.

# Green and clean

### **Green and Clean: India’s Need for a Just and Equitable Critical Minerals Framework**  

#### **Introduction**  
India has made significant progress in transitioning to cleaner energy sources over the past decade. This shift is evident in the budgetary allocations for the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), which increased from ₹1,535 crore in 2015 to ₹32,626 crore in 2025. However, these allocations have often been underutilized. The country’s push for renewable energy has been met with both challenges and successes, highlighting the need for a well-structured and equitable critical minerals framework to sustain its energy transition.

#### **Renewable Energy Push and Budgetary Trends**  
The past decade has seen a sharp increase in budgetary allocations to renewable energy, reflecting India’s commitment to clean energy. The PM-KUSUM scheme, launched in 2019 with an outlay of ₹34,422 crore, aimed to install off-grid solar irrigation pumps and solar plants on fallow farmland. However, the scheme received a lukewarm response, achieving less than half a gigawatt of installed capacity.  

The real push for renewables came during the COVID-19 pandemic when global supply chain disruptions exposed India’s vulnerability to coal, oil, and gas imports. In response, India pledged at COP26 (2021) to generate 50% of its energy from renewable sources by 2030. This commitment was further reinforced in the Union Budget 2021, which allocated ₹18,100 crore for a Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme to enhance India’s advanced chemistry cell manufacturing capacity, crucial for grid-scale battery storage. Another ₹4,500 crore PLI scheme for solar photovoltaic modules was expanded to ₹19,500 crore in 2022.  

#### **Challenges in Renewable Energy Adoption**  
Despite significant investments, India continues to face several challenges in its clean energy transition:  

1. **Dependence on Imports**  
   - The imposition of a **40% Basic Customs Duty (BCD) on solar modules** and **25% on solar cells** was aimed at reducing dependence on Chinese imports. However, this led to increased prices, slowing down solar power installations.  
   - India still relies heavily on imports for key components like **lithium-ion batteries**, which are essential for energy storage.  

2. **Coal Dominance in Power Generation**

However, the extraction and distribution of these minerals must be **socially and environmentally just** and **equitable** in access and benefits.  

1. **Social and Environmental Justice in Extraction**  
   - Mining of critical minerals must be **sustainable**, ensuring minimal environmental degradation.  
   - India must adopt **best global practices** to ensure **fair compensation to local communities** affected by mining.  

2. **Reducing Dependence on China**  
   - China currently dominates the supply chain of **lithium-ion batteries and rare earth elements**.  
   - India must **diversify supply sources**, invest in **domestic mineral exploration**, and enter **strategic partnerships** with other mineral-rich countries.  

3. **Equitable Distribution of Resources**  
   - The government must ensure **fair access** to critical minerals for all stakeholders, including **small and medium enterprises (SMEs)**.  
   - A policy framework should prevent **monopolization** and ensure **transparent pricing mechanisms**.  

#### **India’s Global Leadership Opportunity**  
With the United States withdrawing from its leadership role in critical minerals and energy transition policies, India has a **strategic opportunity** to take a leadership position. It can:  
- **Collaborate with international organizations** to set standards for sustainable mining.  
- **Develop a regional alliance** with mineral-rich nations to secure long-term supply chains.  
- **Leverage its G20 Presidency** to push for global cooperation in clean energy technologies.  

#### **Conclusion**  
India’s clean energy transition is at a critical juncture. While significant progress has been made, challenges such as dependence on imports, slow infrastructure development, and coal reliance remain. A **just and equitable critical minerals framework** is essential to ensure a **sustainable**, **cost-effective**, and **inclusive energy future**. By **reducing dependence on China**, ensuring **sustainable extraction**, and playing a **leading global role**, India can emerge as a **self-reliant and resilient clean energy powerhouse**.

> India has made significant strides in renewable energy, with increased budget allocations and schemes like PM-KUSUM. However, challenges persist, including high import dependence, coal reliance, and cost pressures. The government imposed tariffs on solar imports but later exempted 12 critical minerals to boost local production. A **just and equitable critical minerals framework** is essential for sustainable extraction and fair distribution. Reducing dependence on China and securing mineral supply chains is crucial. With the U.S. stepping back, India has an opportunity to lead in clean energy policy globally. Strategic planning and sustainable mining can make India a self-reliant energy powerhouse.

# How will the govt. produce the required fuel ethanol?

Union Minister Nitin Gadkari said that India will achieve its target of 20% ethanol blending of petrol in the next two months, at least a year ahead of what was originally planned. This would entail the production of nearly 1,100 crore litres of fuel ethanol in one year.

### Where will this come from?

The 1,100 crore litres of fuel ethanol will come from sugar and high grade molasses, Food Corporation of India (FCI) rice, broken rice, and maize. India’s ethanol distillery capacity has ramped up to 1,600 crore litres, driven by a range of government incentives and the promise of a stable, lucrative market.

Sugar is expected to provide some 400 crore litres this ethanol year, according to Deepak Ballani, director general of Indian Sugar and Bio-energy Manufacturers Association. India had closing sugar stocks of around 80 lakh tonnes in October 2024. The projected sugar production for next year is around 315 lakh tonnes out of which 40 lakh tonnes will go to fuel ethanol. Mr. Ballani said that ethanol for non-fuel uses will come from low grade molasses called C Heavy that don’t go into sugar production.

The government recently decided to reduce the price of FCI rice to distilleries from ₹28 to ₹22.5 per kg. The government handout states that some 110 crore litres of ethanol will be produced from FCI rice this ethanol year. This means almost 400 crore litres of fuel ethanol should come from maize. For context, India was producing little or no ethanol from maize until 2020. Besides pure-play grain-based distilleries coming up, some sugar distilleries have modified to dual-feed so in the off-season they can use other feedstock (maize) to produce ethanol.

### How is maize playing a role?

India’s maize production is just about enough for traditional needs such as for the poultry sector, livestock feed, starch production and some 10% for human consumption. As the government had imposed curbs on allowing sugar and high quality molasses for ethanol production, maize imports started ramping up in April 2024. From April to June, approx. ₹100 crore worth of maize was imported while, for 2023-24, maize imports were approx. $33 million. Ministry of Commerce figures show that a total of $188 million worth of maize was imported from April to November 2024.

The promise of a steady, lucrative ethanol market has meanwhile goaded many farmers to take to maize cultivation across India. The major maize producing States are Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Bihar, and Uttar Pradesh. For the 2024-25 ethanol year, maize output would be some 42 million tonnes out of which nine million can go towards producing the 350 to 400 crore litres of ethanol, H. S. Jat, director ICAR Indian Institute of Maize Research, Ludhiana, said. Citing good prospects for kharif this year, he said importing maize will not be necessary.

Since 2020-21. when ethanol production was almost all sugar-based, maize production had increased by nearly six million tonnes in three years, for potential ethanol use.

As things stand now, maize is cultivated in 10% more area at a higher yield, says Mr. Jat who also expects some diversion from traditional maize uses since supplying to ethanol is more lucrative for farmers. On whether that won’t disrupt the market, Mr. Jat says DDGS (Distiller’s Dried Grains with Solubles), a byproduct of ethanol, can be used for poultry. The long-term sustainability of fuel ethanol would depend on whether the switch to ethanol and stress on maize has a negative impact on production of other foodgrains. Mr. Jat estimates that 100 crore litres of fuel ethanol translates to ₹6,000 crore savings on oil imports and the money going into the internal economy including to farmers. For context, India’s yearly oil import bill is some ₹10.5 lakh crore.

> The Indian government aims to boost **fuel ethanol production** to meet its **ethanol blending targets** for cleaner energy and reduced fuel imports. It is promoting **ethanol production from sugarcane, maize, and damaged food grains**, with incentives for **diversified feedstocks like agricultural waste**. The government has expanded **distilleries, bio-refineries, and financial incentives** under the Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) program. Policies like **higher procurement prices, soft loans, and subsidies** support ethanol producers. By **diversifying raw materials, improving infrastructure, and encouraging private investments**, India aims to achieve **20% ethanol blending by 2025**, enhancing energy security and reducing dependence on fossil fuels.
