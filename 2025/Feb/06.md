# Why More Indian Women Are Saying 'Not Yet' to Marriage

Introduction

Marriage has traditionally been a significant milestone in an Indian woman's life, often regarded as a fundamental duty rather than a choice. However, in recent years, an increasing number of Indian women are delaying marriage, prioritizing personal aspirations, careers, and independence. This shift reflects broader social and economic changes in Indian society, challenging conventional gender roles and redefining the notion of marriage.

Changing Societal Norms

Indian society is gradually moving away from the rigid expectations that once dictated a woman's life trajectory. Education and career opportunities have empowered women to make independent choices, reducing the pressure to conform to early marriage norms. With greater awareness of personal rights and individual aspirations, many women are redefining their priorities and questioning traditional gender roles.

Economic Independence and Career Aspirations

One of the most significant factors influencing delayed marriages is the increasing economic independence of women. Higher education and career-oriented mindsets have encouraged many to focus on professional growth before settling into marital commitments. Women today seek financial stability, personal development, and job satisfaction before considering marriage, unlike previous generations where marriage was often prioritized over individual ambitions.

Shifting Perspectives on Marriage

Unlike the past, where marriage was often seen as an obligation, contemporary women view it as a partnership based on equality and compatibility. Many now prioritize emotional and intellectual compatibility over societal expectations, preferring to wait until they find the right partner rather than succumbing to familial or social pressures.

Influence of Urbanization and Globalization

Urbanization and globalization have played a crucial role in transforming mindsets. Exposure to different cultures, liberal ideas, and progressive values has influenced young Indian women to challenge patriarchal norms. The concept of individual freedom, delayed motherhood, and prioritizing personal growth has gained acceptance, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.

The Role of Parental Support

While traditional Indian families often pushed women into early marriage, there has been a noticeable shift in parental attitudes. Many parents now encourage their daughters to pursue higher education and professional careers, recognizing that marriage should be a choice rather than a societal expectation. This changing parental outlook has allowed more women to take charge of their lives.

Fear of Unhappy Marriages

Rising divorce rates, instances of domestic violence, and gender inequality within marriage have made many women cautious about entering into matrimony. The fear of being trapped in an unhappy or oppressive marriage, without financial or emotional security, has led many to delay or reconsider marriage altogether. Women today demand respectful and equal partnerships, and many choose to wait until they find one that aligns with their values.

Legal and Social Reforms

Progressive legal reforms, such as laws against child marriage, dowry, and domestic violence, have contributed to greater autonomy for women. The right to education, equal employment opportunities, and legal protections against marital injustices have given women the confidence to delay marriage without fear of societal repercussions.

Challenges and Criticism

Despite the positive changes, women who delay marriage still face societal scrutiny, family pressure, and stereotypes that label them as too ambitious or untraditional. In rural and conservative societies, the expectation of marriage remains deeply ingrained, and women often struggle to balance personal aspirations with cultural expectations.

Conclusion

The increasing trend of Indian women delaying marriage is a reflection of a more progressive, educated, and independent society. Women are no longer bound by rigid societal norms but are instead asserting their right to choose when and whom they marry. While challenges remain, the shift towards self-determination and empowerment signifies a transformative change in India's social fabric, paving the way for a more equitable future for women.

> ### **Summary: Why More Indian Women Are Saying 'Not Yet' to Marriage**  

The trend of Indian women delaying marriage is growing due to changing societal norms, economic independence, and career aspirations. Women now prioritize personal growth, financial stability, and compatibility over societal expectations. Urbanization, globalization, and shifting parental attitudes have empowered them to make independent choices. Additionally, concerns about unhappy marriages and increasing legal protections encourage women to delay marriage until they find a suitable partner. Despite facing societal scrutiny, this shift reflects a more progressive and equitable society where women exercise greater autonomy in life decisions.

# What is the SC directive on sacred groves?

On December 18, 2024, the Supreme Court directed the Forest Department of Rajasthan to map on the ground and via satellite every ‘sacred grove’ in detail. They were to be identified irrespective of their size and based “solely on their purpose and their cultural and ecological significance to the local community”. After mapping, the court directed the department to classify them as ‘forests’ and notify them as ‘community reserves’ under the Wildlife Protection Act (WLPA) 1972. Effectively, the decision would transfer the sacred groves from community protection to forest officialdom for the purposes of conservation. The move defies the Forest Rights Act (FRA) 2006, which by virtue of being enacted later overrides the WLPA, and which the government had intended to do the reverse: i.e. recognise traditional and customary rights over all forest lands and transfer them back from the Forest Department to gram sabhas.

The sacred groves of Rajasthan, also known as ‘orans’, ‘malvan’, ‘deo ghat’, and ‘baugh’, number around 25,000 and cover about six lakh hectares of the State.

### What was the case about?

In T.N. Godavarman v. Union of India, the Supreme Court ordered that ‘forest land’ in Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, “will not only include ‘forest’ as understood in the dictionary sense, but also any area recorded as forest in the government record irrespective of the ownership of the land”. The court then directed State governments to constitute expert committees to identify areas that met this understanding of ‘forest land’.

In 2004, the expert committee report of the Rajasthan government identified only those sacred groves that fulfilled the criteria of ‘deemed forests’ — that is, trees covering 5 hectares of land with at least 200 trees per hectare were classified as ‘forests’, while the remainder was not.

The Supreme Court’s Central Empowered Committee (CEC) disagreed with this choice because it was inconsistent with the court’s definition of ‘forest land’. The CEC also said all such areas diverted for non-forestry purposes before 1980 could be exempted. The apex court agreed with the CEC and directed Rajasthan to implement the recommendations post-haste in 2018.

In early 2024, the Rajasthan government — responding to interlocutory applications seeking directions to implement this order — said that sacred groves were being identified and documented as ‘forest lands’. Ironically, the Rajasthan Forest Policy 2023 omitted the detailed framework for the protection of sacred groves specified in its 2010 policy.

The present order came in response to a challenge to these positions at the Supreme Court.

### What do sacred groves mean to communities?

Sacred groves are community-regulated and conserved patches of forest land. They are created and managed traditionally by communities in various ways deeply rooted in their identity. The groves are kept inviolate through customary laws and taboos, many of which completely prohibit the extraction of any resources in any form, except for custodians to access medicinal plants. The grove’s conservation ethos is strongly linked to piety and sanctity, enforced in terms of the community’s relationship with its spirits and gods.

India is estimated to have 1-10 lakh sacred groves of this nature — the highest in the world. They are called ‘devara kadu’ in Karnataka, ‘devban’ in Himachal Pradesh, ‘kavu’ and ‘sarpa kavu’ in Kerala, ‘sarna’ in the Chota Nagpur Plateau region, ‘devbani’ in Chhattisgarh, ‘jahera’ or ‘thakuramma’ in Odisha, ‘devgudi’ by the Muria, the Madia, and the Gond adivasis of Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh, ‘ki law lyngdoh’, ‘ki law kyntang’ or ‘ki law niam’ in Meghalaya, ‘sabarkantha’, ‘dahod’ or ‘banaskantha’ in Gujarat, and so forth.

They are often associated with temples, monasteries, shrines, pilgrim sites, and/or burial grounds. These sites are thus also repositories of various herbal medicines and gathering points for local healers, as much as they are biodiversity hotspots. They are also, frequently, sources of perennial streams that support the growth of unique and endemic flora and fauna.

Local legends, myths, and beliefs surround sacred groves, and communities have transmitted them orally through several generations as a matter of conserving their cultural identities. Communities’ relationships with their groves have also helped mitigate the effects of floods, landslides, and droughts on their lives while stabilising the soil and preventing erosion. Anthropologists have also documented the impact of sacred groves on their respective communities’ mental and physical well-being.

### What are community reserves?

The WLPA 2002 introduced the category of Protected Areas called ‘community reserves’, in addition to ‘national parks’ and ‘sanctuaries’.

Community reserves are notified over community or private land where locals have volunteered to conserve habitats to protect “fauna, flora, and traditional or cultural conservation values and practises”.

The community, or even the individual, is thus required to prevent any offences specified in the WLPA, assist the authorities in arresting any offenders, report the “death of any wild animal,” and prevent or extinguish any fires. The offences include damaging the boundary marks, teasing or molesting wild animals, littering in the community reserve, setting fires or allowing a fire to burn, and using any chemical substances that endanger wildlife.

Further, a land-use pattern within a community reserve cannot be changed without the approval of the reserve management committee and the State government. The Chief Wildlife Warden, under whose jurisdiction community reserves fall, effectively has overall control of the reserve and its management plan.

The Supreme Court’s directions also obligate the State government to constitute a ‘Community Reserve Management Committee’ to conserve, maintain, and manage the reserve and to protect wildlife and habitats. This committee is to have at least five members nominated by the gram panchayat (or members of the gram sabha if there is no gram panchayat) and a representative of the Forest or Wildlife Department in whose jurisdiction the community reserve is located. If the reserve is on private land, the committee will consist of the land owner, a representative of the Forest or Wildlife Department, and a representative of the concerned Panchayat or tribal community.

The elected chairperson of the committee will be designated the reserve’s ‘Honorary Wildlife Warden’.

The court also recommended that the Union Environment Ministry identify and map sacred groves nationwide and formulate a policy for their governance and management.

How will the Forest Department’s takeover clash with the FRA’s provisions?

If sacred groves had fallen under the FRA’s purview, they would have been part of ‘community forest resources’. According to the FRA, a community forest resource is the “customary common forest land within the traditional or customary boundaries of the village… including reserved forests, protected forests and protected areas such as sanctuaries and national parks to which the community had traditional access”.

Thus, the gram sabhas would have been the statutory authority to protect, regenerate, conserve or manage community forest resources, along with the wildlife, flora, and biodiversity within. The gram sabhas would also have been responsible for preventing activities that harm their cultural and natural heritage.

To this end, the sabha would have to constitute its own Community Forest Resource Management Committees to develop and execute the managed plan approved by the gram sabha. And State governments would be duty-bound to support these plans.

All sacred groves in forest areas are currently subsets of community forest resources, which are in turn under the jurisdiction of gram sabhas, and not the Forest or the Wildlife department. All sacred groves outside forest land, if any, also come under the FRA’s purview if a proposal to notify them as ‘forest land’ comes into being. In sum, notifying sacred groves as community reserves controlled by the Forest Department could conflict with the customs of communities, and with the community forest resources notified by the FRA, which complies with the customs by bringing them under its governance.

> In December 2024, the Supreme Court of India recognized sacred groves, known as **orans** in Rajasthan, as "deemed forests" under the Forest Conservation Act.This landmark decision mandates the Rajasthan government to map and notify these ecologically and culturally significant areas as forests, ensuring their legal protection.The Court emphasized the vital role of orans in biodiversity conservation, water recharge, and cultural heritage.additionally, it directed the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change to develop a comprehensive national policy for the governance and management of sacred groves across India, highlighting the importance of community involvement in their preservation.

# Question for the AI age: do machines and humans learn the same way?

### **Question for the AI Age: Do Machines and Humans Learn the Same Way?**  

The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has led to intriguing comparisons between human and machine learning. While both involve processing information, identifying patterns, and improving over time, their underlying mechanisms differ fundamentally.  

### **How Humans Learn**  
Humans learn through **experience, reasoning, and emotions**. Key aspects include:  
1. **Neuroplasticity:** The brain rewires itself based on experiences.  
2. **Contextual Understanding:** Learning is shaped by culture, emotions, and personal experiences.  
3. **Generalization & Creativity:** Humans can adapt knowledge to new situations and think abstractly.  
4. **Social & Emotional Learning:** Interaction and emotions play a crucial role in human learning.  

### **How Machines Learn**  
Machines learn using **algorithms and data-driven optimization**:  
1. **Pattern Recognition:** AI detects correlations in large datasets.  
2. **Supervised & Unsupervised Learning:** Models are trained using labeled or unlabeled data.  
3. **Reinforcement Learning:** AI improves through rewards and penalties.  
4. **Lack of Intuition & Emotion:** Machines rely purely on statistical processing, lacking true understanding.  

### **Key Differences**  
- **Adaptability:** Humans adapt intuitively; machines require retraining.  
- **Creativity:** Humans create novel ideas; AI generates based on patterns.  
- **Cognition & Emotion:** AI lacks consciousness, emotions, and ethical reasoning.  

### **Conclusion**  
While AI mimics learning, it does not replicate human cognition. Machines process vast amounts of data efficiently, but human learning is dynamic, intuitive, and deeply contextual. The future will likely see a synergy between human intelligence and AI, each complementing the other's strengths.

> Humans and machines learn differently. **Humans learn through experience, reasoning, and emotions**, relying on **neuroplasticity, contextual understanding, and creativity**. They adapt knowledge to new situations intuitively and engage in social learning. **Machines learn using algorithms and data-driven optimization**, identifying patterns through **supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning** but lack intuition and emotions. **Key differences** include adaptability, creativity, and cognitive depth—humans generalize and think abstractly, while AI processes data statistically. **Conclusion:** AI mimics learning but lacks consciousness and true understanding. The future will likely see human intelligence and AI complementing each other rather than replacing human cognition.

# A green signal for India to assert its health leadership

The Union Budget 2025-26 lays a robust foundation for India to assert its leadership in global health care and innovation, with strategic announcements that bolster medical infrastructure, expand educational opportunities, and promote global collaboration.

With a ₹90,958 crore health-care allocation, the addition of 75,000 medical seats over the next five years, and investments in daycare cancer centres, India is poised to enhance both accessibility and quality of care. The country will add 10,000 medical seats in FY26 alone, underscoring its commitment to health-care excellence.

### India’s health-care transformation

This Budget underscores India’s remarkable journey of progress, from the 1980s when it grappled with limited medical infrastructure, to its current status as a global health-care leader. The transformation has been nothing short of extraordinary.

Recently, the writer had the privilege of presenting two key recommendations to Prime Minister Narendra Modi: first, establishing India as the global health-care destination, and second, addressing the global shortfall of health-care professionals. It has been a delight to see both these ideas in action through the ‘Heal in India’ and ‘Heal by India’ initiatives. With streamlined visa processes, enhanced hospital infrastructure, and robust public-private partnerships, India is poised to become the preferred medical destination for international patients.

Simultaneously, the country is addressing the global shortfall of health-care professionals by training and deploying more doctors, nurses, and paramedics abroad. This will ensure that Indian expertise supports health-care systems worldwide while creating new opportunities for our skilled professionals.

### Customs duty exemptions, tech outlook

Moreover, it is commendable that the growing burden of non-communicable diseases such as cancer has been acknowledged in this Budget. The establishment of 200 day-care cancer centres in district hospitals will bring specialised treatment closer to people, improving early diagnosis and better patient outcomes.

The customs duty exemption on 36 life-saving drugs, including those for cancer, rare diseases, and chronic conditions will lower the cost of treatments, in turn, benefiting thousands of patients across the country. Also, the addition of 13 new patient assistance programmes would also improve access to critical medications for patients, particularly those with chronic conditions.

The emphasis on Artificial Intelligence and digital health marks a pivotal moment for the future of India’s health care. The new National Centres of Excellence will spearhead innovation in diagnostics, treatment, and research, enabling India to develop cutting-edge solutions that enhance patient care.

The writer believes that the introduction of cutting-edge technologies to deliver quality health care has strengthened India’s position as a global health-care player. Both private and public hospitals have played an integral role in this progress. Apollo was the first hospital to launch Proton therapy for advanced cancer care in this part of the world and continues to attract patients from countries such as Australia and the United Kingdom to name a few.

### Build on the momentum

This Budget clearly recognises the government’s vision for — and demonstration of bold leadership in recognising — health care as a pillar of national growth and development. From a country that once struggled to provide basic medical care, we have evolved into a nation offering world-class treatment to millions. Through the synergy of Heal in India, Heal by India, and innovation-driven care, we are shaping a future where India’s health-care system sets new global benchmarks.

It is our collective responsibility now to build on this momentum — by embracing technology, strengthening medical education, and ensuring that health care reaches every individual in need.

### India is not just healing its own people; it is healing the world.

# A tough call

Introduction

The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is set to conclude its first policy review of 2025 amid significantly different circumstances from its previous meeting in December 2024. This review is particularly challenging due to changes in key personnel, the depreciating rupee, and global economic disruptions. The Indian economy is facing multiple challenges, including inflation, currency depreciation, and slow GDP growth, making this policy review crucial.

Changes in Leadership

One of the key changes impacting the RBI’s decision-making is the appointment of a new Governor, Sanjay Malhotra, replacing Shaktikanta Das. Additionally, Deputy Governor Michael Patra, who was in charge of monetary policy, retired last month, leaving a temporary leadership gap. With the Centre yet to name a successor, another deputy is currently overseeing monetary policy. This transition period may influence the decision-making process, requiring the new leadership to navigate a complex economic landscape while ensuring stability.

Depreciating Rupee and Global Economic Impact

The Indian rupee has been on a steady decline, hitting 85 to the U.S. dollar on December 19, 2024, slipping further to 86 on January 13, 2025, and crossing 87 on February 3. This decline is partly attributed to a stronger U.S. dollar, which is being driven by U.S. President Donald Trump’s aggressive economic policies, including higher tariffs on major trade partners and other measures such as exiting global tax accords. A weaker rupee poses additional challenges for the RBI, as it can contribute to imported inflation, further complicating monetary policy decisions.

Economic Growth Concerns and Demand for Rate Cuts

Despite previous expectations of economic recovery, India’s GDP growth for 2024-25 has been downgraded to 6.4%. The July-September 2024 quarter had already seen a sharp growth decline to 5.4%. With no significant improvement in economic metrics during the December-ending quarter, concerns over economic stagnation persist. Industry and government stakeholders have been vocal in their demand for an interest rate cut to stimulate growth. However, such a move could further weaken the rupee, increasing inflationary pressures.

Fiscal Policy vs. Monetary Policy Debate

There has been ongoing debate between the Finance Ministry and the RBI regarding the reasons behind sluggish economic activity. The Finance Ministry has attributed weak urban demand to the RBI’s tight monetary policy. Meanwhile, RBI officials, in their January bulletin, suggested that reviving economic growth requires boosting consumption through higher disposable incomes, particularly for the urban middle class, which has been struggling with food inflation. The recent Budget aimed to address this issue through income tax cuts, shifting the responsibility back to the RBI to consider policy adjustments.

Inflation and Policy Dilemmas

Inflation has remained above 5% for the past five months but may have eased closer to the RBI’s 4% target in January. The RBI now faces a difficult choice—whether to cut rates to stimulate growth or maintain the status quo to prevent further depreciation of the rupee. A rate cut could encourage private investment and consumption but may also increase imported inflation and weaken investor confidence in the rupee.

Conclusion

The RBI’s first policy review under the new Governor presents a complex dilemma. The central bank must balance economic growth concerns, inflation control, and currency stability. Historical precedents, such as Shaktikanta Das’s unexpected rate cut in his first review in 2019, may influence the current decision-making. However, the current economic climate is more volatile, requiring a carefully calibrated approach. The decision taken in this review will set the tone for India’s monetary policy in 2025, impacting economic stability and investor confidence in the months ahead.

> The RBI’s first Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) review of 2025 faces multiple challenges, including leadership changes, a weakening rupee, and economic slowdown. New RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra must navigate policy decisions without a permanent Deputy Governor for monetary policy. The rupee’s depreciation, driven by U.S. economic policies, adds inflationary concerns. With GDP growth downgraded to 6.4%, industry demands a rate cut to boost consumption. However, inflation remains above 5%, complicating decisions. The RBI must balance economic growth, inflation control, and currency stability. This policy decision will set the course for India’s monetary stance in 2025, impacting economic confidence.
