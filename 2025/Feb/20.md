# Manipur’s worsening humanitarian crisis

The northeastern Indian state of Manipur has been engulfed in a severe humanitarian crisis since May 2023, stemming from escalating ethnic violence between the majority Meitei community and the minority Kuki-Zo tribes. This conflict has resulted in over 250 fatalities and displaced more than 60,000 individuals, leading to widespread displacement and suffering.

**Background of the Conflict**

The roots of the violence trace back to longstanding ethnic tensions exacerbated by socio-economic disparities and political demands. A significant flashpoint occurred when the Meitei community sought Scheduled Tribe status, aiming to secure affirmative action benefits such as reserved seats in government jobs and educational institutions. This move was perceived as a threat by the Kuki-Zo tribes, who feared it would undermine their own access to these limited resources. The situation deteriorated further following a Manipur High Court order in April 2023, which directed the state government to consider the Meiteis' request for Scheduled Tribe status. This judicial directive intensified existing animosities, leading to widespread protests and violent clashes. 

**Escalation of Violence**

The initial outbreak of violence in May 2023 saw homes, businesses, and places of worship being destroyed, with both communities suffering significant losses. The unrest prompted the Indian government to deploy additional paramilitary and army troops to restore order. Despite these efforts, sporadic clashes have continued, with reports of armed militias and vigilante groups exacerbating the situation. The influx of militants from neighboring Myanmar, equipped with advanced weaponry, has further intensified the conflict, leading to increased lawlessness and challenges in restoring peace. 

**Humanitarian Impact**

The protracted violence has led to a dire humanitarian situation. Displaced individuals are living in overcrowded relief camps with inadequate access to basic necessities such as clean water, sanitation, and healthcare. The prolonged displacement has disrupted livelihoods, education, and access to essential services, exacerbating the vulnerability of affected populations. Efforts by humanitarian organizations to provide relief have been hampered by ongoing security concerns and restricted access to certain areas. 

**Political Developments**

In response to the escalating crisis, N. Biren Singh, the Chief Minister of Manipur, resigned from his position in February 2025. His tenure had been marred by allegations of bias towards the Meitei community and inadequate handling of the conflict. Following his resignation, the Indian federal government imposed direct rule over the state, aiming to stabilize the situation and facilitate peace efforts. This move underscores the severity of the crisis and the challenges faced in restoring normalcy to the region.

**Challenges to Peace and Reconciliation**

Efforts to broker peace have been continually undermined by deep-seated mistrust between the communities, the presence of armed militias, and the proliferation of illegal weaponry. The state's strategic location, bordering Myanmar, has further complicated the situation, with cross-border insurgent activities and refugee influxes adding layers of complexity to the conflict. The use of unregulated communication channels, such as smuggled satellite internet devices, has also posed challenges to enforcing information blackouts intended to curb the spread of violence. 

**Conclusion**

The humanitarian crisis in Manipur is a multifaceted issue requiring a comprehensive approach that addresses immediate relief needs and the underlying causes of the conflict. Restoring peace and normalcy necessitates concerted efforts from the government, civil society, and international organizations to foster dialogue, ensure equitable resource distribution, and rebuild trust between the affected communities.

> Manipur's humanitarian crisis, escalating since May 2023, stems from violent ethnic clashes between the Meitei and Kuki-Zo communities. The conflict, triggered by Meitei demands for Scheduled Tribe status, has led to over 250 deaths and displaced 60,000 people. Violence persists despite military intervention, with displaced communities facing dire conditions in overcrowded camps. Political instability worsened as Chief Minister N. Biren Singh resigned in February 2025, prompting direct central rule. The crisis is further complicated by insurgent activities from Myanmar. Resolving the conflict requires humanitarian aid, peace talks, and long-term socio-political reforms to restore stability in the region.

# Rekha Gupta, first-time MLA, named as Delhi CM

The appointment of Rekha Gupta as Delhi's Chief Minister on February 20, 2025, marks a significant milestone in the political representation of women in India. As a first-time Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) from Shalimar Bagh, Gupta's rise to this prominent position underscores both the progress made and the challenges that persist in enhancing female participation in Indian politics.

**Historical Context of Female Political Representation in India**

India has a rich history of women in leadership roles, with figures like Indira Gandhi serving as Prime Minister and more recently, leaders such as Mamata Banerjee in West Bengal. Despite these notable examples, women's overall representation in legislative bodies has remained disproportionately low. As of 2023, women constituted only about 15.2% of the Lok Sabha (the lower house of Parliament) and 13.9% of the Rajya Sabha (the upper house). This underrepresentation is even more pronounced in state legislative assemblies, with the national average standing at a mere 9%, and no state exceeding 20% female legislators.

**Recent Legislative Measures**

In an effort to address this gender disparity, the Indian Parliament passed the Constitution (One Hundred and Sixth Amendment) Act in 2023, commonly known as the Women's Reservation Bill. This landmark legislation mandates that 33% of seats in the Lok Sabha and state legislative assemblies be reserved for women . The bill received presidential assent on September 28, 2023, and is slated for implementation following the next delimitation exercise, expected after the subsequent census.

**Challenges and the Path Forward**

While legislative measures are crucial, they are not a panacea for the deep-seated societal and structural barriers that hinder women's political participation. Issues such as patriarchal norms, lack of access to education and resources, and the prevalence of proxy candidates—where women are elected in name but male relatives wield actual power—continue to impede genuine female empowerment in politics 

The ascent of leaders like Rekha Gupta serves as an inspiration and highlights the potential for change. However, achieving substantial and lasting progress requires a multifaceted approach:

- **Grassroots Mobilization**: Encouraging and supporting women at the local levels to participate in politics can create a pipeline of capable female leaders.

- **Educational and Financial Support**: Providing resources and training can empower women to contest elections and effectively serve in public office.

- **Cultural Shift**: Addressing and challenging societal norms that discourage or restrict women's participation in politics is essential for long-term change.

In conclusion, while the appointment of Rekha Gupta as Delhi's Chief Minister is a commendable step forward, it also underscores the ongoing need to actively promote and support women's representation in all political spheres across India.

> Rekha Gupta’s appointment as Delhi’s Chief Minister marks a milestone in female political representation in India. Despite notable women leaders, overall representation remains low, with women comprising only 15.2% of the Lok Sabha and 9% in state assemblies.
