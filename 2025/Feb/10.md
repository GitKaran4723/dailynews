# Biren quits as Manipur CM after meeting Shah

Manipur Chief Minister N. Biren Singh resigned from his position following a meeting with Union Home Minister Amit Shah in New Delhi. Upon returning to Imphal, he submitted his resignation to Governor Ajay Kumar Bhalla, who accepted it and requested that Singh continue in office until alternative arrangements are made.

**Reasons for Resignation:**

Singh's resignation is primarily attributed to prolonged ethnic violence in Manipur, which has resulted in over 250 deaths and displaced approximately 60,000 people since May 2023. The conflict involves tensions between the majority Meitei community and the minority Kuki-Zo tribes. The Meiteis' demand for Scheduled Tribe status, which would grant them economic benefits and job quotas, has been a significant point of contention, leading to widespread unrest. Singh, being a Meitei, faced accusations from Kuki groups of bias and complicity in the violence, allegations he has consistently denied. Additionally, there was a looming threat of a no-confidence motion against his government by the opposition Congress party in the upcoming assembly session. 

**Constitutional Provisions and Subsequent Procedures:**

The resignation of a Chief Minister is addressed under Article 164 of the Indian Constitution, which states that the Chief Minister is appointed by the Governor and holds office during the Governor's pleasure. However, in practice, a Chief Minister's term is contingent upon maintaining the confidence of the state's legislative assembly. If the Chief Minister loses this confidence, they are expected to resign. 

Upon the resignation of the Chief Minister, the entire Council of Ministers is deemed to have vacated office, as the Council is collectively responsible to the legislative assembly. The Governor then has the responsibility to ensure the continuity of governance. Typically, the Governor may:

1. **Appoint a New Chief Minister:** If a clear successor is evident, such as the leader of the majority party or coalition in the legislative assembly, the Governor can invite them to form the government.

2. **Impose President's Rule:** If no party or coalition can demonstrate a majority, the Governor may recommend the imposition of President's Rule under Article 356 of the Constitution, leading to the suspension of the state's legislative assembly and direct governance by the central government.

In the interim, the outgoing Chief Minister may be requested to continue as a caretaker to manage day-to-day administrative functions until a new government is established. This caretaker role is limited in scope, focusing solely on routine matters and avoiding major policy decisions.

In Manipur's case, Governor Bhalla has asked N. Biren Singh to continue in a caretaker capacity until alternative arrangements are made. The next steps will depend on the political dynamics within the state's legislative assembly and the Governor's assessment of who can command a majority to form a stable government.

> Manipur Chief Minister N. Biren Singh resigned following a meeting with Union Home Minister Amit Shah amid ongoing ethnic violence in the state. The conflict, primarily between the Meitei and Kuki-Zo communities, has caused over 250 deaths and mass displacement. Singh submitted his resignation to Governor Ajay Kumar Bhalla, who accepted it and asked him to continue as caretaker CM until a new government is formed. As per Article 164 of the Indian Constitution, the Governor will either invite a new leader to form the government or recommend President's Rule if no clear majority emerges in the legislative assembly.

# India’s opportunity at the AI Action Summit

In early January, India accepted France’s invitation to co-chair the AI Action Summit on February 10 and 11 in Paris. This summit will be the third of its kind, following meetings focussed on AI safety in the U.K. (2023) and South Korea (2024). In addition to AI safety, the agenda at Paris is to focus on innovation, public interest AI, future of work, and AI governance issues — presenting India an opportunity to continue its global engagement on AI safety and also amplify the voice of the Global South on broader AI issues.

This article outlines how India can leverage the opportunity to advance three key priorities for the Global South. Doing this well could also strongly position India to host the next such summit, which brings together decision makers on AI policy, industry at the forefront of AI development, and civil society representatives for an inclusive dialogue on AI.

### Voice of the Global South

The first meeting in Bletchley Park focussed on the safety of ‘frontier AI models’, the emerging risks of AI, and launched the U.K. AI Safety Institute (AISI). The second meeting in Seoul expanded the scope of the conversation to multilateral collaboration on AI risk management through a network of AISIs with countries/blocs such as the U.S., France, Singapore, Japan, and the European Union. With ministerial and high-level bureaucratic representation through the meetings, India has actively engaged in the global discourse on AI safety. As a next step, India’s IT Minister recently announced plans of setting up an AI Safety Institute.

In other multilateral fora with leadership roles, India has championed the cause for the Global South, which has not leveraged the transformative potential of AI as much as more developed parts of the world have. Under India’s presidency in 2023, the G20 endorsed a “pro-innovation regulatory/governance approach” to balance AI innovation and the need to develop guardrails for AI. Soon after, the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI) meeting hosted by India in December 2023 emphasised the need for “equitable access to critical resources for AI research and innovation” to underscore the need for enabling AI infrastructure for developing AI applications.

### Priorities in Paris

India’s vision for the Global South could now benefit from the broad agenda of the Paris meeting. To maximise this opportunity, India should focus on three key strategic priorities. First, India must advocate for democratising access to AI resources across the entire AI value chain. While India’s domestic initiative of establishing a common computing facility with over 18,600 GPUs and 40% government subsidy sets a compelling example, the scope must expand beyond computing hardware. This includes ensuring equitable access to data sets, data storage infrastructure, cloud computing platforms, foundation models, and application development platforms. In addition, India should promote distributed computing solutions, an alternative to traditional computing infrastructure, and access to innovative safety tools like watermarking technology.

The promotion of open-source AI models deserves particular attention. DeepSeek’s success demonstrates both the potential of open-source models and the need to address export control measures that currently constrain AI model development. India must advocate for more flexible cross-border transfer of AI technologies while maintaining appropriate safety standards.

Second, India should call for developing a framework for identifying and prioritising AI use-cases relevant to the Global South’s unique contexts. This approach ensures that AI applications serve local needs rather than becoming solutions in search of problems. Instances include early disease detection systems adapted to local healthcare infrastructure, personalised learning platforms that account for diverse educational contexts, and agricultural productivity tools calibrated to regional farming practices. The establishment of an AI use-case repository following the summit could provide guidance for the Global South in determining its priorities.

Third, India must emphasise the importance of contextualising AI risks and safety measures for the Global South. The challenges faced by developing nations often differ significantly from those of the Global North. Cultural erosion through exposure to large language models trained on “western data” represents one such unique risk. The Yoshua Benjio-led expert report on International Scientific Report on the Safety of Advanced AI highlights that risk is derived from the “probability of an occurrence of harm and severity of that harm.” Risks are thus future looking but grounded in already occurred harm. In Paris, India must thus call for collecting evidence of AI-related harms, grounded in Global South contexts, to inform their risk mitigation strategies. A repository of AI-related harms could also help inform any future regulatory approaches of the Global South.

### Looking ahead

As co-chair of the Paris meeting, India must leverage its position to advance the key AI priorities of the Global South. Doing so would also position India as an ideal candidate to host the next AI Action Summit, which would ensure continued focus on the Global South perspective on AI. This would, in turn, cement India’s role as bridge between the AI superpowers in the Global North and developing nations catching up in the global AI sphere.

> The **AI Action Summit**, co-hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on February 10-11, 2025, in Paris, presents a significant opportunity for India to influence global AI discourse. India aims to advocate for the concerns of the Global South, emphasizing the need for AI tools to be safe, trustworthy, and equitably accessible. The summit will address themes such as public interest AI, the future of work, innovation and culture, trust in AI, and global AI governance. India's participation underscores its commitment to ethical AI development and its role in shaping international AI policies.

nalysis of Budget 2025-26 Announcements on Research and Development

The Union Budget 2025-26 has introduced a significant boost to India's research and development (R&D) sector, with an unprecedented allocation of ₹20,000 crore towards the development of small modular reactors (SMRs) and an overall increase in the Department of Science and Technology (DST)'s budget to ₹28,000 crore. This initiative, which aims to establish five SMRs by 2033, is a notable step towards enhancing India’s capabilities in nuclear energy and sustainable technology. However, while the increased funding appears promising, its effective utilization remains a pressing concern.

Challenges in India's R&D Sector

Despite being home to a burgeoning technology sector spanning fuel, metallurgy, pharmaceuticals, textiles, IT, and biotechnology, India’s core R&D output and intellectual property generation have not kept pace with global advancements. A primary factor behind this stagnation is the historically low participation of the private sector in R&D funding. Government-driven initiatives have predominantly shaped scientific advancements, with private sector contribution standing at only 36%. In 2020, India’s overall R&D spending was just 0.64% of GDP, marking the lowest investment in R&D since 1995.

Moreover, data from the DST suggests that public sector R&D units allocated a mere 0.30% of their sales turnover to research, compared to 1.46% by private sector enterprises in 2020-21. These statistics indicate that while businesses are increasing their R&D investments, the public sector lags in directing sales revenues into innovation. The government’s massive budgetary infusion is a welcome move, but it raises the question: will these funds be efficiently absorbed?

Key Areas of Concern

Infrastructure and Ecosystem Deficiencies: India lacks essential infrastructure components such as chipsets, semiconductor fabs, and a highly skilled engineering workforce. While India has launched initiatives in quantum computing and artificial intelligence, the foundational infrastructure necessary for high-impact innovation remains inadequate.

Inefficiencies in Utilization of Funds: In previous years, large-scale budgetary allocations for scientific research did not always translate into corresponding outcomes. Without a structured roadmap on how funds will be allocated and absorbed by research institutions and private enterprises, the full potential of these investments may not be realized.

Private Sector Engagement: The budget aims to encourage private enterprises to play a larger role in R&D, yet past trends indicate hesitation from industries to invest in long-term research. The government needs to introduce clearer incentives such as tax benefits, ease of patent registration, and public-private partnerships (PPP) to ensure sustained private sector participation.

The Way Forward

To transform India into a global research hub, the government must implement structural reforms alongside budgetary expansions:

Strengthening Core R&D Infrastructure: Establishing semiconductor manufacturing units, developing a skilled workforce, and investing in fundamental scientific research must be prioritized.

Encouraging Industry-Academia Collaboration: Universities should work closely with industries to create practical, market-driven innovations.

Transparent Allocation of Funds: Clear guidelines on how private players can access government funds will ensure higher participation and effective utilization.

Increased funding alone will not drive scientific progress unless these systemic bottlenecks are addressed. India must transition towards an ecosystem that nurtures long-term, sustainable innovation to emerge as a global leader in R&D.

### **Suggestions to Increase R&D Spending in India**  

India’s **R&D spending** is significantly low at **0.64% of GDP (2020)**, much lower than countries like **China (2.4%) and the USA (3.1%)**. To enhance investment in research and innovation, a **multi-pronged strategy** involving the government, private sector, and academia is necessary.

# From brain drain to brain gain

Introduction

The phenomenon of brain drain refers to the emigration of highly skilled professionals, scientists, engineers, and intellectuals from one country to another, often in search of better opportunities, higher salaries, and improved living standards. Developing countries, particularly India, have witnessed significant brain drain over the decades, with many talented individuals migrating to Western nations. However, in recent years, a shift towards brain gain has been observed, where skilled individuals return to their home countries, bringing with them expertise, investments, and global networks. This essay explores the transition from brain drain to brain gain, its causes, impacts, and possible strategies to harness this positive shift.

Causes of Brain Drain

Brain drain is often driven by several factors:

Economic Factors – Lower salaries, lack of funding, and fewer opportunities force professionals to seek better prospects abroad.

Educational Opportunities – Many students pursue higher education in foreign universities and often remain there for work due to better research facilities and employment prospects.

Political and Social Environment – Political instability, bureaucratic inefficiencies, and lack of merit-based opportunities contribute to the migration of talent.

Lack of Infrastructure – Inadequate research facilities, outdated technology, and limited funding for innovation push scientists and researchers to migrate to more advanced countries.

Better Standard of Living – Healthcare, quality of life, and social security in developed nations attract professionals from developing countries.

Impact of Brain Drain

Loss of Skilled Workforce – Developing countries lose their best minds, leading to stagnation in scientific and technological advancements.

Economic Setback – Countries investing in education and skill development fail to reap the benefits as professionals contribute to foreign economies instead.

Weakened Research and Development – A lack of researchers and professionals hampers innovation and industrial growth.

Social Inequality – The gap between developed and developing countries widens, as intellectual capital shifts to wealthier nations.

Shift Towards Brain Gain

Several factors have contributed to reversing the trend of brain drain, leading to brain gain:

Improved Economic Opportunities – Many developing nations, including India and China, have seen rapid economic growth, offering competitive salaries and career prospects.

Government Initiatives – Policies such as Make in India, Startup India, and R&D incentives encourage professionals to return and contribute.

Booming Startup Ecosystem – Growth in the IT, biotech, and healthcare industries has created attractive opportunities for entrepreneurs and skilled professionals.

Global Connectivity and Remote Work – The rise of digital connectivity allows professionals to contribute to their home countries while residing abroad.

National Pride and Social Commitment – Many individuals return with the intention of giving back to their homeland, contributing to its growth and development.

Benefits of Brain Gain

Economic Growth – Returning professionals bring foreign investments, contribute to the economy, and create job opportunities.

Knowledge and Technology Transfer – Exposure to global best practices and cutting-edge research enhances domestic innovation.

Boost to Education and Research – Experienced professionals contribute to academia, improving research output and mentoring young talent.

Stronger Global Networks – Overseas experience allows returning individuals to establish international collaborations and partnerships.

Entrepreneurial Growth – Many returning professionals become entrepreneurs, establishing startups that drive economic development.

Strategies to Sustain Brain Gain

To ensure sustained brain gain, countries need to adopt several proactive measures:

Enhancing Research and Development – Increased funding for R&D, improved infrastructure, and collaboration with international institutions.

Competitive Salaries and Benefits – Offering global-standard compensation and work environments to retain top talent.

Simplifying Bureaucratic Procedures – Reducing red tape to make it easier for professionals to return and contribute.

Encouraging Startups and Innovation – Providing financial support, mentorship, and incubation centers to foster entrepreneurship.

Conclusion

The shift from brain drain to brain gain marks a significant transformation for developing nations. While challenges remain, the increasing return of skilled professionals can accelerate economic growth, innovation, and national development. By fostering a conducive environment for intellectual capital, countries can turn the tide, ensuring that talent contributes to local progress rather than enriching foreign economies. With strategic policies and sustained efforts, brain gain can become a reality, transforming developing nations into global leaders in various fields.

The recent Open Doors Report 2024 revealed a telling trend: India has become the largest source of international students in the U.S.; with a record-breaking 3,31,602 students enrolled in 2023-24.

Indian students pursuing higher education abroad are making substantial financial contributions to international economies. In 2022, their direct spending — encompassing tuition fees, housing, and living expenses — was estimated at approximately $47 billion. This figure is projected to escalate to as much as $70 billion by 2025.

While this reflects the ambition and global outlook of India’s youth, it raises an important question: Why are so many of India’s brightest minds compelled to seek education abroad? India aspires to emerge as a global leader in education and innovation.

Yet, the student exodus underscores significant challenges in our higher education ecosystem. The answer lies in transforming India into a global study destination; not just for our own students but also for international learners. This transformation, however, requires a cohesive, multi-pronged strategy addressing education quality, financial sustainability, institutional autonomy, and capacity building.

Diversified financial model

The core challenge lies in India’s disproportionate reliance on tuition fees in privately funded institutions and government grants in public-funded ones as the primary sources of revenue. In globally renowned universities, tuition fees contribute only 15-20% of the total revenue.

In a stark contrast, Indian institutions often rely on tuition for over 80% of their funding. Similarly, government-funded institutions draw nearly 90% of their revenue from public funds. Both models are unsustainable and lack the scalability required to meet the growing demands of the education sector.

Ideally, tuition fees should contribute only 30-40% of total revenues. A sliding fee structure, coupled with merit-based scholarships funded by endowments, can help ensure access to quality education without compromising affordability.

Endowments, a mainstay of global universities, should form 30-35% of the revenue base. Encouraging philanthropy from alumni and corporate donors, supported by favourable tax policies and streamlined regulations, is essential to building these endowments.

Additionally, research overheads can contribute 20-25% of revenues through industry-academia collaborations and global research grants. By prioritising applied research that addresses real-world challenges, institutions can generate funding while making meaningful contributions to society. The remaining 10-15% of revenues can come from alternative sources such as executive education programmes, intellectual property commercialisation, and investments in start-ups.

This balanced approach reduces the financial burden on students while ensuring that institutions have the resources to invest in research, innovation, and global competitiveness.

Capacity and quality

Financial sustainability is only one piece of the puzzle. Scaling capacity and enhancing quality are equally critical. The government alone cannot meet the growing demand for higher education.

Public-private collaboration is central to this effort. Private institutions, supported by Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives, must play a greater role.

India needs to establish new world-class universities while upgrading existing ones with state-of-the-art infrastructure. A vibrant research and innovation ecosystem must be built by fostering industry-academia partnerships, increasing R and D funding, and creating mechanisms for monetising intellectual property. Flexible, interdisciplinary academic programmes aligned with global standards can further enhance the appeal of Indian institutions.

To improve the diversity and quality of education, Indian universities should actively recruit international faculty and forge global academic collaborations. Such measures would not only raise the global profile of Indian institutions but also expose students to a truly international learning environment.

Autonomy and accountability

An enabling policy environment is essential to drive these reforms. Institutional autonomy, as emphasised by the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, is a cornerstone of this transformation. Universities need the freedom to innovate in curriculum design, resource allocation, and partnerships with global institutions. Autonomy empowers institutions to respond dynamically to changing global and domestic needs, aligning strategies with global benchmarks.

Government policies must also encourage the creation and growth of endowments. Substantial tax benefits and flexibility in fund management can incentivise philanthropy. However, with autonomy must come accountability. Independent audits and professional fund management practices should be mandated to build stakeholder trust and ensure transparency.

Globally, universities are moving toward zero-tuition models sustained by endowments and research revenues. India, too, must aim for a future where quality education is universally accessible, rather than an aspirational privilege.

With these measures, India can reverse the brain drain and position itself as a global hub for education. The goal is not merely to retain Indian students but to attract learners from around the world. The time to act is now. By taking bold, transformative steps today, we can ensure that India’s brightest minds not only stay but thrive, and that global talent aspires to call India their alma mater.

> Brain drain refers to the emigration of skilled professionals seeking better opportunities abroad, often due to economic, educational, and infrastructural limitations in their home countries. This results in talent loss, economic setbacks, and weakened research sectors. However, a shift toward **brain gain** is emerging as professionals return home due to improved economic conditions, government incentives, and booming industries. Benefits include economic growth, knowledge transfer, and entrepreneurial expansion. To sustain brain gain, nations must enhance R&D, offer competitive salaries, strengthen education, and promote innovation. With strategic policies, countries can transform from talent exporters to global hubs of innovation and growth.

4. **Commercial Crops:** Cotton, Sugarcane, Copra, and Jute.  

#### **How MSP is Determined?**  
MSP is recommended by the **Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP)** based on factors like:  
1. **Cost of Production (A2 + FL formula)** – Covers input costs and family labor.  
2. **Market Price Trends** – Historical price movements of crops.  
3. **Demand-Supply Dynamics** – National and international demand for the crop.  
4. **Intercrop Price Parity** – Ensuring fair pricing among different crops.  
5. **Economic Factors** – Inflation, trade policies, and global prices.  

#### **Impact of MSP**  

##### **Positive Impacts**  
1. **Farmer Welfare:** Guarantees a minimum income, reducing farmer distress and suicides.  
2. **Food Security:** Encourages crop production, ensuring a stable food supply under **buffer stocks**.  
3. **Economic Growth:** Strengthens the rural economy by increasing farmer purchasing power.  
4. **Encourages Crop Diversification:** By setting different MSPs, the government promotes the production of pulses and oilseeds to reduce dependency on imports.  
5. **Inflation Control:** Stabilizes food prices in the market by preventing extreme price fluctuations.  

##### **Challenges and Criticism**  
1. **Limited Procurement:** Only wheat and rice are largely procured, leaving other crops vulnerable.  
2. **Middlemen Exploitation:** Farmers often do not receive the full MSP due to market inefficiencies.  
3. **Fiscal Burden:** High procurement leads to excess food stock, increasing storage costs for the government.  
4. **Environmental Concerns:** MSP incentivizes wheat and rice cultivation, leading to **water depletion and soil degradation** in states like Punjab and Haryana.  
5. **Market Distortion:** MSP can disrupt free-market pricing, affecting exports and private traders.  

#### **Way Forward**  
- **Expanding MSP Procurement**: More crops should be actively procured, especially pulses and oilseeds.  
- **Direct Benefit Transfers (DBT)**: Ensuring farmers receive payments directly to reduce middlemen exploitation.  
- **Crop Diversification**: Encouraging farmers to grow sustainable and high-value crops.  
- **Agri-Infrastructure Development**: Better storage and marketing facilities to support procurement.  

### **Conclusion**  
MSP is a **vital policy tool** to support farmers, ensure food security, and maintain price stability. While it has significantly benefited Indian agriculture, reforms are needed to make it more **inclusive, efficient, and environmentally sustainable**.

It thrives in tropical climates with moderate rainfall and is sown during the Kharif season. The government has set the **MSP for Red Gram at ₹7,000 per quintal**, with an additional **₹450 per quintal** incentive to support farmers. MSP ensures fair pricing and prevents distress sales. This initiative stabilizes farmer incomes, boosts pulse production, and maintains food security, benefiting both producers and consumers by ensuring a steady market supply.
