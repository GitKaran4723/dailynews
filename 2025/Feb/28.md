# A process where free and fair elections will be a casualty

### **The Chief Election Commissioner and Other Election Commissioners (Appointment, Conditions of Service and Term of Office) Bill, 2023**

The **Chief Election Commissioner and Other Election Commissioners (Appointment, Conditions of Service and Term of Office) Bill, 2023** is a significant legislation passed by the Indian Parliament. It marks the first statutory law enacted under **Article 324(5)** of the Constitution to regulate the **appointment, service conditions**, and **tenure** of the **Chief Election Commissioner (CEC)** and other **Election Commissioners (ECs)** of the **Election Commission of India (ECI)**.

This law emerged following debates around the **independence, transparency**, and **neutrality** of the Election Commission, especially concerning the process of appointments.

---

### **Background**

- The **Election Commission of India (ECI)** is a **constitutional body** established under **Article 324** to oversee **free and fair elections** in the country.
- Until this law, there was no parliamentary legislation detailing the exact process of appointing the **CEC** and **ECs**. Appointments were made solely by the **President of India** on the advice of the **Council of Ministers**, without a clear **collegium system**.
- In **March 2023**, the **Supreme Court** in the case of **Anoop Baranwal v. Union of India** mandated that a committee comprising the **Prime Minister**, **Leader of the Opposition (LoP)**, and the **Chief Justice of India (CJI)** would select the CEC and ECs until Parliament framed a law.
- Following this, the government introduced and passed the **2023 Bill** to formalize the appointment process.

---

### **Key Provisions of the Bill**

1. **Appointment Committee**:
   - Establishes a **Selection Committee** comprising:
     - **Prime Minister** (Chairperson)
     - **Leader of the Opposition** in the **Lok Sabha** (or leader of the largest opposition party)
     - **A Union Cabinet Minister** nominated by the Prime Minister
   - The **CJI** was **excluded** from the committee, which has been a point of criticism.

2. **Search Committee**:
   - Composed of senior bureaucrats to propose a panel of eligible candidates for consideration.

3. **Eligibility Criteria**:
   - Persons of integrity with expertise in law, governance, public administration, or related fields.

4. **Tenure**:
   - CEC and ECs shall hold office for **six years** or until **65 years of age**, whichever comes earlier.

5. **Conditions of Service**:
   - The salary and service conditions of the CEC and ECs are now aligned with that of a **Cabinet Secretary**, which critics argue could reduce their status and independence compared to previous parity with **Supreme Court judges**.

---

### **Significance of the Bill**

- **First legislative framework** to govern the Election Commission appointments.
- Aims to bring **clarity** and **procedural uniformity**.
- Attempts to balance **executive control** with limited involvement of the opposition via the **LoP**.

---

### **Criticism and Concerns**

- Exclusion of the **CJI** from the selection committee raised concerns over **judicial oversight** and **independence**.
- Potential for **executive dominance** over the Election Commission, which may affect **impartiality**.
- Downgrading the **status and pay** of commissioners could undermine the authority of the institution.
- Fears of weakening the **integrity** of elections if the appointment process lacks adequate checks and balances.

---

### **Conclusion**

The **2023 Bill** is a historic step in giving a **statutory backing** to the appointment of election commissioners, filling a constitutional gap left for Parliament to legislate. However, ensuring the **independence, neutrality**, and **credibility** of the Election Commission remains paramount for preserving **free and fair elections**, which are the cornerstone of **Indian democracy**. Future reforms and judicial scrutiny may continue to shape and refine this law to uphold the integrity of India’s electoral process.

# India’s Olive Ridley turtle numbers improve, but climate skews sex ratio

### **Olive Ridley Turtle: Conservation Status and Challenges**

The **Olive Ridley turtle** (*Lepidochelys olivacea*) is one of the smallest and most abundant species of **marine turtles** globally. Known for their unique mass nesting behavior called **“arribada”**, these turtles are primarily found in the **warm waters** of the **Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans**, including along **India’s eastern coast**. While recent reports indicate an improvement in **population numbers** in India, scientists are increasingly concerned about **climate change**, particularly its impact on **nesting beaches** and the **sex ratio** of hatchlings.

---

### **Distribution in India**
In India, Olive Ridley turtles are mainly found along the **coasts of Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu**. The most famous nesting sites are at:
- **Gahirmatha Beach** (Odisha)
- **Rushikulya River mouth** (Odisha)
- **Devi River mouth** (Odisha)

India hosts one of the world’s largest mass nesting events, attracting global attention for both its ecological significance and conservation challenges.

---

### **Significance of Olive Ridley Turtles**
- They play a crucial role in **maintaining healthy ocean ecosystems**, such as controlling jellyfish populations and contributing to nutrient cycling on beaches.
- Their eggs provide nutrients that enrich coastal vegetation, supporting dune stabilization.
- Olive Ridley turtles are listed as **Vulnerable** under the **IUCN Red List** and are protected under **Schedule I** of the **Indian Wildlife Protection Act, 1972**.

---

### **Threats to Olive Ridley Turtles**
| Threats                     | Impact                                       |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Fishing Nets (Bycatch)**  | Accidental entanglement leads to drowning. |
| **Coastal Development**     | Habitat destruction and disturbance.       |
| **Pollution**               | Ingestion of plastic and marine debris.    |
| **Climate Change**          | Rising temperatures affect sex determination and nesting sites. |
| **Poaching**                | Illegal harvesting of eggs and hunting.    |

---

### **Climate Change and Skewed Sex Ratios**
Olive Ridley turtles have **temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD)**, meaning the temperature of the sand where eggs incubate decides the sex of hatchlings:
- **Lower temperatures** (~26°C) produce **males**.
- **Higher temperatures** (~31°C) produce **females**.

Due to **rising global temperatures**, beaches are getting hotter, causing more **female hatchlings** and fewer males. Over time, this **skewed sex ratio** can threaten the **long-term survival** of the species by reducing breeding success.

---

### **Conservation Efforts in India**
- **Protection of nesting sites** through seasonal beach closures and monitoring.
- Use of **Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs)** in fishing nets to reduce bycatch.
- Community participation programs with local fishers and villagers.
- Awareness campaigns to minimize light pollution during nesting.
- Scientific monitoring of **sand temperatures** and **nest relocation** if needed.

---

### **Conclusion**
The recovery of Olive Ridley turtle numbers in India is a **positive conservation success**, reflecting sustained efforts by authorities, scientists, and coastal communities. However, **climate change-induced challenges**, especially **altered sex ratios**, threaten the species' future. A combination of **adaptive management**, stronger **climate action**, and continued **community engagement** is essential to protect these ancient mariners and maintain **India’s coastal biodiversity**.

> The **Olive Ridley turtle**, found along India’s **east coast**, is known for its mass nesting (**arribada**) at sites like **Gahirmatha** and **Rushikulya**. While conservation efforts have improved their population, **climate change** poses new threats. Rising sand temperatures impact their **temperature-dependent sex determination**, causing a **female-biased sex ratio**, which may harm future breeding. Other threats include **fishing net entanglements**, **habitat loss**, and **pollution**. Conservation measures like protecting nesting beaches, using **Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs)**, and involving local communities are vital. Long-term survival depends on tackling **climate change** and safeguarding **India’s coastal ecosystems**.
