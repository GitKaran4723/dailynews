# Navigation satellite launched last week suffers malfunction

On January 29, 2025, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) launched the NVS-02 navigation satellite aboard the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV-F15) from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota. This mission marked ISRO's 100th launch from the site. 

NVS-02 is the second satellite in the NVS series, designed to enhance India's Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC) system. Equipped with navigation payloads in L1, L5, and S bands, as well as a ranging payload in C-band, the satellite was intended to replace the IRNSS-1E satellite at the 111.75° East orbital slot. 

Following a successful launch, the satellite was deployed into a geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) with a perigee of 165 km and an apogee of 36,577 km. However, during the orbit-raising maneuvers, a technical malfunction occurred: the valves responsible for admitting the oxidizer to fire the thrusters did not open. This failure prevented the satellite from reaching its designated geostationary orbit. 

ISRO reported that despite this issue, the satellite's systems remain healthy, and it continues to operate in an elliptical orbit. The organization is exploring alternative mission strategies to utilize the satellite for navigation purposes within its current orbit. 

The NVS-02 satellite was designed to provide Standard Positioning Service (SPS) and Restricted Service (RS), offering position accuracy better than 20 meters and timing accuracy better than 40 nanoseconds over its primary service area. The mission's setback underscores the challenges inherent in space missions and highlights the importance of robust contingency planning. 

As ISRO investigates the root cause of the malfunction, the focus remains on salvaging the mission's objectives and ensuring the continued advancement of India's indigenous navigation capabilities.

# On live-in relationships in Uttarakhand

In February 2024, Uttarakhand became the first Indian state to enact a Uniform Civil Code (UCC), introducing standardized personal laws governing marriage, divorce, inheritance, and live-in relationships, applicable to all residents except members of Scheduled Tribes. 

Mandatory Registration of Live-In Relationships

A significant aspect of Uttarakhand's UCC is the compulsory registration of live-in relationships. Couples are required to register their live-in arrangements within one month of entering into such a relationship. Failure to comply can result in penalties, including imprisonment of up to six months or fines up to ₹25,000. 

Legal Recognition and Rights

By mandating registration, the UCC aims to provide legal recognition to live-in relationships, thereby extending certain protections and rights to partners. This includes ensuring maintenance rights for deserted partners and legitimizing children born from such unions, granting them inheritance and maintenance rights. 

Responsibilities of Landlords and House Owners

The code also places obligations on landlords and property owners. If they knowingly rent properties to couples in live-in relationships without informing authorities, they may face legal action. 

Public and Legal Reactions

The introduction of mandatory registration has sparked debates. Proponents argue that it offers legal protection and social security to individuals in live-in relationships. Critics, however, view it as an infringement on personal freedoms and privacy, expressing concerns over potential misuse and the state's role in personal relationships. 

Judicial Perspective

Prior to the UCC's implementation, the Uttarakhand High Court recognized the rights of individuals in live-in relationships. In the 2021 case of Rohit Sagar v. State of Uttarakhand, the court upheld that adults have the fundamental right to choose their life partners, emphasizing protection for same-sex couples facing familial opposition. 

Conclusion

Uttarakhand's UCC represents a pioneering move towards uniform personal laws in India. The mandatory registration of live-in relationships seeks to provide legal clarity and protection. However, it also raises important discussions about individual autonomy, privacy, and the extent of state intervention in personal affairs.

# A Budget that is forward-looking and growth-oriented

The Union Budget 2025-26 is in line with the government’s sustained efforts over the past few years to bolster economic growth and development. The provisions of the Budget indicate the continuation of the government’s strategic approach toward economic expansion, fiscal prudence, and sectoral growth.

### The multiplier effects of the IT cuts

One of announcements in the Budget that has been most widely welcomed is the significant cut in personal income-tax, with complete exemption extended to individuals earning up to ₹12 lakh per year. This limit will be ₹12.75 lakh for salaried tax-payers because of the standard deduction of ₹75,000. This is a major relief for the middle class, and is expected to have a multiplier effect on the economy.

Higher disposable income can trigger a virtuous cycle of higher consumption, increased demand, and improved business performance. This, in turn, will result in higher indirect tax collections and further economic expansion. Specifically, greater consumer spending will benefit industries such as retail, real estate, and automobile manufacturing, boosting employment opportunities.

Another key highlight of the Budget is the allocation of ₹11.2 lakh crore for capital expenditure for 2025-26, marking an increase of nearly 10% from the actual expenditure in the current fiscal year. This enhanced spending can drive infrastructure development, boost employment generation, and catalyse economic activity across sectors. And, of course, it strengthens the nation’s logistical and industrial backbone, ensuring long-term sustainable growth.

In a major thrust to manufacturing, the Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, has also announced the establishment of a National Manufacturing Mission. The aim is to promote the ‘Make in India’ initiative by covering small, medium, and large industries, providing policy support, execution road maps, and governance frameworks in collaboration with central Ministries and States. The mission is expected to enhance domestic capabilities, reduce import dependency, and encourage foreign investment. While the finer details are yet to be examined, it appears to be a well-conceived initiative. By streamlining regulatory processes, offering incentives, and creating an enabling business environment, this initiative has the potential to position India as a global manufacturing hub.

### Focus on labour-intensive sectors

In consonance with the government’s commitment to job creation, the Budget is focused on labour-intensive sectors such as tourism, food processing and leather. These industries have historically been major employment generators and contribute substantially to India’s export earnings. By providing targeted incentives and streamlining regulations, the Budget aims to enhance productivity, improve competitiveness, and create new job opportunities in these sectors.

On the infrastructure side, we see the Budget focus on the maritime sector through the announcement of a new Maritime Development Fund. This will give a boost to the marine economy, especially in the coastal States of the country, creating growth opportunities for both trade and the blue economy-related segments. The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) has also noted with interest the plan for flight connectivity to 120 new destinations under a modified Ude Desh ka Aam Naagrik (UDAN) scheme as this too will enable new economic opportunities in newly connected regions of the country as emerging growth centres.

The Budget has introduced the Prime Minister Dhan-Dhaanya Krishi Yojana, a targeted initiative designed to enhance agricultural productivity and improve rural livelihoods. The programme will cover 100 districts with low productivity, moderate crop intensity, and below-average credit access, in partnership with State governments.

This initiative aims to promote crop diversification and sustainable agricultural practices, enhance post-harvest storage infrastructure, improve irrigation facilities, and facilitate access to credit. With an estimated 1.7 crore farmer-beneficiaries, this has the potential to transform the agricultural landscape, increase rural incomes, and drive economic activity in India’s hinterlands. Higher rural purchasing power will indirectly benefit the corporate sector, particularly those involved in consumer goods and agricultural supply chains.

Another commendable aspect of the Budget is the government’s resolve to reduce the fiscal deficit from 4.8% in 2024-25 to 4.4% in 2025-26. This move is critical as sound public finance management is a sine qua non for sustained economic growth. A lower fiscal deficit will help stabilise inflation, increase investor confidence, and create a more robust macroeconomic environment.

### A boost to ease of doing business

Rationalisation of the duty structure and simplification of the tariff framework by removing an additional seven tariff rates is a noteworthy announcement. While this may sound simple, it is a major step towards simplification and enhancing ease of doing business for industry. The rationalisation of cess by ensuring that no more than one cess or surcharge would be levied is a crucial step toward ensuring a fairer and more predictable taxation regime, benefiting both industry and consumers. The Budget has also addressed the issue of inverted duty structure for some products, which is a welcome step. This would enhance trade competitiveness and encourage greater participation of domestic firms in global supply chains.

The continued focus on capital expenditure, manufacturing, and labour-intensive sectors, combined with fiscal prudence and income-tax relief, sets the stage for robust growth in the years ahead.

While the finer details of various schemes and policies will need closer examination, the overarching framework of the Budget suggests a proactive, forward-looking, and growth-oriented strategy. As businesses and stakeholders begin to analyse and adapt to the new measures, the true impact of Budget 2025-26 will unfold in the next few months.

> A **forward-looking and growth-oriented budget** focuses on **economic expansion, innovation, and sustainability** while addressing future challenges. It prioritizes **infrastructure development, digital transformation, skill enhancement, and job creation**. Such a budget includes **higher capital expenditure, tax reforms, fiscal discipline, and incentives for industries** to drive investment. It also emphasizes **social welfare, green energy, and financial inclusion** to ensure equitable growth. By fostering **technological advancements, ease of doing business, and global competitiveness**, this budget aims to accelerate **long-term economic resilience and stability**, ensuring sustainable development while balancing fiscal responsibility.

# State’s draft law plans to ask people not to repay money taken from unlicensed MFIs

The Karnataka government has recently drafted the Karnataka Microfinance (Prevention of Coercive Actions) Ordinance, 2025, aiming to protect borrowers from aggressive recovery practices employed by certain microfinance institutions (MFIs) and unlicensed moneylenders. This legislative move is a response to a series of distressing incidents, including borrower suicides attributed to coercive loan recovery methods and exorbitant interest rates. 


Key Provisions of the Ordinance:

Loan Waivers for Unlicensed Lending: Borrowers who have taken loans from unlicensed and unregistered MFIs will have their debts, including any accrued interest, deemed fully discharged. This means they are legally absolved from repaying such loans. Furthermore, civil courts are prohibited from entertaining any suits or proceedings against these borrowers for loan recovery, and all pending suits are to be dismissed. 


Mandatory Registration of MFIs: All MFIs operating in Karnataka are required to register with the district registering authority within 30 days of the ordinance's enactment. The registration process necessitates the submission of detailed information, including operational areas, interest rates charged, loan recovery methods, and comprehensive records of borrowers and their loan statuses. Registrations are valid for one year, with renewals to be sought 60 days prior to expiration. Authorities hold the power to cancel registrations if complaints are filed against an MFI. 


Prohibition of Coercive Recovery Practices: The ordinance explicitly bans MFIs from employing coercive actions, either directly or through agents, for loan recovery. Prohibited practices include:

Applying pressure, obstructing, or using violence against borrowers or their family members.
Persistently following or intimidating borrowers or their families.
Interfering with or depriving borrowers of their property.
Frequenting the residence or workplace of borrowers to exert pressure.
Employing external agencies to coerce borrowers into repayment.
Forcibly taking documents that entitle borrowers to government benefits.
Violations of these provisions are punishable with imprisonment ranging from six months to ten years and fines up to ₹5 lakh. Offenses under this ordinance are classified as cognizable and non-bailable. 


Regulation of Loan Terms and Transparency: MFIs are prohibited from demanding security deposits, such as pledged assets or valuables, from borrowers. All loan agreements must be transparent, with no hidden fees. MFIs are required to maintain a physical office in the local area of operation and ensure all communications are in Kannada. Additionally, they must issue loan cards to borrowers detailing repayment schedules, interest rates, and borrower obligations. Interest rates must be publicly displayed at all MFI offices. 


Enforcement and Dispute Resolution: Borrowers experiencing harassment can file complaints at local police stations, where officers are mandated to register cases. A police officer not below the rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police (DySP) is authorized to initiate cases against MFIs engaging in unlawful practices. The ordinance also proposes the appointment of an ombudsperson to mediate disputes between lenders and borrowers. 

Rationale Behind the Ordinance:

The microfinance sector in Karnataka has witnessed significant growth, with MFIs holding a total loan portfolio of ₹42,265 crore in the 2023-24 fiscal year. The average loan per client stands at ₹44,036. However, this growth has been accompanied by reports of aggressive lending practices, violation of Reserve Bank of India guidelines, and coercive recovery methods, leading to severe distress among borrowers. The ordinance seeks to address these issues by instituting stringent regulations and providing legal protections to vulnerable borrowers. 


Conclusion:

The Karnataka Microfinance (Prevention of Coercive Actions) Ordinance, 2025, represents a comprehensive effort by the state government to regulate the microfinance sector, protect borrowers from predatory practices, and ensure ethical lending and recovery processes. By enforcing strict penalties and mandating transparency, the ordinance aims to create a more equitable financial environment for economically vulnerable groups in Karnataka.
