# ‘Over 800 apps, 3,266 websites blocked due to security reasons’

The Indian government's recent action to block over 800 apps and 3,266 websites citing security concerns underscores the nation's commitment to safeguarding its digital sovereignty. This measure, while aimed at protecting national interests, brings to the forefront the legal frameworks governing such actions and the ensuing debate on their implications.

**Legal Framework for Blocking Digital Content in India**

In India, the authority to block access to online content is primarily derived from Section 69A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act). This section empowers the Central Government or its authorized officers to direct the blocking of public access to any information through any computer resource when it is deemed necessary for:

- Sovereignty and integrity of India
- Defense of India
- Security of the State
- Friendly relations with foreign states
- Public order
- Preventing incitement to the commission of any cognizable offense related to the above

The procedural framework for implementing Section 69A is outlined in the Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Blocking for Access of Information by Public) Rules, 2009, commonly referred to as the "Blocking Rules." These rules mandate that a designated officer, not below the rank of a Joint Secretary, must issue the blocking order after following due process, which includes:

1. **Examination of Request:** A request for blocking can be made by any individual or agency. The designated officer examines the request to determine its validity under the specified grounds.

2. **Committee Review:** A committee comprising representatives from various ministries reviews the request. The content creator or intermediary is given an opportunity to present their case, ensuring a fair hearing.

3. **Recommendation:** Based on the review, the committee makes a recommendation to the designated officer.

4. **Issuance of Order:** If the recommendation favors blocking, the designated officer issues a reasoned order directing the concerned agency or intermediary to block the content.

In emergency situations, where delays could be detrimental, the Blocking Rules provide for an interim blocking order to be issued without affording an opportunity of hearing to the content creator or intermediary. However, such an order must be confirmed by the committee within 48 hours after following the due process.

**Pros of Blocking Apps and Websites**

1. **National Security:** Blocking apps and websites that pose security threats helps prevent espionage, data breaches, and cyber-attacks, thereby safeguarding national interests.

2. **Protection of Citizens' Data:** By restricting access to platforms that mishandle or expose personal data, the government can prevent misuse of sensitive information, as seen in instances where websites exposing Aadhaar and PAN details were blocked. citeturn0search3

3. **Maintaining Public Order:** Curbing access to content that incites violence, hate speech, or communal disharmony helps maintain societal harmony and public order.

4. **Preservation of Cultural Values:** Blocking content that is obscene or detrimental to cultural norms can help preserve societal values and protect vulnerable groups from harmful material.

**Cons of Blocking Apps and Websites**

1. **Freedom of Expression:** Excessive or unwarranted blocking can infringe upon the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression, leading to censorship and suppression of dissent.

2. **Lack of Transparency:** The blocking process, especially under Rule 16 of the Blocking Rules, is often opaque, with orders kept confidential, making it difficult to assess the justification and proportionality of such actions. citeturn0search7

3. **Economic Impact:** Blocking popular apps and websites can adversely affect businesses and individuals who rely on these platforms for commerce, communication, and information dissemination.

4. **Technological Challenges:** Users may resort to circumventing blocks using virtual private networks (VPNs) or other means, rendering the blocking measures ineffective and potentially exposing users to unregulated content.

5. **Potential for Abuse:** The broad grounds under Section 69A can be misused to suppress political dissent or target specific groups, leading to violations of civil liberties.

**Conclusion**

While the legal provisions under the IT Act and the Blocking Rules provide a framework for restricting access to harmful online content, it is imperative to balance national security and public order with the fundamental rights of citizens. Ensuring transparency, accountability, and adherence to due process in the blocking mechanism is crucial to prevent abuse and maintain public trust. Regular audits, judicial oversight, and clear guidelines can help in achieving this balance, ensuring that the digital space remains open, safe, and secure for all users.

> India recently blocked over **800 apps and 3,266 websites** citing security concerns under **Section 69A of the IT Act, 2000**. This law allows the government to restrict content to protect **national security, public order, and data privacy**. While blocking prevents **cyber threats, misinformation, and data breaches**, concerns arise over **freedom of speech, lack of transparency, and economic impact**. The opaque process can lead to misuse, censorship, and disruption for businesses.

# Manipur crisis drags on as BJP weighs options

The northeastern state of Manipur has been embroiled in ethnic violence since May 2023, primarily between the majority Meitei and minority Kuki communities. The conflict has resulted in over 250 deaths and displaced approximately 60,000 individuals. Tensions escalated due to disputes over economic benefits, job quotas, and the Meitei community's demand for Scheduled Tribe status, which the Kuki community opposes. The situation was further aggravated by an influx of refugees from Myanmar following its 2021 military coup, leading to demographic concerns and increased competition for resources. 

In response to the ongoing unrest and mounting pressure from both opposition parties and allies within his own party, Chief Minister N. Biren Singh resigned on February 9, 2025. His resignation came ahead of a scheduled legislative assembly session where a no-confidence motion was anticipated. Following his departure, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been deliberating on potential successors. However, internal disagreements and the absence of a consensus candidate have led to discussions about imposing President's Rule as a possible solution to restore stability in the state. 

**President's Rule in India**

President's Rule refers to the suspension of a state's legislative assembly and the imposition of direct governance by the central government through the state's Governor. This measure is invoked under Article 356 of the Indian Constitution when a state government is unable to function according to constitutional provisions.

**Grounds for Imposition**

President's Rule can be imposed under several circumstances:

- **Failure to Elect a Leader:** If the state assembly is unable to elect a leader as Chief Minister within a prescribed time.

- **Loss of Majority:** If a coalition breaks down, leading to the Chief Minister losing majority support in the assembly, and failing to prove otherwise within a stipulated time.

- **No-Confidence Motion:** If the government loses a vote of no-confidence in the assembly.

- **Postponement of Elections:** If elections are postponed due to unavoidable reasons like war, epidemic, or natural disasters.

- **Governor's Report:** If the Governor reports that the state's constitutional machinery has failed.

**Procedure for Imposition**

1. **Governor's Report:** The state's Governor sends a report to the President indicating the failure of constitutional machinery in the state.

2. **Presidential Proclamation:** Based on the Governor's report or otherwise, the President can issue a proclamation under Article 356, taking over the state's executive functions.

3. **Parliamentary Approval:** The proclamation must be approved by both Houses of Parliament within two months. If approved, President's Rule can continue for six months and can be extended for a maximum of three years with parliamentary approval every six months. Extensions beyond one year require the fulfillment of specific conditions, such as the existence of a national emergency in the country or in the whole or any part of the state, and the Election Commission certifying that elections cannot be conducted in the state.

**Effects of President's Rule**

- **Dissolution or Suspension of State Assembly:** The state legislative assembly is either dissolved or kept in suspended animation.

- **Executive Authority:** The state's executive authority is exercised by the Governor on behalf of the President.

- **Parliament's Legislative Power:** Parliament assumes the power to legislate for the state.

**Judicial Safeguards**

The imposition of President's Rule is subject to judicial review. The Supreme Court, in the landmark S.R. Bommai v. Union of India case (1994), ruled that the President's proclamation under Article 356 is not absolute and can be challenged in court. The Court held that such a proclamation is subject to judicial review to examine whether it was based on relevant material and whether the constitutional machinery had indeed broken down. This judgment aimed to prevent the misuse of Article 356 for political purposes and to uphold the federal structure of the Constitution.

**Criticism and Misuse**

Article 356 has been criticized for its potential misuse, particularly when the central government dismisses state governments led by opposition parties. Such actions are viewed as undermining the federal structure of the nation. The S.R. Bommai judgment sought to curb this misuse by establishing strict guidelines for the imposition of President's Rule.

In the context of Manipur, the imposition of President's Rule is being considered due to the ongoing ethnic violence and the political instability following the Chief Minister's resignation. This measure is seen as a means to restore order and ensure governance in the state until a stable government can be formed.

> Manipur has been experiencing ethnic violence since May 2023, primarily between the Meitei and Kuki communities, resulting in over 250 deaths and 60,000 displaced people. The crisis worsened due to political instability, leading to Chief Minister N. Biren Singh’s resignation on February 9, 2025. The BJP is considering imposing President's Rule as no consensus candidate has emerged. President’s Rule, under Article 356, allows the central government to take control of a state when constitutional governance fails. Though it ensures stability, its misuse has been criticized. Judicial safeguards, like the S.R. Bommai case, ensure its application remains fair and justified.
