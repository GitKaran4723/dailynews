# Challenges of malaria vaccination, as elimination becomes achievable

The WHO’s recent declaration of Georgia as the 45th country to eliminate malaria is a significant milestone. Yet, even as we celebrate this achievement, a lingering question remains: if smallpox has been eradicated, why does malaria persist, and why is its vaccine far less effective than those for viral diseases? Despite decades of global efforts, malaria still causes over 240 million cases and more than 600,000 deaths annually.

The discovery of malaria’s transmission was a fragmented journey, like a non-linear movie where different revelations come together to complete the puzzle at the end. Malaria was believed to be caused by miasma or foul air from swamps. This misconception persisted until Alphonse Laveran, a military doctor, identified the Plasmodium parasite in 1880, proving malaria was caused by a living organism. However, the question of how the parasite entered humans remained unanswered. In 1891, Patrick Manson hypothesised that mosquitoes played a role in transmission, though he lacked experimental proof.

Giovanni Grassi later confirmed that only female Anopheles mosquitoes carried the parasite, but the full cycle was still unclear. The final breakthrough came in 1897 when Ronald Ross in India demonstrated that Plasmodium completed its life cycle in mosquitoes, proving they were malaria’s vectors. This scientific triumph had far-reaching consequences, allowing European colonial powers to survive in tropical Africa, where malaria had previously limited their expansion. In 1870, only 10% of Africa was under European control, but by 1914, nearly 90% of the continent had been colonised. Ironically, instead of liberating the populations most affected by malaria, the discovery of its transmission pathway paved the way for their subjugation, reinforcing colonial rule rather than dismantling it. Progress in science does not always translate to moral or equitable outcomes.

### Understanding parasites

Knowing the parasite’s life cycle is essential to understand the difficulty in developing vaccines. The cycle begins when an infected Anopheles mosquito bites a human, injecting Plasmodium sporozoites that are highly infective, into the bloodstream. These parasites first travel to the liver, invading liver cells and multiplying undetected by the immune system. After this phase, they re-enter the bloodstream, infecting red blood cells and causing malaria’s characteristic fever and chills. As the parasite multiplies asexually within RBCs, some develop into sexual forms known as gametocytes, which are then taken up by another mosquito when it bites an infected individual. Inside the mosquito, these gametocytes undergo sexual reproduction, maturing into sporozoites that migrate to the mosquito’s salivary glands, making the mosquito infectious to new human hosts.

Viruses are simpler in comparison, consisting of only genetic material (DNA or RNA) encased in a protein shell, and are relatively straightforward compared to parasites. Plasmodium is a protozoan parasite and eukaryotic organism with multiple stages of development, each featuring different surface antigens. Plasmodium species that infect humans — P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae, and P. knowlesi have unique characteristics, adding to the challenge of vaccine development.

The malaria parasite masters deception, outmanoeuvring the human immune system. Its greatest strength is antigenic variation, where it frequently changes its surface proteins, making it difficult for immune cells to recognise it and respond. Plasmodium follows an intracellular lifestyle, hiding within the liver and RBCs, shielding itself from immune surveillance. This ability to evade detection weakens the body’s ability to develop long-lasting immunity, making reinfection common. Adding to the challenge, malaria’s life cycle spans multiple stages across two hosts—humans and mosquitoes—requiring any potential vaccine to target several phases simultaneously. So when a vaccine is developed, the parasite’s genetic adaptability enables it to evolve resistance. Fighting malaria is like trying to corner a cunning politician who changes allegiance and ideology, senses the public sentiment, and always stays ahead of the game to remain in power. Plasmodium has been perfecting this trick for 30 million years, adapting and evolving to ensure its survival. When scientists find a way to combat one strain, the parasite shifts tactics, altering its proteins and genetic structure to bypass immunity. The adaptability makes it difficult to develop a universal and long-lasting vaccine.

### Malaria vaccines

The RTS, S malaria vaccine became the first to receive WHO approval for large-scale rollout in endemic regions after 60 years of research. It targets the liver stage of the parasite’s life cycle by inducing an immune response against the circum-sporozoite protein (CSP) found on Plasmodium sporozoites. This stage infects the liver after a mosquito bite. However, its efficacy is limited, reducing malaria cases by approximately 36% after four doses over four years in children. It is significantly lower than the 90-95% efficacy in vaccines for diseases like measles. Protection is also inconsistent, varying across age groups and transmission settings, and its effectiveness declines over time. RTS, S requires multiple doses, posing logistical challenges ensuring widespread distribution and coverage in resource-limited regions.

Researchers are now developing second-generation malaria vaccines. One promising candidate is the R21/Matrix-M vaccine, which enhances the immune response with a stronger adjuvant and has shown 77% efficacy over 12 months. The PfSPZ vaccine, a whole-parasite vaccine, attenuates sporozoites to stimulate immunity against the liver stage of infection. RH5-based vaccines prevent Plasmodium from invading red blood cells and target the blood stage after symptoms. Meanwhile, transmission-blocking vaccines aim to halt the spread of malaria by preventing mosquitoes from becoming carriers, targeting proteins like Pfs25 and Pfs230, essential for parasite development within the mosquito.

### Research underfunded

Malaria vaccine research has long suffered from underfunding . Since malaria primarily affects low-income countries in Africa and parts of South Asia, funding for research and healthcare infrastructure has remained limited. The availability of treatments for malaria has reduced the immediate urgency for vaccine development. Compounding this, the complexity of the parasite itself has discouraged pharmaceutical companies from investing in malaria vaccines, as the cost of research is high, and potential returns on investment remain uncertain. Countries are now facing a resurgence of the disease due to shifting mosquito habitats. An effective malaria control strategy will require a combination of more efficient vaccines, mosquito control & improved treatment options. The road to a malaria-free world is long, but it is an achievable goal.

> Malaria vaccination faces several challenges despite **elimination becoming achievable**. The **efficacy of existing vaccines**, like **RTS,S/AS01 (Mosquirix) and R21/Matrix-M**, remains **moderate**, requiring multiple doses and booster shots. **Limited production capacity and high costs** hinder widespread distribution, especially in **low-income, high-burden regions**. **Vaccine logistics**, including storage and delivery, pose difficulties in remote areas. **Parasite mutation and drug resistance** reduce long-term effectiveness. **Public awareness and vaccine hesitancy** impact uptake. Integration with **existing malaria control measures** (insecticide-treated nets, drugs) remains critical. Addressing these **scientific, logistical, and financial** challenges is key to achieving **global malaria elimination** goals.

# China’s dam project opens the floodgates of concern

The planned construction by China, of a massive hydroelectric dam on the lower section of the upper stream of the Yarlung Zangbo river in Tibet, has become a matter of concern for India due to its potential impact on the local environment and spillover, the flow of water downstream, and bilateral relations. Originating in Tibet, the Yarlung Zangbo is called the Brahmaputra after it reaches the Indian State of Assam where it meets its important tributaries. In India’s Arunachal Pradesh, it is called the Siang.

The Brahmaputra is a part of the everyday life of millions of people from India’s northeastern States and Bangladesh. China’s decision to plan a dam on the Yarlung Zangbo is a part of its broader strategy to transition from coal to renewable energy sources, particularly hydroelectric power. As outlined in its 14th Five-Year Plan (2021–2025), China aims to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. While this transition is commendable, the reliance on large-scale hydroelectric projects raises significant concerns. While the dam project aligns with China’s ambitious energy transition goals, its serious implications for India cannot be understated.

### The legal dimensions

The construction of the dam raises critical legal issues under international water law. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses (UN Watercourses Convention) 1997 emphasises the principles of equitable and reasonable utilisation, the obligation to prevent significant harm, and the duty to cooperate. These principles are essential in ensuring that shared water resources are managed sustainably and equitably.

However, China and India are not signatories to the UN Watercourses Convention. Nor do they adhere to a robust framework of domestic laws governing transboundary rivers. The official documents on water published by the Chinese government maintain that Beijing is a benevolent upper riparian that follows: first, the principle of international cooperation; second, the principle of people orientation; third, the principle of sharing rights and obligations, and fourth, the principle of equal emphasis on development and protection.

However, many of China’s lower riparian states accuse it for using water as a ‘ powerful tool’. India, which is one of the lower riparian states, depends on rivers that originate in Tibet for one-third of its river water supply. Due to the increasing securitisation of water and the rise of assertive military nationalism, a number of Indian political analysts say that China poses a serious water threat to India, making it vulnerable to unilateral actions. India has regularly expressed its concerns about the projects on the transboundary rivers. The memoranda of understanding between India and China on the sharing of water data about the Sutlej and Brahmaputra rivers have expired now. With ties improving between the two countries, there is a possibility that the MoUs could also be renewed. There is an expert level mechanism (ELM) to deal with water-related matters that meets regularly. In the absence of a concrete agreement, the ELM’s role in managing water-related matters between India and China is significant.

### Significant environmental concerns

The proposed dam is being constructed in one of the world’s most seismically active regions. The risk of earthquakes poses a significant threat to the stability of the structure, with the possibility of catastrophic consequences for both upstream and downstream areas. For instance, the earthquake in Tibet in January 2025 led to the death of more than 120 people while over 150 were injured. Additionally, the construction of such a massive dam disrupts river ecosystems, alters sediment flow, and threatens biodiversity in the river basin region. The potential environmental damage extends to the loss of habitats for aquatic and terrestrial species and increased riverbank erosion. Such a dam would also have an impact on Bangladesh which the Brahmaputra enters from India. However, Bangladesh has not expressed any serious concerns over the hydroproject. The main reason is the growing divide between Dhaka and New Delhi ever since the fall of the Sheikh Hasina government in August 2024 and the level of ties Bangladesh has with China.

### A ‘water alliance’ and hurdles

But this is an issue that will not just affect Bangladesh. Water-related activities in Tibet will affect the other lower riparian South Asian states such as Nepal, Bhutan and Pakistan. To deal with the situation, it is better to have a water negotiation plan for the region.

However, given the political situation in South Asia, it is tough to imagine a water alliance between the countries receiving water from Tibet. An absence of an active regional organisation halts South Asia from developing a collective strategy to manage transboundary rivers and conduct negotiations with the upper riparian country. Bilateral ties between India and many of its neighbouring countries are not in good shape and see fluctuations frequently.

The water issue between India and China cannot be de-linked from their day-to-day political relations because of the influence of politics on water-related decisions.

The recent India-China diplomatic engagements raise hopes for renewing lapsed MoUs and improving trust through information-sharing on Tibet-origin rivers.

China has reiterated that the dam on the Yarlung Zangbo will not affect water flow to India. However, New Delhi has expressed its concerns. To clear any doubts or concerns that the lower riparian states might have, the ELM would be a better platform.
