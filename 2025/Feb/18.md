# Delhi rocked by second strongest earthquake in three decades

On **February 17, 2025**, at **5:36 am**, Delhi and its surrounding regions experienced a significant seismic event. The earthquake, registering a magnitude of **4.0**, was notable for its shallow depth of **5 kilometers**, which intensified its perceptibility across the National Capital Region (NCR). This tremor stands out as the **second strongest** in Delhi over the past three decades, a period during which the region has recorded **446 earthquakes** within a 50-kilometer radius. citeturn0search5

**Immediate Impact and Public Response**

The early morning quake prompted many residents to evacuate their homes in alarm. In areas like Noida, individuals recounted buildings shaking, leading families to seek safety outdoors. Notably, at **Jheel Park** near **Dhaula Kuan**, identified as the earthquake's epicenter, a **20-25-year-old tree was uprooted**, underscoring the tremor's localized impact. citeturn0search0

**Scientific Analysis**

Experts from the **National Center for Seismology (NCS)** attributed the earthquake to natural variations in the region's geological features, specifically citing **"in-situ material heterogeneity"** rather than movements of tectonic plates. Delhi's unique geological setting, influenced by the ancient **Aravalli-Delhi Fold Belt**, makes it susceptible to such seismic activities. citeturn0search0

**Understanding Earthquakes**

An **earthquake** is the shaking of the Earth's surface resulting from a sudden release of energy in the lithosphere that creates seismic waves. These events can range from minor tremors to significant ground movements capable of causing widespread destruction. citeturn0search6

**Causes of Earthquakes**

The primary cause of earthquakes is the movement of tectonic plates. The Earth's crust is divided into several plates that float atop the semi-fluid mantle. The interactions at plate boundaries—be it colliding, sliding past, or moving away from each other—lead to stress accumulation. When this stress exceeds the frictional force holding the plates in place, it results in a sudden release of energy, manifesting as an earthquake. 

**Effects of Earthquakes**

Earthquakes can have profound impacts, including:

- **Ground Shaking**: The most immediate effect, leading to structural damage or collapse.

- **Surface Rupture**: Visible displacement on the Earth's surface along the fault line.

- **Secondary Effects**: Such as landslides, tsunamis, fires from ruptured gas lines, and soil liquefaction. 

**Safety Measures and Preparedness**

Given the unpredictability of earthquakes, preparedness is crucial:

- **Before an Earthquake**: Secure heavy items, develop an emergency plan, and conduct regular drills.

- **During an Earthquake**: Drop to hands and knees, cover the head and neck, and hold on until the shaking stops.

- **After an Earthquake**: Check for injuries, inspect for hazards like gas leaks, and stay informed through official channels.

**Delhi's Seismic Profile**

Delhi's seismic activity is influenced by its proximity to the Himalayan seismic belt and local fault lines. The region's historical data indicates a pattern of low to moderate intensity earthquakes, necessitating continuous monitoring and adherence to building codes designed for seismic resilience. 

**Conclusion**

The February 17, 2025, earthquake serves as a reminder of Delhi's inherent seismic risks. While the city has not experienced catastrophic earthquakes in recent history, the frequency of tremors underscores the importance of preparedness, public awareness, and infrastructure designed to withstand seismic events.

> On **February 17, 2025**, Delhi experienced a **4.0 magnitude earthquake**, marking its **second strongest in three decades**. The **epicenter was near Dhaula Kuan**, with tremors felt across NCR, causing public panic and minor damage. Experts attribute it to **local geological shifts** rather than tectonic plate movements. Earthquakes occur due to **stress release in the Earth’s crust**, leading to **ground shaking, structural damage, and secondary effects** like landslides. Delhi, situated in a **seismically active zone**, requires **strict building codes and preparedness**. This event highlights the need for **awareness, infrastructure resilience, and emergency response planning** to mitigate future risks.

# Eroding federalism

# **Eroding Federalism in India: A Growing Concern**

Federalism in India is a fundamental feature of the Constitution, ensuring a balance of power between the **Union and State governments**. However, in recent years, there have been concerns regarding the **centralization of power**, weakening the autonomy of states and affecting cooperative federalism. This erosion of federalism is visible in multiple areas, including **legislative control, fiscal autonomy, linguistic policies, judicial independence, and executive influence**.

---

## **1. Centralization of Legislative Powers**
- The Union government has increasingly bypassed state governments while implementing **laws and policies in state subjects**.
- **Statutory regulatory bodies**, which originally had advisory roles, now make significant policy decisions, reducing state control.
- The **farm laws (2020, later repealed)** and the **implementation of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA)** are examples where states were not consulted adequately before making national-level decisions.
- The introduction of **central laws in opposition to state policies** has sparked concerns about encroaching upon state powers.

---

## **2. Strains on Fiscal Federalism**
- The financial relations between the Centre and the states have become a **major area of conflict**.
- The **Reserve Bank of India (RBI)** has expressed concerns over the increasing **debt levels of states**, urging them to rationalize expenditures.
- **Decreasing the share of states in tax devolution** and increased reliance on centrally sponsored schemes have reduced states’ financial independence.
- **Goods and Services Tax (GST) compensation delays** have further weakened states' ability to manage their fiscal policies independently.

---

## **3. Linguistic and Cultural Centralization**
- The **push for Hindi as a national language** has been met with strong resistance from non-Hindi-speaking states.
- Policies promoting Hindi over regional languages in **education, government administration, and public services** have created tensions, especially in **Southern and Northeastern states**.
- Many state governments have **demanded the protection of their linguistic diversity**, citing the need for a **pluralistic approach rather than imposing a single language**.

---

## **4. Diminishing Regional Autonomy**
- The **revocation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir (2019)**, which led to the removal of its **special status**, is often cited as an example of weakening federalism.
- The **reorganization of the region into two Union Territories** was done without the consent of its elected representatives, setting a precedent for unilateral central decisions.
- Recently, **calls to restore partial autonomy have been rejected** by the central government, emphasizing a uniform national approach over regional aspirations.

---

## **5. Executive Influence Over the Judiciary**
- The **judiciary is meant to act as a check on executive overreach**, but concerns have been raised about its increasing alignment with the executive.
- Instances where **senior judicial officials have participated in political or religious events alongside executive leaders** have led to debates about the **erosion of judicial neutrality**.
- This undermines the **principle of separation of powers**, which is crucial for maintaining federalism.

---

## **6. Political and Administrative Control Over States**
- The **use of the Governor’s office** to override elected state governments has been another issue.
- In multiple instances, Governors have been accused of **delaying bills passed by state legislatures**, challenging the democratic mandate of state governments.
- **Frequent interference in opposition-led states** has led to political instability and administrative delays.

---

## **Conclusion**
The **erosion of federalism** in India is a growing concern that affects **state autonomy, fiscal policies, linguistic rights, judicial independence, and governance structures**. While a **strong central government** is essential for national unity, an **over-centralized approach** risks alienating states and weakening the federal structure envisioned by the Constitution. To maintain **cooperative federalism**, there must be **greater consultation between the Union and States, financial empowerment of state governments, and judicial independence to uphold federal principles**.

> India's federal structure is facing challenges due to increasing **centralization of power**, affecting state autonomy. Legislative decisions bypassing states, **fiscal strains**, and **GST compensation delays** weaken financial independence. The **promotion of Hindi over regional languages** has caused linguistic tensions. The **revocation of Article 370** in Jammu and Kashmir and political interference in opposition-led states raise concerns about **regional autonomy**. The **judiciary's alignment with the executive** threatens the separation of powers. **Governors delaying state bills** further erodes federalism. Strengthening **cooperative federalism** through better **Centre-State consultation, fiscal devolution, and judicial neutrality** is essential to uphold India’s constitutional balance.

# How did a DDoS attack cripple Kaveri 2.0?

In January, web-based portal Kaveri 2.0, which streamlines property registrations in Karnataka, faced sporadic, crippling server outages. On investigating the outage, the Revenue Department and E-Governance Department concluded that it was not due to “technical glitches” but a “motivated Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack” on Kaveri 2.0, which was launched in 2023 to reform land registration.

### What happened after the attack?

Following the incident, K. A. Dayananda, Inspector General of Registrations and Commissioner of Stamps (IGR & CS) lodged a complaint with the cyber-crime police. The Cybercrime, Economic offences, Narcotics (CEN) police registered a case under the Information Technology Act, 2000, against the unidentified miscreants. “The Kaveri 2.0 faced some performance issues during December 2024. Upon analysis and inputs from the Centre for Smart Governance [CSG], it was found that these issues were caused by a malicious DDoS attack using automated tools or bots,” the FIR said.

### What is a DDoS attack?

A DDoS attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal functioning of a targeted server, service, or network by overwhelming it with a flood of internet traffic. Unlike a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, which typically involves a single source, a DDoS attack leverages multiple compromised systems, often infected with malware, to generate the traffic. These compromised systems are collectively known as a botnet. Such attacks may be aimed at saturating the bandwidth of a particular site, exploiting weaknesses in the network protocol stack, or targeting specific weaknesses in applications or services. DDoS attacks can lead to service downtime, which render services unavailable, leading to a disruption or potential loss of revenue. While DDoS attacks do not directly steal data, they can be used as a distraction while other forms of cyberattack, such as data breaches, are executed. Organisations that fall victim to DDoS attacks may suffer reputational damage, as customers and partners question their ability to protect against cyber threats.

### What happened to Kaveri 2.0?

The Kaveri 2.0 portal experienced performance issues in December 2024 and January 2025. Fake accounts were created, and entries were made into the database using these accounts, overwhelming the system. The attack involved 62 email accounts originating from 14 IP addresses, highlighting the distributed nature of the assault. In January 2025, a similar attack occurred, with extremely high traffic observed from citizen-side users for Encumbrance Certificate (EC) searches, which was eight times more than usual. At one point, the portal received 6.2 lakh requests in just two hours from malicious users using random keywords to perform searches. This surge in traffic crippled the portal, reducing the number of registrations.

### How can such attacks be mitigated?

To protect against DDoS attacks, organisations implement advanced traffic filtering mechanisms to distinguish between legitimate and malicious traffic. Monitoring tools can help identify unusual traffic patterns and take pre-emptive actions. Enforcing rate limiting can control the number of requests a user can make in a given time frame, preventing the system from being overwhelmed. Bot detection technologies, such as CAPTCHA challenges and behavioural analysis, can identify and block automated tools or bots. Additionally, robust authentication mechanisms and regular security audits can strengthen the security of online services and prevent unauthorised access. Organisations can also work closely with cybersecurity agencies to help investigate attacks and identify perpetrators. They can share information and collaborate on mitigation strategies to prevent future attacks. This will include having a dedicated team to monitor and respond to security incidents. For the user, knowing about the risks of phishing and other social engineering attacks can help prevent account compromises.

### What next for Kaveri 2.0?

The cyberattack crippled the Kaveri 2.0 portal, and registrations fell significantly on February 1 and 4. While the portal was restored on February 5, the DDoS attack should serve as a wake-up call for organisations, particularly government agencies, to prioritise cybersecurity and implement robust mitigation strategies.

### What are other major DDoS attacks?

There are several such attacks, but most recently Elon Musk-owned X was targeted in August 2024. Mr. Musk reported that the platform experienced a massive DDoS attack, which caused delays and disruptions. This attack occurred just before his scheduled conversation with U.S. President Donald Trump, highlighting the vulnerability of even high-profile platforms to cyber threats.

In another occasion, in 2015, Microsoft-owned code repository GitHub was targeted by a China-based botnet. The attack specifically aimed two GitHub projects that provided tools to circumvent Chinese censorship. The attack involved injecting malicious JavaScript code into the browsers of visitors to Baidu, China’s most popular search engine, and other sites using Baidu’s analytics services.

In early February 2025, Karnataka's property registration portal, **Kaveri 2.0**, experienced significant disruptions due to a **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack**. This cyberattack overwhelmed the system with excessive traffic, rendering it inaccessible to legitimate users and severely impacting property registrations across the state.

**Nature of the Attack**

A DDoS attack involves multiple compromised systems flooding a target with superfluous requests, causing service disruptions. In the case of Kaveri 2.0, the portal was inundated with automated searches initiated through customer logins. Bots executed large-scale searches, overwhelming the system and leading to a crash. The attack was continuous and strategic, allowing perpetrators to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in real-time. Officials from the e-governance department observed an unusual concentration of portal visits from specific locations, raising suspicions of a coordinated cyberattack. This pattern prompted the decision to involve law enforcement for a formal investigation.

**Impact on Services**

The attack led to severe disruptions in property registration services, significantly affecting revenue collection for nearly a month. Despite efforts by officials from the revenue and e-governance departments, the underlying issues persisted until the nature of the attack was identified. The portal's downtime caused inconvenience to citizens and raised concerns about the security of governmental digital services. 

**Restoration Efforts**

Upon identifying the DDoS attack as the root cause, cybersecurity experts recommended several measures to safeguard the portal against future incidents. These included:

- **AI-Based Threat Detection**: Implementing systems to distinguish between legitimate users and bot traffic.

- **Rate-Limiting Techniques**: Curbing excessive requests from individual users to prevent overload.

- **Enhanced Firewall Settings**: Blocking malicious IP addresses effectively.

- **Use of CAPTCHAs and Multi-Factor Authentication**: Ensuring that users accessing the system are genuine.

- **Cloud-Based DDoS Protection Services**: Leveraging scalable resources to absorb and mitigate attack traffic.

- **Increased Server Capacity and Redundancy**: Enhancing infrastructure to handle unexpected surges in traffic.

- **Dedicated Cybersecurity Response Team**: Establishing a team for immediate action during incidents.

By early February 2025, these measures led to the full restoration of Kaveri 2.0 services. On February 5, property registrations climbed to 7,225, signaling a return to normalcy. 

**Preventive Measures and Future Outlook**

The Kaveri 2.0 incident underscores the importance of robust cybersecurity frameworks for critical public services. To prevent similar occurrences, organizations should:

- **Regular Security Audits**: Identifying and addressing vulnerabilities proactively.

- **Employee Training**: Educating staff about potential threats and response protocols.

- **Incident Response Planning**: Establishing clear procedures for various cyberattack scenarios.

- **Collaboration with Cybersecurity Experts**: Engaging professionals to stay updated on emerging threats and defenses.

By adopting these measures, governmental portals like Kaveri 2.0 can enhance their resilience against cyberattacks, ensuring uninterrupted service delivery to the public.

> In **February 2025**, Karnataka’s **Kaveri 2.0 property registration portal** suffered a **DDoS attack**, overwhelming it with excessive automated searches and causing a major service disruption. This cyberattack, which lasted for nearly a month, significantly affected **property registrations and revenue collection**.
