# Trump proposes tariffs on steel, aluminium imports. how it will impact?

On February 10, 2025, President Donald Trump announced the imposition of a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports into the United States, effective March 4, 2025. This policy marks a significant shift from previous trade practices, as it applies universally without exemptions for traditional allies such as Canada, Mexico, Japan, and South Korea. The administration's stated objectives are to bolster domestic industries, address perceived unfair trade practices, and enhance national security.

**Rationale Behind the Tariffs**

The primary motivation for these tariffs is to revitalize the U.S. steel and aluminum industries, which have faced challenges due to global competition and alleged unfair trade practices. By imposing a 25% tariff, the administration aims to make foreign metals more expensive, thereby encouraging domestic production and consumption. This move is intended to protect American jobs in these sectors and reduce reliance on foreign imports.

Additionally, the administration has expressed concerns over global trade practices, particularly subsidies provided by other governments, which are seen as creating an uneven playing field. By implementing these tariffs, the U.S. seeks to address these disparities and promote fairer trade conditions. 

**Potential Impacts of the Tariffs**

*Economic Effects:*

While the tariffs aim to protect domestic industries, they may lead to increased costs for U.S. manufacturers that rely on imported steel and aluminum. These higher input costs could result in elevated prices for consumers on products ranging from automobiles to household appliances. A study of previous steel tariffs indicated that such measures could lead to job losses in manufacturing sectors that depend on these materials, potentially offsetting gains in the steel and aluminum industries. 

*International Trade Relations:*

The universal application of these tariffs, without exemptions for allies, has the potential to strain relationships with key trading partners. Countries like Canada and South Korea have expressed concerns over the lack of justification for the tariffs and their potential economic impacts. This move could lead to retaliatory measures, resulting in a cycle of escalating trade tensions. 

*Global Trade Dynamics:*

The imposition of these tariffs may disrupt global supply chains, as countries seek alternative markets and suppliers. Emerging economies could face economic strain due to reduced access to the U.S. market, potentially leading to broader economic implications. The tariffs also signal a shift towards more protectionist trade policies, which could influence global trade norms and practices. 

**Conclusion**

President Trump's decision to impose a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports is driven by a desire to protect domestic industries and address perceived unfair trade practices. While the policy aims to bolster the U.S. economy, it carries potential risks, including higher costs for manufacturers and consumers, strained international relations, and disruptions to global trade dynamics. The long-term effects of these tariffs will depend on how domestic industries adapt and how international partners respond to this significant shift in U.S. trade policy.

# Troubled waters

### **The Palk Bay Fisheries Dispute: A Deepening Conflict and the Need for a Sustainable Solution**

The fisheries dispute in the Palk Bay region remains one of the most persistent and sensitive issues between India and Sri Lanka. The recent **arrest of 14 Indian fishermen from Tamil Nadu’s Ramanathapuram district** by the Sri Lankan Navy on February 8, 2025, and the seizure of two trawlers has once again highlighted the severity of this ongoing conflict. This incident follows the **firing on an Indian boat near Delft Island on January 27**, which left two fishermen injured. The situation is worsening, as **the number of Indian fishermen detained this year has already reached 77**. With over **500 Indian fishermen arrested in Sri Lanka in 2024**, this issue demands immediate diplomatic intervention and a long-term sustainable resolution.

### **Underlying Causes of the Conflict**
The core issue stems from **fishermen crossing the International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL)** into Sri Lankan waters. Indian fishermen, especially from Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, frequently venture into Sri Lankan waters due to **depleting fish stocks on the Indian side**. The **use of bottom trawling**, an ecologically destructive method that damages marine biodiversity, has further worsened the problem. This practice not only **harms fish populations** but also disrupts **Sri Lankan fishermen’s livelihoods**, particularly those from the Tamil-speaking **Northern Province**, who are still recovering from the economic devastation caused by the Sri Lankan Civil War.

### **Sri Lanka’s Response and Legal Actions**
Unlike in the past, when detained fishermen were **quickly released**, Sri Lanka has adopted **stricter enforcement measures** in recent years. Fishermen are now **facing prolonged detentions, hefty fines, and even prison sentences**. A **Sri Lankan court recently sentenced an Indian fisherman to six months in prison**, demonstrating a **harsher legal approach**. Tamil Nadu Chief Minister **M.K. Stalin has reported that 97 Indian fishermen and 216 boats** remain in Sri Lankan custody, signaling **growing tensions and a hardening of Colombo’s stance**.

### **Diplomatic Stalemate and Lack of Dialogue**
Efforts to resolve the issue through **bilateral discussions and diplomatic channels** have largely failed. The last major round of **talks between Indian and Sri Lankan fishing communities was held in 2016**. The issue was again raised during the **Joint Working Group meeting in Colombo in October 2024**, but the **Sri Lankan government, under Anura Kumara Dissanayake, has shown reluctance** to engage in fresh negotiations. This **lack of dialogue** exacerbates tensions and deepens the crisis.

### **A Comparative Perspective: India’s Fishermen in Other Countries**
India has also witnessed the **arrests of fishermen in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar**, but the number of **detentions in Sri Lanka remains disproportionately high**. Unlike the cases involving Pakistan or the Middle East, where diplomatic efforts often result in **relatively quick releases**, Sri Lanka’s **legal actions against Indian fishermen have intensified**. This suggests that the dispute is **not merely a border issue but also involves economic and environmental concerns**.

### **The Way Forward: A Sustainable and Diplomatic Approach**
The Palk Bay dispute requires a **comprehensive and sustainable solution** involving both **immediate diplomatic actions and long-term structural reforms**. The following steps can help resolve the crisis:

1. **Immediate Diplomatic Engagement**  
   - The **Indian government must push for urgent negotiations** between the two nations.  
   - A fresh round of **talks between Indian and Sri Lankan fishermen** should be arranged to reach a mutual understanding.  
   - The **release of detained Indian fishermen and confiscated boats** should be a priority in diplomatic talks.

2. **Regulation of Fishing Practices**  
   - New Delhi must introduce **financial incentives** to help **Palk Bay fishermen transition away from bottom trawling**.  
   - The Indian government should **support alternative fishing techniques** that are **sustainable and environmentally friendly**.  
   - Investment in **deep-sea fishing technology** should be encouraged, reducing the dependency on Palk Bay fishing grounds.

3. **Joint Monitoring and Conflict Prevention**  
   - Both countries should establish a **joint surveillance mechanism** to prevent **illegal fishing activities** while ensuring **fair treatment of fishermen**.  
   - A **bilateral dispute resolution mechanism** should be created to handle **future conflicts peacefully**.  
   - **Exchange programs between fishing communities** could help **build trust and cooperation**.

4. **Strengthening India’s Domestic Fisheries Policies**  
   - The Indian government must **develop policies to boost fish stocks on the Indian side**, reducing the need for cross-border fishing.  
   - More **marine protected areas (MPAs)** should be established to allow fish populations to regenerate.  
   - Enhanced **coastal community development programs** can help fishermen explore **alternative livelihoods**.

### **Conclusion**
The **Palk Bay fisheries dispute is no longer just a border issue**; it involves economic livelihoods, environmental sustainability, and diplomatic relations. The recent **increase in arrests, harsh sentences, and escalating tensions** indicate that the traditional **business-as-usual approach is failing**. Both **New Delhi and Colombo must recognize the urgency** of the situation and adopt a **fresh, multi-pronged strategy** that balances **fishermen’s livelihoods with environmental conservation and diplomatic stability**. Without a proactive approach, this issue will continue to strain Indo-Sri Lankan relations and disrupt the fragile balance in the region.

> The **Palk Bay fisheries dispute** remains a key Indo-Sri Lankan conflict, with **14 Tamil Nadu fishermen arrested on February 8, 2025**, adding to **77 detentions this year**. Sri Lanka has intensified enforcement, imposing **prison sentences and hefty fines** for crossing the **International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL)** and using **bottom trawling**, which depletes marine resources. Diplomatic efforts remain stalled, with the last major talks in **2016**. To resolve this, India must **push for negotiations, regulate fishing practices, promote sustainable alternatives, and strengthen monitoring**. A proactive **bilateral approach** is essential to balance **livelihoods, environmental conservation, and regional stability**.
