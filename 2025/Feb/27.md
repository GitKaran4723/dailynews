# A leap backward for maternity entitlements

### **A Leap Backward for Maternity Entitlements**

#### **Introduction**
Maternity entitlements are crucial for ensuring the health, well-being, and economic security of women and their newborns. In India, the **Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act, 2017**, increased paid maternity leave from **12 to 26 weeks**, aiming to support working mothers. Additionally, the **Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY)** was launched in 2017 to provide **financial assistance to pregnant and lactating mothers**. However, recent policy shifts and budget cuts have led to a **decline in maternity benefits**, affecting millions of women, particularly those in the **unorganized sector**.

#### **Declining Support for Maternity Entitlements**
Despite progressive legislation, recent policy changes indicate a **regression in maternity entitlements**, particularly for economically vulnerable women.

1. **Reduced Financial Assistance Under PMMVY**
   - The PMMVY initially promised **₹6,000 per child**, in line with the **National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013**. However, under the scheme, women receive only **₹5,000**, with some states adding minor top-ups.
   - The benefits have now been restricted to the **first child only**, disregarding the financial burden of additional pregnancies.
   - The scheme’s budget has consistently decreased, limiting its reach.

2. **Exclusion of Informal Sector Workers**
   - The **Maternity Benefit Act, 2017**, largely benefits **women in formal employment**, covering only about **1% of working women**.
   - Nearly **90% of Indian women work in the informal sector** (agriculture, domestic work, daily wage labor) and are **not covered** under employer-paid maternity leave provisions.
   - Many women are forced to **return to work early**, risking their **own health and infant well-being**.

3. **Budget Cuts and Implementation Gaps**
   - Funding for **nutrition and maternal welfare programs** has declined in recent budgets.
   - The **Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS)** and **Anganwadi services** face underfunding, impacting maternal and child nutrition.
   - The **application process for PMMVY** is **bureaucratic and time-consuming**, discouraging many eligible women from availing benefits.

4. **Workplace Discrimination**
   - Many private-sector employers hesitate to hire women due to the **financial burden of extended maternity leave**.
   - Women often face **job loss, pay cuts, or career stagnation** post-maternity, worsening gender disparities in the workforce.

5. **Health and Economic Impacts**
   - Lack of adequate maternity support contributes to **high maternal and infant mortality rates**.
   - Poor maternal nutrition leads to **low birth weight and stunted growth** in children.
   - The financial strain on families pushes many **poor women back into labor-intensive work** soon after childbirth.

#### **Way Forward**
1. **Universal Maternity Benefits**: Expand coverage beyond the first child and include **all women, especially informal workers**.
2. **Better Budget Allocation**: Increase funding for **PMMVY, ICDS, and Anganwadi services**.
3. **Employer and Government Contribution**: Implement a **shared cost model** between employers and the government.
4. **Strengthening Implementation**: Simplify procedures and ensure **direct cash transfers** to beneficiaries.

#### **Conclusion**
Maternity entitlements are not just **welfare measures** but **essential investments in women's health, child development, and economic equality**. Rolling back benefits undermines **women’s rights, workforce participation, and long-term socio-economic progress**. Instead of reducing support, the government must **strengthen and expand maternity entitlements** to ensure a healthier and more equitable future for all.

> India’s **maternity entitlements** are regressing despite past progress. The **Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY)** provides only **₹5,000**, restricted to the **first child**, excluding many women, especially informal workers. Budget cuts and **bureaucratic hurdles** further limit access. The **Maternity Benefit Act, 2017**, benefits only **1% of working women**, leaving **90% in the informal sector** unprotected. Lack of support forces poor women **back to work early**, affecting maternal and child health. To reverse this setback, India must **expand maternity benefits, increase funding, and strengthen implementation**, ensuring **better health, financial security, and gender equality** for women and their children.

# A message to district magistrates and the police

### **Analysis of the FIRs Filed Under BNS and BNSS in Indore: A Legal and Ethical Perspective**  

#### **Introduction**  
The recent **FIRs in Indore** under the **Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) Section 223** and **Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) Section 163** have sparked legal and ethical debates. These provisions correspond to **Section 188 IPC** (disobedience of public servant’s order) and **Section 144 CrPC** (prohibitory orders), respectively. The **district administration’s ban on begging** aims to make Indore **beggar-free**, but the FIRs—one against a person for **giving alms** and another against a **beggar’s son**—raise **constitutional, legal, humanitarian, and practical concerns**.

---

### **Legal Perspective**
1. **Provisions Applied**  
   - **Section 223 of BNS (Similar to Section 188 IPC)** punishes those who violate government orders, ensuring compliance with administrative directives.  
   - **Section 163 of BNSS (Similar to Section 144 CrPC)** allows District Magistrates to issue prohibitory orders for maintaining public order.  

2. **Legality of the Prohibitory Order**  
   - The **ban on begging** is a policy decision, but it must align with **constitutional rights** and **Supreme Court judgments**.  
   - Courts have ruled that **poverty and survival struggles cannot be criminalized**. For instance, the **Supreme Court in Harsh Mander v. Union of India (2018)** questioned laws penalizing beggary.  

3. **FIR Against Almsgiver**  
   - Filing an FIR against someone for **giving alms** is **unprecedented** and **highly debatable**.  
   - While the state can regulate public spaces, **giving charity is a fundamental part of Indian culture and protected under personal liberty (Article 21)**.  

4. **FIR Against the Beggar’s Son**  
   - Holding a son accountable for his **mother’s begging actions** raises **ethical and legal concerns**.  
   - There is **no legal provision** that mandates an adult child to prevent a parent from begging.  
   - Such enforcement **could violate personal freedoms** and **lead to unjust targeting of poor families**.  

---

### **Ethical and Humanitarian Concerns**
1. **Criminalizing Poverty vs. Addressing Root Causes**  
   - The **real issue is poverty, lack of employment, and social security**, not begging itself.  
   - Punishing beggars or almsgivers **does not address structural problems** like **unemployment, lack of shelters, or mental health issues**.  

2. **Violation of Fundamental Rights**  
   - **Right to Life and Dignity (Article 21)**: Penalizing beggars without providing alternatives undermines **human dignity**.  
   - **Freedom of Religion and Charity (Article 25)**: Many religions encourage **giving alms** as a moral duty. Restricting this **violates cultural and religious practices**.  

3. **Failure to Implement Welfare Measures**  
   - If the state **lacks rehabilitation measures**, imposing **bans without solutions** is unjust.  
   - Instead of filing FIRs, **improving homeless shelters, skill training, and financial aid** should be prioritized.  

---

### **Practical Challenges**
1. **Enforceability Issues**  
   - Policing **every person giving alms** is impractical and can lead to **harassment by authorities**.  
   - Targeting family members of beggars may **create social distress** and **increase fear among the poor**.  

2. **Counterproductive Approach**  
   - **Begging eradication needs social reforms, not just legal actions**.  
   - Harsh enforcement **might push beggars into crime or exploitation**.  

---

### **Conclusion & Way Forward**
The **Indore administration’s move**, though intended to maintain **public order**, raises **serious legal, ethical, and humanitarian concerns**. **Punishing poverty instead of addressing its causes is a step backward**.  

#### **Recommendations:**  
1. **Focus on Rehabilitation**: Establish **shelters, vocational training, and employment programs** for beggars.  
2. **Legal Clarity**: Laws should differentiate between **organized begging mafias** and **genuine poor individuals** seeking help.  
3. **Public Awareness**: Instead of **penalizing almsgiving**, promote **alternative donation channels** like verified NGOs.  
4. **Judicial Review**: Courts should examine the **constitutional validity** of such prohibitory orders.  

India needs **holistic poverty alleviation, not legal repression**, to create a **just and inclusive society**.

> The **Indore administration’s crackdown on begging** under **BNS Section 223** and **BNSS Section 163** has raised legal, ethical, and humanitarian concerns. Filing FIRs against an **almsgiver and a beggar’s son** reflects **criminalization of poverty** rather than addressing its root causes. While maintaining public order is essential, punishing **charity and family members** of beggars is **unjust and impractical**. Instead of legal penalties, the government should focus on **rehabilitation, employment, and shelter programs**. A **holistic approach**, including judicial review and public awareness, is needed to tackle **begging mafias** while protecting **the poor’s dignity and fundamental rights**.

# The impact of ethanol on the environment

Concerns about the **Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) programme** refuse to die down in Andhra Pradesh, with scientists and farmers saying water resources are depleting and emissions from factories are **polluting the air, water, and soil**.

Buoyed by the encouraging results of the **Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) programme**, which was introduced in India as a pilot project in 2001, the Central government in 2020 decided to advance the target of **20% ethanol blending in petrol from 2030 to 2025** as the way towards a greener future. The **EBP programme** was said to be the way of addressing multiple concerns — of growing energy consumption, oil imports, and increasing carbon emissions from vehicles. Under the EBP, ethanol is made using grains, such as broken rice and corn, and is therefore said to double farmers’ income as well.

As of 2024, the blend percentage was **15% in the country**. To meet the required target of 20% ethanol in petrol by 2025-26, **1,016 crore litres of ethanol** would be required. The Centre announced relaxations in the application processes for environmental clearance and also offered subsidies on purchase of grains to ensure a smoother process for ethanol factories.

Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Haryana and Punjab have the highest number of ethanol factories in the country, contributing a substantial portion to the overall production capacity of 947 crore litres in 2022, as per information provided by former Union Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti, to the Lok Sabha.

Since 2024, there have been continuous protests at the **Gummaladoddi, Gandepalli, Arugolanu** villages in Andhra Pradesh against the EBP programme. All the three villages are located near a river or a canal, which is the source of drinking water and agricultural needs. **Lokayukta officials had also said officials of the Pollution Control Board had failed to take action in 2022** against a factory producing ethanol since 2008 in Gandepalli despite knowing that effluents were being discharged into a nearby canal, which is used by farmers for agricultural purposes.

Much of the confusion regarding how polluting an ethanol plant can be arises from the fact that environmental clearances do not mention emissions to begin with. Experts say that hazardous, cancer-causing chemicals such as acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, and acrolein are some of the emissions from ethanol factories, but these don’t find a mention in the clearances given to the ethanol factories in the East Godavari, Krishna and NTR districts in the State, as per environmentalists.

All ethanol production plants and distilleries fall under the **‘red category’**, which means that they have a pollution score of **60 or more**, as per Central government norms. But to facilitate a smoother and quicker clearance process, the Centre has allowed them to be set up without public hearings. Many of them are near human settlements.

Farmers also fear that the water-guzzling factories will leave them with no water for their crops. Their fears are not unfounded. Scientists for People, a collective of scientists based in Hyderabad, argue that a grain-based ethanol factory requires 8-12 litres of water per litre of ethanol. With the flow in perennial rivers such as the Krishna being lean for most of the year, factories located near these rivers depend on groundwater, which is a contravention of the rules.

A **Niti Aayog report states that when petrol was blended with 20% of the biofuel, carbon monoxide reduced by 30% in four wheelers and 50% in two wheelers**. While this may be true, scientists and environmentalists ask of what use the EBP programme is if the gains achieved are negated by the harmful chemicals released into the atmosphere during the process. On the one hand, environmentalists say the processes involved in the making of biofuel make it more harmful for the environment. On the other, industrialists say many factories cannot afford pollution control measures because of rising production and labour costs.

Without dismissing environmentalists for being **“anti-development”**, the governments would do well to listen to their concerns and adopt corrective measures. After all, their collective goal remains the same — to work towards a greener future. This cannot come at the cost of agriculture, health, and the riparian rights of the people.

> Ethanol, a **biofuel derived from crops like sugarcane and corn**, has **both positive and negative environmental impacts**. It reduces **greenhouse gas emissions** by lowering dependence on fossil fuels, making it a **cleaner alternative**. However, large-scale ethanol production leads to **deforestation, excessive water use, and soil degradation**. Fertilizer use in ethanol crops can cause **water pollution** and **biodiversity loss**. While it reduces **air pollution**, ethanol-blended fuels still emit carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides. A **balanced approach**, including **sustainable farming, efficient land use, and advanced biofuels**, is necessary to **maximize benefits while minimizing ecological harm**.

# Panel seeks penalties to end proxy rule by male kin of women panchayat leaders

### **Panel Seeks Penalties to End Proxy Rule by Male Kin of Women Panchayat Leaders**  

#### **Introduction**  
In India, the **Panchayati Raj system** has been instrumental in promoting **grassroots democracy**, and **women’s reservation in local governance** has been a significant step toward gender equality. However, despite **33-50% reservation for women** in panchayats across states, a persistent issue is the **proxy rule by male relatives**, often called **“Sarpanch Pati” (husband of the elected woman leader)**. A government-appointed **panel has now recommended strict penalties** to curb this practice, ensuring **real empowerment** of elected women leaders.

---

## **1. The Issue of Proxy Rule in Panchayats**  
1. **Definition of Proxy Rule**  
   - Many **women sarpanches (village heads) and panchayat members** are elected due to **mandatory reservations**, but **male family members (husbands, fathers, brothers, or in-laws)** often make decisions on their behalf.  
   - These men **attend meetings, handle administration, and control funds**, sidelining the **elected woman leader**.  

2. **Reasons for the Proxy System**  
   - **Patriarchal Mindset:** Many men consider women unfit for leadership roles and see their election as a **formality**.  
   - **Lack of Education and Confidence:** Some elected women, especially in rural areas, may **lack formal education or governance experience**, making them reliant on male relatives.  
   - **Political Dynasties:** In some cases, women are fielded by powerful families to **retain control over local governance**, with the real authority staying in the hands of male kin.  

---

## **2. Recommendations of the Panel**  
The panel, comprising **governance experts and women’s rights activists**, has suggested **legal and administrative measures** to ensure that women **exercise real power** in local governance.  

1. **Strict Penalties for Proxy Governance**  
   - Male relatives acting as **de facto panchayat heads** should face **fines, disqualification from contesting elections, and even legal action**.  
   - State governments should issue **mandatory guidelines banning male relatives from attending official meetings** in place of women leaders.  

2. **Mandatory Training for Women Panchayat Leaders**  
   - **Capacity-building programs** should be implemented to train elected women in **governance, financial management, and legal rights**.  
   - **Regular workshops and leadership programs** will help women **gain confidence and autonomy** in decision-making.  

3. **Strict Monitoring and Reporting Mechanisms**  
   - Setting up **vigilance committees** at district and state levels to **identify and act against cases of proxy rule**.  
   - Encouraging women leaders to **report cases** where they are being sidelined by male kin.  

4. **Awareness Campaigns and Community Mobilization**  
   - Conduct **awareness drives** to change societal attitudes and encourage **families to support women’s independent leadership**.  
   - **NGOs and women’s organizations** should play an active role in empowering women leaders.  

---

## **3. Expected Impact of These Measures**  
1. **Genuine Women’s Empowerment**  
   - If implemented effectively, these measures will **ensure that elected women leaders actually exercise their authority**, rather than acting as figureheads.  

2. **Strengthening Grassroots Democracy**  
   - Real participation of women will lead to **better decision-making, inclusive policies, and development-focused governance** in rural areas.  

3. **Breaking the Cycle of Patriarchy**  
   - By removing male dominance in women-led panchayats, the measures will **challenge deep-rooted gender biases** and promote a **more equitable society**.  

---

## **Conclusion**  
The panel’s recommendations mark a **significant step toward gender justice** in local governance. While **reservation for women in panchayats is a progressive policy**, its impact is diluted if men continue to **wield power behind the scenes**. **Strict penalties, training, and awareness** are necessary to ensure **women exercise their rightful authority**, breaking the cycle of **proxy rule** and strengthening democracy at the grassroots level.

> A **government panel** has recommended **penalties** to curb the **proxy rule by male relatives** of elected women **panchayat leaders**, ensuring real empowerment. Many **women sarpanches** serve as figureheads while **husbands or male kin** make decisions. To tackle this, the panel suggests **strict fines, disqualification, and legal action** against such practices. It also proposes **mandatory training for women leaders, monitoring mechanisms, and awareness campaigns** to boost their confidence and autonomy. These reforms aim to **strengthen grassroots democracy**, **challenge patriarchal norms**, and ensure women in governance exercise **real authority**, making **reservation policies effective in achieving gender equality in local governance**.
