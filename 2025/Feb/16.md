# Stubble burning contributes only 14% PM2.5 in Delhi-NCR: study

Recent studies have provided nuanced insights into the contribution of stubble burning to PM2.5 pollution in Delhi-National Capital Region (NCR). While traditionally, agricultural residue burning in neighboring states like Punjab and Haryana has been considered a significant contributor to Delhi's air quality deterioration during the post-monsoon season, recent data suggests a more complex scenario.

**Key Findings:**

1. **14% Contribution in 2022:** A study published in 'npj Climate and Atmospheric Science' analyzed PM2.5 data from September to November 2022 and 2023. The research, which involved 30 sensors across Punjab, Haryana, and Delhi-NCR, found that emissions from stubble burning in Punjab contributed approximately 14% to the overall PM2.5 levels in Delhi-NCR during October-November 2022. This indicates that while stubble burning does impact air quality, its contribution might be less than previously assumed.

2. **Declining Fire Incidents:** Data from the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) highlights a significant reduction in paddy stubble burning incidents. Between 2022 and 2024, Punjab saw a decrease from 48,489 to 9,655 incidents, Haryana from 3,380 to 1,118, and Uttar Pradesh (NCR) from 72 to 192 incidents. This downward trend suggests that efforts to curb stubble burning are yielding results. 


3. **Variability in Contribution Estimates:** It's important to note that the contribution of stubble burning to PM2.5 levels varies across studies and timeframes. For instance, during October 12-21, 2024, stubble burning accounted for an average of only 0.92% of PM2.5 levels in Delhi. In contrast, other studies have reported contributions ranging from 10.6% on average, with peaks up to 35% during specific periods. 

**Implications:**

The data underscores that while stubble burning is a contributing factor to Delhi's air pollution, especially during certain periods, it is not the sole or dominant source. Local emissions from vehicles, industries, construction activities, and other urban sources play a substantial role in the region's air quality challenges. Therefore, comprehensive air quality management in Delhi-NCR requires addressing both external factors like stubble burning and internal sources of pollution.

In conclusion, while stubble burning does impact Delhi's air quality, its contribution is part of a broader spectrum of pollution sources. Effective mitigation strategies must adopt a holistic approach, targeting both agricultural practices in neighboring states and urban emission sources within Delhi-NCR.

### **Measures to Address Stubble Burning and Delhi's Air Pollution**

Given that stubble burning contributes to around **14% of PM2.5 pollution in Delhi-NCR**, the government has already taken several measures to control it, while further actions are still needed.

# Sex work drives mpox clade Ib outbreak in DR Congo

Mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, is a viral zoonotic disease caused by the monkeypox virus, a member of the Orthopoxvirus genus. It manifests with symptoms such as fever, headache, muscle aches, and a characteristic rash that progresses through several stages before scabbing over and healing. The disease is primarily transmitted through close contact with an infected individual or animal, as well as through contact with contaminated materials. While most individuals recover within a few weeks, certain clades of the virus, particularly Clade I, have been associated with higher mortality rates. 

In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), an outbreak of mpox Clade Ib has been closely linked to sex workers. A study conducted in the Kamituga region revealed that 83.4% of the 670 reported cases were associated with professional sexual interactions. This high percentage underscores the vulnerability of sex workers in the region. 


Several factors contribute to the heightened vulnerability of sex workers to mpox:

1. **Frequent Close Physical Contact**: The nature of sex work involves repeated close physical interactions, which facilitate the direct transmission of the virus through skin-to-skin contact.

2. **Limited Access to Healthcare**: Sex workers often face stigma and discrimination, leading to reduced access to medical services, preventive measures, and timely treatment.

3. **Economic Pressures**: Financial dependencies may compel sex workers to continue working even when symptomatic, increasing the risk of spreading the infection to clients and within their communities.

4. **Lack of Awareness**: There may be insufficient knowledge about mpox transmission and prevention among sex workers, hindering effective protective practices.

Addressing the mpox outbreak in the DRC, especially among sex workers, necessitates targeted public health interventions. These should include educational campaigns tailored to the community, improved access to healthcare services without discrimination, and economic support to reduce the necessity of working while ill. Such comprehensive strategies are essential to curb the spread of mpox and protect vulnerable populations. 

### **Comprehensive Analysis of Mpox (Monkeypox)**
---

### **1. Overview of Mpox (Monkeypox)**
Mpox, previously known as **monkeypox**, is a viral zoonotic disease caused by the **monkeypox virus (MPXV)**, a member of the *Orthopoxvirus* genus, related to the **smallpox virus (Variola)**. While it is less severe than smallpox, it can still cause significant morbidity, especially in immunocompromised individuals.

#### **Key Features of the Disease:**
- **Transmission:** Direct contact with skin lesions, bodily fluids, contaminated surfaces, and respiratory droplets.
- **Symptoms:** Fever, headache, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes, and a characteristic rash that progresses from macules to pustules before scabbing.
- **Mortality Rate:** Typically low, but varies by clade:
  - **Clade I (Central African lineage):** More severe, with a **higher case fatality rate (up to 10%)**.
  - **Clade II (West African lineage):** Less severe, with a **lower fatality rate (~1%)**.

### **2. The Recent Mpox Outbreak in DR Congo**
A significant outbreak of **Mpox Clade Ib** in the **Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)** has been linked to **sex work** as a major driver of transmission. 

#### **Key Findings from Recent Studies:**
- **High Prevalence in Sex Workers:** 83.4% of **reported cases in Kamituga** were linked to sexual contact.
- **Human-to-Human Transmission:** While previously considered a zoonotic disease, **human-to-human transmission has become dominant**, particularly in high-contact groups.
- **Economic and Healthcare Barriers:** Sex workers, due to social stigma and financial dependency, continue to work despite symptoms, exacerbating spread.

### **3. Why Are Sex Workers Highly Vulnerable?**
Sex workers are particularly vulnerable due to:
- **Frequent Close Physical Contact:** Direct skin-to-skin contact increases the chance of viral transmission.
- **Limited Access to Healthcare:** Stigmatization leads to a lack of medical consultation and early intervention.
- **Economic Constraints:** Many continue working despite symptoms due to financial necessity.
- **Lack of Awareness:** Insufficient knowledge about Mpox symptoms, transmission, and prevention.

### **4. Public Health Strategies for Containment**
To curb the outbreak, a **multi-pronged approach** is needed:
- **Vaccination Campaigns:** Targeted **JYNNEOS and ACAM2000 vaccines** for high-risk groups.
- **Community Awareness Programs:** Educating sex workers about Mpox symptoms and safe practices.
- **Accessible Healthcare:** Ensuring non-discriminatory medical services.
- **Economic Support:** Financial aid or alternative employment opportunities to reduce exposure.

### **5. Global Implications**
- The outbreak underscores the **need for global surveillance**, especially as Mpox has spread beyond Africa to **Europe and the Americas**.
- **Mutation risks** could make Mpox more transmissible, warranting **continuous monitoring and genomic analysis**.
- Lessons from **COVID-19** highlight the importance of **early intervention and global cooperation**.

# When can President’s Rule be imposed?

Four days after Manipur Chief Minister N. Biren Singh resigned, the State was put under President’s Rule on February 13. Though the ruling BJP still holds a majority in the Manipur Assembly, the party was unable to find a consensus Chief Minister candidate. The State has also been wracked by ethnic violence since May 2023, and Mr. Singh faced criticism for his handling of the conflict from many sides, including from within his own party. This is the 11th time that President’s Rule has been imposed in Manipur, the highest in any State.

### What is President’s Rule?

President’s Rule is a provision under Article 356 to be imposed in case of the failure of the constitutional machinery in a State. In such situations, based on a report by the State’s Governor or other inputs, the President can issue a Proclamation taking over the functions of the State’s government and Governor — effectively transferring them to the Union government — and transferring the powers of the State Assembly to Parliament. The President cannot, however, assume any of the powers vested in a High Court. The President’s proclamation must be laid before Parliament, and will expire in two months unless both Houses ratify it. It may be renewed by Parliament every six months, for a maximum period of three years. After the first year, renewal can take place under certain conditions, of an Emergency being declared in the country or the State, or the Election Commission declaring that State elections cannot be held.

Article 356 does not list the various specific circumstances under which President’s Rule can be imposed, leaving it to the judgment of the President (and the Union Council of Ministers advising her) to satisfy herself that “a situation has arisen in which the Government of the State cannot be carried on in accordance with the Provisions of this Constitution”. A comprehensive assessment of President’s Rule published by the Lok Sabha Secretariat in 2016 listed situations in which it has been imposed, apart from militancy and law and order: defections by MLAs, break-up of coalitions, passing of no-confidence motions, resignations of Chief Ministers, absence of legislatures in newly formed States, and public agitations leading to instability. The Supreme Court’s judgment in the 1994 S.R. Bommai vs Union of India case also listed the circumstances in which President’s Rule could and could not be imposed, though it made it clear this was not exhaustive.

### What are some previous instances of the imposition of President’s Rule?

President’s Rule has been imposed 135 times, in 35 States and Union Territories, including some that no longer exist. The first instance was in June 1951, in Punjab, when the State’s Chief Minister Gopi Chand Bhargava resigned due to internal differences in the Congress party. In all, Punjab has been under Central control for well over a decade. The only State which has spent more time under Central control is J&K, which has had President’s Rule imposed for almost 15 years (including in the Union Territory of J&K), with the longest continuous stints of more than six years each from 1990 to 1996 and from 2019 to 2024. After Manipur, the most frequent imposition of President’s Rule has been 10 times in Uttar Pradesh.

There have also been several instances of Article 356 being applied in cases where the same party is in power at both Centre and State, including in Andhra Pradesh in 1973, Assam in 1981, Gujarat in 1974, Karnataka in 1990, and now in Manipur in 2025.

In 1977, the newly elected Morarji Desai government imposed President’s Rule on nine Congress-ruled States at one go, claiming that they no longer held the confidence of the electorate which had voted out the Congress at the Centre. When Indira Gandhi returned to power in 1980, she returned the favour, imposing President’s Rule in nine States for the same reason. The Supreme Court at the time refused to interfere in the matter.

### Why has it become less frequent?

A few decades later, the Bommai judgment marked a shift in the court’s stance. The nine-judge Bench said that courts could review the President’s proclamation by “examining whether it was issued on the basis of any material at all or whether the material was relevant or whether the proclamation was issued in the mala fide exercise of the power,” former Attorney-General late Soli Sorabjee had said in a critique of the 1994 judgment. “This means the proclamation can be struck down if found to be unconstitutional. This is a clear deterrence to the government,” said P.D.T. Acharya, a former Lok Sabha Secretary General.

Between 1950 and 1994, President’s Rule was imposed 100 times, an average of 2.5 times a year. In the three decades since, it has been imposed 30 times or about once a year. In fact, the imposition in Manipur is the first since Puducherry in February 2021, almost four years ago. Since the Narendra Modi-led NDA government came to power in 2014, President’s Rule has been imposed 11 times, including four times in J&K. Of these, the courts have struck down the proclamation twice, in Arunachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.

### What does it mean to keep a legislature in suspended animation?

Though Manipur has been placed under President’s Rule, its Assembly has not been dissolved. Instead, it has been kept under suspended animation. When the Assembly is placed under suspended animation, it can be revived whenever it becomes possible to form a popular government after revoking President’s Rule.

> **President’s Rule** (Article **356**) is imposed when a state government **fails to function as per the Constitution**. It can be invoked if:  

1. The **Governor reports constitutional breakdown** in the state.  
2. The **state legislature fails** to elect a leader or pass a budget.  
3. There is **law and order failure or political instability**.  
4. The **state defies Union government directives** (Article **365**).  

Initially imposed for **six months**, it can be extended up to **three years** with **Parliament’s approval**. The **Governor administers the state** under the **President’s control**, but **judicial review prevents misuse** (S.R. Bommai case, 1994).
