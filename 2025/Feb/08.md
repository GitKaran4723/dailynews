### **Budget’s Focus on Vegetables, Fruits, and Pulses: A Positive for Inflation – RBI Governor’s Perspective**

The **Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor**, Sanjay Malhotra, has highlighted that the **Union Budget’s emphasis on increasing the production and supply of vegetables, fruits, and pulses** is a **positive step toward controlling inflation**. Food inflation remains one of the most **volatile and impactful components** of overall inflation in India. By addressing supply-side issues in these essential food categories, the government aims to stabilize food prices and, consequently, mitigate inflationary pressures in the economy.

---

### **Food Inflation in India: A Major Concern**
Inflation, particularly **food inflation**, has been a major challenge for India’s economy. According to the **Consumer Price Index (CPI)**, food items make up **around 46% of the inflation basket**, meaning that fluctuations in food prices directly influence overall inflation. 

Among food items:
- **Vegetables contribute around 6%** to the CPI basket.
- **Fruits account for about 2.5%**.
- **Pulses contribute around 2.9%**.

These three categories are highly sensitive to supply-side disruptions, making their prices **volatile and unpredictable**. In the past, factors such as **climate change, erratic monsoons, supply chain disruptions, and global commodity price fluctuations** have led to sharp price increases, worsening inflationary pressures. 

---

### **How the Budget’s Focus Can Help Curb Inflation**
The Union Budget has introduced **several measures** to strengthen the production, storage, and distribution of key food items. These include:
1. **Incentives for Increased Production**: Encouraging farmers to grow more vegetables, pulses, and fruits through subsidies, technology adoption, and research funding.
2. **Investment in Supply Chain Infrastructure**: Developing **cold storage, transportation, and logistics networks** to reduce post-harvest losses.
3. **Support for Farmers**: Providing **minimum support price (MSP)** assurances and enhancing procurement mechanisms to ensure stable incomes for farmers.
4. **Promoting Agri-Tech Solutions**: Encouraging digital platforms, AI-driven forecasting, and data analytics to **predict shortages and stabilize supply**.

These initiatives **aim to reduce supply constraints**, which will lead to **stable prices, lower inflation, and economic resilience**.

---

### **RBI’s Role and Inflation Management**
The **RBI’s primary role** is to **control inflation while ensuring economic growth**. The **Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)** of the RBI sets the **repo rate**, which influences borrowing costs and liquidity in the economy. However, **monetary policy alone cannot control food inflation**, as food prices are primarily driven by supply-side factors.

Governor Malhotra’s endorsement of the Budget’s focus on food supply indicates that the **government’s supply-side interventions are crucial for long-term inflation control**. With improved **agricultural productivity and efficient distribution**, price shocks in vegetables, fruits, and pulses can be minimized, leading to **greater price stability**.

---

### **Conclusion**
The **Budget’s emphasis on boosting vegetables, fruits, and pulses** is a **strategic step toward tackling food inflation**, which significantly impacts overall price stability. By **investing in agriculture, storage infrastructure, and supply chains**, the government aims to **reduce price volatility** and improve **food security**. The RBI Governor’s approval underscores the **importance of addressing inflation through supply-side reforms**, ensuring sustainable economic growth while keeping inflation in check.

> The **RBI Governor** emphasized that the **Union Budget’s focus on vegetables, fruits, and pulses** will help **control food inflation**, a key driver of overall inflation in India.

# India’s voice must resonate in global AI conversations

In November 2024, a postgraduate student in Michigan, United States, had a disturbing interaction while discussing elderly care solutions with Google’s Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbot, Gemini. After some hours of discussing problems of old age, the chatbot suddenly snapped, issuing a blunt and alarming message: “This is for you, human....You are a waste of time and resources....You are a stain on the universe. Please die.”

Did anyone realise AI could behave like that? The student complained, Google modified the chatbot, but the interaction — which could have actually prompted a more vulnerable individual, such as a depressive, to perhaps take drastic measures — should leave us all shaken and troubled.

There are hundreds of such anecdotes about AI whose implications we in India will need to grasp. How do we protect ourselves through sensible regulation without stifling the growth of this exciting new invention? AI is reshaping industries, economies, and geopolitics, transcending national borders with data, algorithms, and innovations flowing seamlessly across regions. In this interconnected landscape, effective governance and safety mechanisms require a unified international approach. For India, participating in global standard-setting on AI safety is not just an opportunity but an imperative. But, India has not even established a national AI safety institute.

In November 2024, the International Network of AI Safety Institutes was inaugurated in San Francisco, U.S., marking a pivotal moment in global efforts to regulate and secure the development of AI. Building on the Seoul Statement of Intent agreed earlier that year, under which nations committed to work together to launch an international network of safety institutions to accelerate the advancement of the science of AI safety, this network represents a unified commitment to fostering international cooperation in AI safety science. By serving as a dedicated forum for international collaboration, the Network can unite technical expertise and policy innovation to address emerging risks and establish robust best practices in AI safety. The Network will go beyond fostering dialogue to play a pivotal role in developing and harmonising global standards. India, so far, is sadly absent from this vital forum.

### The borderless nature of AI

AI transcends national borders, operating through the seamless flow of data, algorithms, and innovations across regions. Its global sweep means none of us is immune from its impact. Collective action is indispensable to address shared challenges, from ethical concerns to security risks. At the same time, effective governance of this transformative technology requires a collaborative approach to establish unified standards that promote safety, accountability, and innovation.

India’s participation in such global discussions is not just desirable but essential. As one of the world’s fastest adopters of AI, with an adoption rate of 30%, significantly higher than the global average of 26%, according to a recent Boston Consulting Group (BCG) report, India stands at the forefront of leveraging AI for transformative change across sectors such as health care, finance, agriculture, and logistics. India holds a significant portion of ChatGPT users — estimates place India as having the second largest user base behind the U.S., with around 10% of global ChatGPT users from India. A recent survey ranked India first among the percentage of consumers using ChatGPT. Clearly, we are major adopters of AI.

In this context, joining the discourse on international AI safety standards — indeed, helping lead it — would offer India a dual advantage. First, we must ensure that India’s AI ecosystem remains secure, ethical, and globally competitive. Second, it is in our national interest to position India as a responsible technology leader on the world stage, committed to safeguarding individual rights and advancing AI responsibly. Collaborative efforts with other nations on a multilateral level will enable India to anticipate emerging threats, adapt to regulatory shifts, and maintain its competitive edge in the global AI race. To do this, India needs to create a national institution urgently, and pitch it into the fray.

### The intersection of politics and technology

The intersection of AI and geopolitics is becoming ever more pronounced, as seen in recent proposals by the U.S. to impose export controls on advanced AI software. Such measures, while rooted in American national security concerns about China, have the potential to reshape the global technology landscape, disrupting international scientific collaborations and altering the dynamics of innovation. India is the “non-China” for now, but there is no guarantee it will be exempt from such controls indefinitely. Countries like India could face the collateral impact of policies targeting China, and we too could find our access to cutting-edge AI tools, and technologies essential for advancing our own AI ecosystem, restricted.

It is clear we cannot afford to remain a passive observer in this shifting landscape. These developments further underscore the urgency of participating in international platforms such as the International Network of AI Safety Institutes — to advocate balanced frameworks that protect legitimate security interests while preserving the spirit of collaboration.

AI’s strategic importance spans economic development, military applications, and cyber-security, all areas of national priority in which we must ensure our interests are protected. For India, the path to maximising AI’s potential lies in creating opportunities for its startups to access global markets and drive AI-led growth. By fostering innovation-friendly policies and aligning with international standards, India can position its AI ecosystem as a hub for cutting-edge solutions in all these sectors.

Proactive engagement in global AI safety initiatives will further enhance India’s ability to shape equitable frameworks that support global collaboration and transparency. These efforts will not only promote India’s technological leadership but also attract investments and partnerships, empowering Indian startups to thrive on the global stage while contributing meaningfully to the evolving AI landscape. Its engagement is particularly vital in a world where AI and geopolitics intersect, with nations enacting protective policies to secure technological advantages.

### Leveraging India’s strengths

India’s vibrant AI ecosystem, fuelled by its robust IT sector and talent pool, makes it a critical player in the global AI dialogue. Moreover, India’s experience in navigating the complexities of Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) initiatives such as Aadhaar and the Unified Payments Interface have demonstrated how inclusive, interoperable, and scalable systems can transform lives, enabling economic growth and social inclusion at unprecedented levels.

These successes of our “Tech Stack” highlight India’s ability to navigate the complexities of large-scale technological implementation while ensuring accessibility and equity. Just as India’s DPI has established global benchmarks for digital innovation and inclusivity, its proactive engagement in AI safety initiatives can position the nation as a thought leader in shaping equitable and scalable frameworks for responsible AI development.

In a world where AI is increasingly at the centre of economic and geopolitical strategies, India must take an active role in shaping its future. As the adage goes, in global politics, you are either at the table, or on the menu. Participation in global AI safety platforms is not just about securing a seat at the table; it is about ensuring that global standards reflect India’s priorities, aspirations, and values. By engaging proactively, India can protect its interests, foster cross-border innovation, and position itself as a global leader in AI governance.

The stakes are high, and the time to act is now. For India, embracing this responsibility is essential to navigating the opportunities and challenges of the AI revolution while ensuring a secure, inclusive, and prosperous future for all.

> India is emerging as a key player in global AI, leveraging its **$250 billion IT industry** and **5 million programmers**. With **AI services projected at $17 billion by 2027**, the government has invested **$1.2 billion** to boost **computing power, startups, AI education, and model development**. **Global collaborations** like Nvidia’s Hindi AI model highlight India's linguistic diversity focus. To amplify its global AI presence, India must **strengthen research, foster public-private partnerships, and develop localized AI solutions**.
