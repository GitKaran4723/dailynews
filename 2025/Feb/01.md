# Economic Survey

Chief Economic Adviser Ananth Nageswaran has pitched for a larger role for the private sector, driven by increased deregulation, in his strategy to improve domestic economic growth, as laid out in the Economic Survey.

The document tabled in Parliament on Friday noted that while the labour share of GVA (gross value added) shows a slight uptick, the disproportionate rise in corporate profits — predominantly among large firms — raises concern about income inequality. A higher profit share and stagnant wage growth risk are slowing the economy by curbing demand, it pointed out.To secure long-term stability, a fair and reasonable distribution of income between capital and labour is imperative, it suggested. The Survey advocates for fostering an enabling labour regulations environment that supports business growth, creates employment and promotes economic development.

India’s equity market has rapidly grown particularly after the pandemic, but its debt market remains undercapitalised, according to the Economic Survey. “If liquidity has to enter corporate bond markets, problems such as entry costs, information asymmetry, and the absence of a secondary market must be addressed,” the Survey pointed out.

With a large part of the household savings heading to the stock market and increasingly retail investors taking charge at Dalal Street, excessivefinancialisation can hurt the economy and the costs may be particularly high for a low-middle-income country like India, the Economic Survey has cautioned. “One critical risk to guard against is the dominance of financial markets in shaping policy and macroeconomic outcomes, a phenomenon known as ‘financialisation’,” it flagged. “The consequences of financialisation are evident in advanced economies, where it has led to unprecedented levels of public and private sector debt — some visible to regulators and some not,” it stated.

India must harness its “best resources, advanced technologies, and expertise” to become a developed nation by 2047 while ensuring a low-carbon pathway. However, it shouldn’t shut its coal-fired plants “without adequate alternatives”, the Economic Survey noted.
“The energy transitions witnessed till the last century were driven by commercial interests rather than the will to limit the emissions from advanced economies. Commercial interests and energy security remain the most significant factors in the transition pathway even today,” the document underscored. The Survey cited the example of France that embarked on nuclear power expansion in the 1970s on the back of embargos by oil-producing countries.

Overexposure to social media, lack of exercise, not spending enough time with one’s family and overwork (hours exceeding 55-60 per week) have all worsened mental well-being among Indians, said the Economic Survey 2024-25,Hostile work cultures and excessive hours spent working at the desk can adversely affect mental well-being and ultimately put the brakes on the pace of economic growth, states the Survey while highlighting that lifestyle choices, workplace culture and family situations are critical for productivity.

The Economic Survey 2024–25 struck an upbeat tone on the implications that Artificial Intelligence (AI) could have on the workforce. In defiance of the concern that AI could replace some jobs, particularly in the information technology sector, the Survey says that appropriate skilling would allow Indians “to stay one step ahead of technological developments,” and that harnessing AI “would minimise or even eliminate the potential adverse impact on employment and, if possible, turn it into a force for augmenting employment.”

Micro, Small and Medium-scale Enterprises (MSMEs) that employ 23.24 crore people in the country continue to face challenges in the regulatory environment, the Economic Survey noted. “Regulatory compliance burden holds back formalisation and labour productivity, limits employment growth, chokes innovation and depresses growth,” it said. MSMEs create a large number of jobs at relatively low capital costs and hence play a crucial role, second only to agriculture. They drive economic growth, employment generation, and innovation. Yet, there is an “observed tendency for firms in India to remain small”. So, they lose access to institutional capital, skilled talent, and technology infusion and often operate outside the formal supply chains. This creates a parallel, informal economy and contributes to low labour productivity, the Survey noted. “The logic for staying small often is to remain under the regulatory radar and steer clear of the rules and labour and safety laws. Ironically, the biggest casualties are employment generation and labour welfare, which most regulations were originally designed to encourage and protect, respectively,” the Survey said. The efforts of the government in the last 10 years focused on improving access for the MSMEs to finance, enhancing technological capabilities, providing market linkages, and addressing structural challenges. In a move to formalise the informal micro enterprises, the government in collaboration with SIDBI, introduced the Udyam Assist Platform (UAP) in 2023. More than 2.39 crore informal micro enterprises have been formalised through the platform.

Pointing towards a decrease in regular jobs and shift towards casual employment, the Economic Survey tabled in Parliament on Friday found that the proportion of self-employed workers in the workforce has risen from 52.2% in 2017-18 to 58.4% in 2023-24. “This shift reflects growing entrepreneurial activity and a preference for flexible work arrangements,” the Survey claimed. It added that the agriculture sector still remains dominant in employment, with its share rising from 44.1% in 2017-18 to 46.1% in 2023-24.

here had been a consistent increase in Female Labour Force Participation Rate (FLFPR) over the past seven years driven largely by a rise in women entering workforce in rural India, the Economic Survey for 2024-25 said.

It said this increase in FLFPR was the primary driver behind overall improvement in the labour market indicators. The FLFPR had risen over the past seven years from 23.3% in 2017-18 to 41.7% in 2023-24, the survey said.

> The **Economic Survey 2024-25** highlights **India’s strong economic fundamentals** while acknowledging global and domestic challenges. It projects **6.4% GDP growth** for FY25 and emphasizes **investment in infrastructure, monetary stability, regulatory reforms, and environmental sustainability**.

# In historic move, Karnataka allows dignified death for the terminally ill

Euthanasia, derived from the Greek words "eu" (good) and "thanatos" (death), refers to the practice of intentionally ending a person's life to alleviate suffering. It is a topic that intersects ethics, law, medicine, and human rights, leading to diverse perspectives and legal frameworks worldwide.

**Types of Euthanasia:**

1. **Active Euthanasia:** This involves directly causing the death of a patient through actions such as administering a lethal injection. Active euthanasia is illegal in India. 

2. **Passive Euthanasia:** This entails withholding or withdrawing medical treatments that prolong life, allowing the patient to die naturally. Passive euthanasia is legal in India under specific circumstances. 

**Euthanasia in India:**

In India, the legal stance on euthanasia has evolved over time, primarily through judicial pronouncements.

- **Aruna Shanbaug Case (2011):** Aruna Shanbaug, a nurse, was in a persistent vegetative state for 42 years following a brutal assault. In 2011, the Supreme Court of India addressed a petition seeking permission for passive euthanasia on her behalf. The court rejected the plea but laid down guidelines for passive euthanasia, allowing it under strict conditions with court approval. 

- **Common Cause Case (2018):** In a landmark judgment, the Supreme Court recognized the right to die with dignity as a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution. The court legalized passive euthanasia and permitted individuals to draft a "living will," specifying their wishes regarding end-of-life medical care in case they become incapacitated. 

**Recent Developments:**

In a historic move, Karnataka became the first state in India to implement the Supreme Court's directive on the right to die with dignity. The state's health and family welfare minister, Dinesh Gundu Rao, clarified that this decision pertains to patients on life support systems who are non-responsive to life-sustaining treatments and should not be confused with active euthanasia.

**Ethical and Legal Considerations:**

The debate over euthanasia encompasses several ethical and legal issues:

- **Autonomy:** Advocates argue that individuals should have the right to choose a dignified death, especially in cases of terminal illness and unbearable suffering.

- **Sanctity of Life:** Opponents contend that life is inherently valuable, and intentionally ending it undermines this principle.

- **Slippery Slope:** There is concern that legalizing euthanasia could lead to non-voluntary or involuntary euthanasia, especially among vulnerable populations.

- **Palliative Care:** Some suggest that improving palliative care services can alleviate suffering without resorting to euthanasia.

**Global Perspective:**

Globally, euthanasia laws vary:

- **Legalized Active Euthanasia:** Countries like the Netherlands, Belgium, and Canada have legalized active euthanasia under strict conditions.

- **Legalized Passive Euthanasia:** Many countries, including India, permit passive euthanasia, allowing withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments in specific scenarios.

- **Prohibition:** In several nations, both active and passive euthanasia remain illegal due to cultural, religious, or ethical reasons.

**Conclusion:**

Euthanasia remains a complex and sensitive issue, balancing individual rights, ethical principles, and societal values. India's legal framework permits passive euthanasia under stringent guidelines, reflecting a cautious approach to the right to die with dignity. Ongoing discussions continue to shape the ethical and legal landscape surrounding end-of-life decisions.

> Euthanasia, meaning "good death," involves intentionally ending life to alleviate suffering. It is classified into **active euthanasia** (direct action like lethal injection) and **passive euthanasia** (withholding life-sustaining treatment). In India, **passive euthanasia** was legalized by the **Supreme Court in 2018**, allowing individuals to draft **living wills**. Karnataka recently became the first state to implement this ruling, ensuring the **right to die with dignity**. Ethical debates include **autonomy, sanctity of life, and the slippery slope argument**. While countries like **Netherlands and Canada allow active euthanasia**, India and many others restrict it to **passive euthanasia** under strict regulations.
