# A move that endangers the right to vote
---

## **Aadhaar-Voter ID Linkage: Democratic Risk or Electoral Reform?**

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

- **Aadhaar**: A 12-digit biometric-based unique identification number issued by UIDAI. It is *not proof of citizenship*—only proof of residence.
- **Voter ID (EPIC)**: The Election Photo Identity Card issued to Indian citizens to enable participation in elections.
- **Form 6B**: A form introduced to collect Aadhaar numbers from voters for “voluntary” linkage with Voter IDs.
- **UIDAI**: A statutory authority under the Aadhaar Act, 2016, responsible for Aadhaar management.
- **ECI**: A constitutional body under Article 324 responsible for conducting free and fair elections.

### 2. **The News**

- **What**: The Election Commission of India is again pushing to **link Aadhaar with voter IDs** to remove duplicates and improve roll integrity.
- **Issue**: Critics warn this move could **violate constitutional rights**, **lead to mass disenfranchisement**, and **enable surveillance-based electoral manipulation**.
- **Legal Concerns**: Despite ECI's 2023 assurance to the Supreme Court that Aadhaar linkage is voluntary, the current process lacks a **genuine opt-out** and requires **in-person justification** for refusal.
- **Past Incident**: In 2015, a similar drive led to the **wrongful deletion of 55 lakh voters** in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.
- **Latest Warnings**: Risk of **profiling, privacy violations**, and **dependency on an unreliable Aadhaar database** with duplicated entries and no robust verification for residency.

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

- **Aadhaar Act, 2016**:
  - *Section 9*: Aadhaar is not proof of citizenship.
  - *Section 7*: Limits Aadhaar usage to welfare schemes funded by the Consolidated Fund of India.
  - *Section 50*: Allows the government to control UIDAI operations, undermining its independence.

- **Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023**:
  - Grants **broad exemptions to the government** from privacy obligations, raising fears of **political misuse of data**.

- **Supreme Court Judgments**:
  - *K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India (2018)*: Upheld Aadhaar with restrictions; emphasized **privacy as a fundamental right**.
  - *Lal Babu Hussein v. ERO (1995)*: Held that deletion of voter names must follow **principles of natural justice**.

- **Electoral Practices**:
  - *NERPAP (2015)*: Previous Aadhaar-Voter linkage attempt suspended due to voter deletions.
  - **Current Status**: Over **66 crore Aadhaar numbers** already seeded into the voter database.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### a. **Issues and Challenges**
- **Constitutional Violation**: Risks violating the **right to vote**, a constitutional right derived from democratic participation.
- **Exclusion of Marginalized Groups**: Burdens **migrants**, **elderly**, **disabled**, and **remote communities**.
- **Legal Overreach**: Aadhaar Act does not authorize its use for electoral authentication.
- **Coercion & Lack of Transparency**: “Voluntary” linkage operates with **no clear opt-out**, undermining consent.
- **Surveillance & Profiling Risk**: Electoral data could be **cross-referenced**, leading to **political targeting**.

#### b. **Impact on Society & Polity**
- **Trust Erosion**: Diminishes faith in ECI’s neutrality and democratic mechanisms.
- **Democratic Integrity**: Undermines **universal suffrage** and threatens **free and fair elections**.
- **Federal Tensions**: Raises conflict over the **centre’s control of UIDAI** and ECI's independence.

#### c. **Ethical and Governance Concerns**
- **Consent and Privacy**: Aadhaar-voter ID linkage violates **data minimization** and **purpose limitation principles**.
- **Executive Overreach**: Subverts checks and balances by empowering UIDAI beyond its constitutional mandate.

### 5. **Way Forward**

- **Drop Mandatory or Coercive Linkage**: Withdraw proposals that impose Aadhaar as a mandatory requirement for voting.
- **Uphold Privacy and Consent**: Introduce robust privacy safeguards aligned with the **Puttaswamy ruling**.
- **Strengthen Traditional Verification**:
  - Door-to-door verification by **Booth Level Officers (BLOs)**.
  - Public audits of electoral rolls.
  - Enhanced grievance redressal mechanisms.
- **Establish an Independent Redressal Body**: To handle disputes over deletions or errors in electoral rolls.
- **Legislative Clarity**: Enact clear laws defining permissible uses of Aadhaar with **judicial oversight** and **public consultation**.
