# T.N. notifies 10 Acts after SC deems assent implicit 
### 1. **Basic Understanding**

- **Legislative Assent in India**: In India's constitutional framework, once a Bill is passed by a State Legislature, it usually requires the **Governor’s assent** to become an Act. In some cases, the Governor can reserve the Bill for the **President’s consideration** under Article 200 and Article 201.
- **Re-adoption of Bills**: When a Bill is returned or withheld, the State Legislature may re-adopt it. However, this typically still needs formal assent.
- **Supreme Court Verdict (2024)**: In a recent landmark case, the **Supreme Court ruled that if the Governor unduly delays assent**, the Bill may be **deemed to have received assent**, especially if re-adopted and pending before the President.
- **Vice-Chancellors’ Appointment**: Traditionally, in many States, the **Governor acts as the Chancellor** of state universities and appoints Vice-Chancellors. This has often led to power tussles between elected governments and Governors.

---

### 2. **The News**

- On **April 13, 2025**, the **Tamil Nadu government notified 10 Acts** in the **Government Gazette**.
- These Acts became **law without assent from the President or Governor**, relying instead on the **Supreme Court’s 2024 verdict**.
- The Bills were re-adopted by the State Assembly and previously sent to the President by the Governor.
- Chief Minister **M.K. Stalin** and DMK MP **P. Wilson** hailed this as a historic move, shifting power over university governance from the Governor to the elected State Government.
- These laws primarily **empower the State Government** to appoint **Vice-Chancellors** in public universities.

# Caste census report: OBC reservation proposed to be hiked from 32% to 51%

![Categorywise quota](https://epaper.thehindu.com/ccidist-ws/th/th_bangalore/issues/127800/OPS/Public/GM2E88SGB.1%2BGV9E8ASO5.1.png?rev=undefined)

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

- **Caste Census**: A survey that collects socio-economic and caste-based data to assess the actual demographic and developmental status of different communities.
- **OBC Reservation**: In Karnataka, Other Backward Classes (OBCs) currently have 32% reservation in education and employment. This is now proposed to increase to 51%.
- **Total Reservation Cap**: The Supreme Court had earlier set a **50% cap** on reservations (Indra Sawhney judgment, 1992). However, states like Tamil Nadu (69%) and now Karnataka (proposed 85%) have exceeded it, invoking **extraordinary circumstances**.
- **Creamy Layer**: This concept excludes the 'advanced' section of OBCs from reservation benefits based on income or other socio-economic criteria. The Karnataka proposal includes its application even to **Category 1**, which was earlier exempt.

---

### 2. **The News**

- On **April 12, 2025**, the **Karnataka government accepted** the **Socio-Economic and Educational Survey** (also called **caste census**).
- The survey proposes to:
  - **Increase OBC reservation** from **32% to 51%**
  - Raise **total reservation** in the state to **85%**
  - Apply **creamy layer restrictions** across **all categories**, including previously exempt Category 1
  - Add a **new category (1-A)** for **nomadic and most backward castes**, with **6% reservation**
  - **Reclassify communities**, shifting some from 2-A to 1-A
  - Reserve seats for **orphan children** in 1-A
- The **OBC population** is reported to be **around 70%** of Karnataka’s total population.
- The number of categories will increase from **five to six**, by dividing **Category 1 into 1-A and 1-B**.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

- **Legal Context**:
  - *Indra Sawhney (1992)*: Supreme Court capped total reservation at **50%**, with some exceptions.
  - *EWS Reservation (2019)*: 10% additional quota for **Economically Weaker Sections**, pushing total reservation beyond 50% in some states.
- **Karnataka-Specific Actions**:
  - Previously initiated the **Social and Educational Survey** (2015), now accepted in 2025.
  - Earlier governments avoided releasing this caste data, citing sensitivity and potential political implications.
  - The current government is proposing **constitutional and legal pathways** to implement these new quotas.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### a) **Issues and Challenges**
- **Constitutionality**: Whether 85% reservation violates the **Supreme Court's 50% cap**.
- **Social Justice vs. Meritocracy**: Debate over expanding reservation vs. concerns about erosion of merit-based systems.
- **Creamy Layer Inclusion**: Applying it to all categories may bring **pushback from politically influential groups**.
- **Categorization Confusion**: Moving castes between categories may trigger **demands for revalidation and protests**.

#### b) **Impact**
- **Social**: Could empower historically marginalized communities, especially nomadic and orphan children.
- **Political**: Likely to become a **major electoral issue** in Karnataka and influence national discourse on caste-based reservations.
- **Legal**: Might invite **judicial scrutiny**, especially regarding breaching the 50% cap.

#### c) **Ethical and Governance Concerns**
- **Transparency**: Releasing caste data is a step toward **evidence-based policymaking**.
- **Equity vs. Equality**: Striking a balance between **social justice and inclusive development** is crucial.
- **Governance Challenge**: Managing category shifts and new entitlements will require **robust administrative mechanisms**.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

# Long-lost species of velvet worm rediscovered after 111 years
A team of researchers at the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and The Environment (ATREE) had reported rediscovering a long-lost species of the velvet worms (phylum Onychophora), one of the oldest living fossils in the world, after 111 years.

Named **Typhloperipatus williamsoni**, the ancient species — estimated to be around 220 million years old — was spotted by the team in the Siang Valley in Arunachal Pradesh and the rediscovery was published in the Journal of Natural History. The study provides the first molecular data for the species.

# India votes in favour of first global carbon tax on shipping
### 1. **Basic Understanding**

- **International Maritime Organization (IMO)**: A UN agency responsible for regulating shipping. It sets safety, environmental, and efficiency standards for the maritime industry.
- **Carbon Tax**: A fee imposed on the burning of carbon-based fuels (coal, oil, gas). In this context, it means taxing ships based on their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
- **Decarbonisation of Shipping**: Ships primarily use heavy fuel oil, which is carbon-intensive. A carbon tax aims to incentivize a shift to **lower-emission fuels**, like LNG, ammonia, or hydrogen-based fuels.
- **Climate Finance**: Financial flows to help developing countries mitigate and adapt to climate change. This tax does **not contribute to broader climate finance**, but stays within the maritime sector.

---

### 2. **The News**

- On **April 12, 2025**, the **IMO approved a global carbon tax** on shipping emissions, to begin in **2028**.
- **India and 62 other nations** (including China, Brazil) voted in favor. The **U.S. abstained**, while **Saudi Arabia, Russia, UAE**, and others opposed.
- The tax could raise **$40 billion by 2030** and is expected to **reduce shipping emissions by only 10%**, though the IMO’s target is **at least 20%**.
- **Criticism**:
  - **Small island and developing nations** (e.g., Tuvalu) demanded part of the revenue for **climate adaptation**, but the tax revenue is ring-fenced for the shipping sector only.
  - Concerns raised about **transparency** and limited progress toward cleaner fuels.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

- **India’s Support**: Aligns with India’s **climate commitments** under the **Paris Agreement** and **Panchamrit targets** (Net Zero by 2070).
- **IMO Strategy**: Updated 2023 strategy aims for **net-zero emissions by 2050**. This tax is one of the first global steps in that direction.
- **Global Precedents**:
  - The **EU Emissions Trading System** (ETS) already includes maritime emissions for ships entering EU ports.
  - The **Paris Agreement (Article 6)** promotes international cooperation on carbon pricing and markets.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### a) **Issues and Challenges**
- **Global Equity**: The tax design **excludes climate finance** for vulnerable nations, despite shipping’s global nature.
- **Technological Readiness**: Lack of affordable, scalable low-emission shipping technologies hampers effective transition.
- **Ineffective Emission Reduction**: Projected 10% cut in emissions falls short of IMO’s own target (≥20%).

#### b) **Impact**
- **Positive**:
  - Creates **financial incentive** for shipping firms to adopt greener technologies.
  - Sets a **precedent for global carbon taxation** beyond national borders.
- **Negative**:
  - May raise **shipping costs**, indirectly affecting global trade and food prices.
