# SC pulls up T.N. Governor, sets deadline to clear Bills
### 1. **Basic Understanding**

- **Article 200 of the Indian Constitution**: It outlines the powers of a Governor when a Bill is passed by the state legislature. The Governor can:
  1. Give assent,
  2. Withhold assent,
  3. Reserve the Bill for the President's consideration.

- **Pocket Veto**: Informally refers to a situation where no action is taken on a Bill, effectively stalling it without rejection or assent. The Constitution doesn’t explicitly mention this, but prolonged inaction can amount to a **pocket veto**, which is unconstitutional.

- **Governor's Role**: As per the Constitution, the Governor is a constitutional head and is expected to act on the advice of the elected state government, unless reserving a Bill for the President due to specific constitutional concerns.

### 2. **The News**

- **What Happened**: The Supreme Court criticized Tamil Nadu Governor R.N. Ravi for delaying action on 10 Bills passed by the Tamil Nadu Assembly.
- **When**: Judgment delivered on Tuesday (April 9, 2025).
- **Where**: Supreme Court of India.
- **Who was Involved**: Governor R.N. Ravi, the Tamil Nadu State Government, and the Supreme Court Bench led by Justices J.B. Pardiwala and R. Mahadevan.

- **Key Decision**: The court deemed that the 10 Bills had effectively received assent due to undue delay. It invalidated President Droupadi Murmu’s selective actions on the Bills (assenting one, rejecting seven, ignoring two), calling them void.
- **New Guidelines**: Governors must act on Bills within **1 to 3 months**.
