# The Beijing India Report as milestone and opportunity
### 1. **Basic Understanding**

- **Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action (1995)**: A global roadmap for achieving gender equality across 12 key areas such as education, health, violence against women, economic participation, and decision-making.
- **Gender and Climate Nexus**: Women, especially in rural areas, are more vulnerable to the effects of climate change due to unequal access to resources, healthcare, decision-making, and employment opportunities.
- **Gig Economy and Climate Migration**: Migration driven by climate change affects education, healthcare, livelihoods, and results in social vulnerabilities, particularly for girls and women.

---

### 2. **The News**

- **Occasion**: 30 years since the **Beijing Declaration**, India’s **Beijing+30 Report** is under review.
- **Concern**: The report inadequately addresses the **gender-climate connection**, missing an opportunity for integrated policy reforms.
- **Voices from Ground**: Women from **Kanker, Chhattisgarh**, highlight how **climate-induced migration and resource stress** are forcing girls to drop out of school and suffer from increased unpaid work, malnutrition, and health risks.
- **Findings**:
  - Climate stress leads to a rise in **gender-based violence**.
  - **Unpaid care work** (water, fuel collection) increases.
  - Women face **health issues**, including anaemia and reproductive complications.
  - Climate policies currently focus heavily on tech and energy, **excluding gender priorities**.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

- **National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC)** and **State Action Plans (SAPCC)** exist, but lack robust gender integration.

- **Schemes with partial relevance**:
  - **Beti Bachao Beti Padhao**, **NRLM**, and **MGNREGA** (with gender emphasis)
- **Gap**: Climate budgeting remains gender-blind, and women are not adequately involved in decision-making processes or climate finance.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### **Issues & Challenges**
- **Gender Invisibility in Climate Policy**: Women’s roles in agriculture, resource management, and adaptation go unrecognized.
- **Rising Unpaid Work**: Climate-related water and energy shortages increase domestic burdens.
- **Climate-Induced Violence**: Direct correlation between **temperature rise and gender-based violence**.
- **Health Deprivation**: Malnutrition and anaemia among rural women worsened by climate-linked food insecurity.
- **Lack of Disaggregated Data**: Absence of gender-segregated climate data hinders effective policymaking.

#### **Impacts**
- **Social**: Reinforces patriarchal structures; impacts education and health of girls.
- **Economic**: Loss in non-farm income (~33%), food production drops due to poor access to agricultural inputs for women.
- **Environmental**: Missed opportunity to harness women’s traditional ecological knowledge.
- **Governance**: Climate planning without gender focus results in ineffective adaptation.

#### **Ethical & Governance Concerns**
- **Justice**: Failure to integrate gender threatens constitutional guarantees (Article 14, 15, 21).
- **Participation Gap**: Violation of democratic and participatory governance principles.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

#### **Policy-Level Reforms**
- **Gender-Responsive Climate Policies**: Integrate climate indicators in the **NAPCC/SAPCC** with gender disaggregated data and budgeting.
- **Welfare Schemes Linkages**: Tie health, livelihood, and safety schemes directly to climate vulnerability.

#### **Institutional Strengthening**

- Recognize and scale up **women’s traditional knowledge systems** in seed saving, soil conservation, etc.

#### **Data, Research & Monitoring**
- Launch a **Gender & Climate Observatory** to track progress.
- Commission **climate-gender impact assessments** at national/state levels.

#### **Collaborative Action**
