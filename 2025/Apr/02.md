# Tackling the disinformation threat in India
The World Economic Forum’s (WEF) Global Risks Report 2025 underscores misinformation and disinformation as the highest ranked short-term global threat. The WEF defines “global risk” as an event that can adversely affect a sizeable portion of the population, the global GDP, and natural resources. The rapid rise of AI-generated content, algorithmic biases, and deep societal divides are making it harder than ever to separate facts from deception.

## Information disorder

India, poised to surpass 900 million Internet users, would find itself vulnerable without proper policy implementation to combat disinformation, with its diverse political and social landscape creating fertile ground for manipulated narratives, voter influence, and economic disruption. The crisis isn’t just political; it fuels consumer boycotts, economic conflicts, and international tensions. Adding to the chaos, public trust in legacy media is dwindling, and both political actors and non-state entities are exploiting this gap to push propaganda. With trust in mainstream media declining, citizens are relying more on social media for news. This shift has resulted in a significant number of users forwarding unverified information, often believing it to be accurate simply because it comes from friends or family. With former U.S. President Joe Biden’s warning of an emerging “tech oligarchy”, the world’s largest democracy shouldn’t wait any further to come up with important policy changes such as the European Union’s Digital Services Act to combat Disinformation and Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference (FIMI).

With prominent politicians and national parties’ social media accounts actively sharing deep fakes and unverified information, India is grappling with an escalating information disorder. As a rising global power, India has faced persistent Chinese disinformation threats since the 2017 Doklam standoff, prompting the ban of over 300 Chinese apps, including TikTok, to curb foreign interference. A study by the Indian School of Business and the CyberPeace Foundation reveals that political disinformation accounts for 46%, followed by general issues (33.6%) and religious content (16.8%). Platforms such as Weibo, operating within China, have been actively trying to propagate a distorted image of India. The risks could escalate if Meta ends fact-checking partnerships, as seen in the U.S. The youth dividend of India is facing a growing threat from false information, as a survey report revealed. The Global Risks Report 2025 perceives that people in high-income countries are more concerned about disinformation risks in the coming years than those in lower-income nations with some exceptions. If Indian citizens fail to recognise how disinformation deepens political and societal divides, the consequences could be severe for the democratic and social fabric.

## Recommended measures

The Global Risks Report 2025 recommends measures such as upskilling developers working with algorithms, improving public awareness and digital literacy, and ensuring accountability through supervisory boards and AI councils to oversee Generative AI practices. Initiatives like Shakti – India Election Fact-Checking Collective, and the Deepfake Analysis Unit, played a role in tackling disinformation during the 2024 general elections. With almost 400 million Facebook and over 500 million WhatsApp users, India stands as the largest market for social media platforms. By capitalising on this market power, regulatory bodies can push big tech towards positive policy changes to tackle disinformation, such as audits and transparency actions for Very Large Online Platforms with more than 45 million users, similar to the EU’s Digital Services Act. However, caution is needed, as there is a risk that ill-intentions could also escalate surveillance, potentially compromising democratic safeguards, with both censorship and surveillance highlighted as global risks in the WEF report. Platforms should be mandated with regular risk assessment. Adequate funding should be allocated for advancing cybersecurity research and innovation. Transparent content moderation policies must be implemented to address misleading content that threatens public health, safety, or democracy, with strict enforcement of non-discrimination rules. Online ads must disclose funding sources and target audiences to prevent malicious actors from spreading false narratives. Expanding public awareness initiatives, such as the Reserve Bank of India’s Financial Literacy Campaign with Amitabh Bachchan, is essential for fostering critical thinking and societal resilience. Collaboration among civil society groups, fact-checkers, and regulators is crucial to create evidence-based policies for information integrity. A support system for independent research on disinformation and FIMI is necessary, along with stronger laws to protect journalists. With the global nature of disinformation, cross-border coalitions must be established for a coordinated global response.

This challenge goes beyond technology; it is a test of our shared democratic values and threatens our collective ability to uphold truth, unity, and equality. As the world’s largest democracy, India must set an example of diversity and resilience in a growingly polarised global digital world. The real question isn’t just about fighting falsehoods, but also about ensuring that we safeguard our unity in diversity.

# House panel suggests raising creamy layer limit from ₹8 lakh
This is a **very important and timely issue**, especially for UPSC Mains preparation under topics like **Social Justice**, **Governance**, and **Welfare Policies**. Let’s break it down first, then I’ll give you a reasoned opinion on whether **raising the creamy layer limit is really worth it**:

---

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

**Key Concepts:**
- **OBC (Other Backward Classes)**: Socially and educationally disadvantaged communities recognized by the government for affirmative action through reservation.
- **Creamy Layer**: A term introduced by the **Indra Sawhney Judgment (1992)** to **exclude the more economically advanced** members of OBCs from availing reservation benefits.
- **Income Limit**: Currently set at **₹8 lakh per annum (as of 2017)**, families earning above this are considered ‘creamy layer’ and **not eligible** for OBC reservations.

**Why It Matters**:
- This income ceiling determines **who gets access to OBC reservations in education and jobs**.
- If it’s too low, **many deserving but not rich families are excluded** from benefits.

---

### 2. **The News**

- The **Parliamentary Committee on the Welfare of OBCs**, chaired by **BJP MP Ganesh Singh**, has recommended:
  - Raising the **₹8 lakh creamy layer limit**, calling it outdated and too low.
  - Consulting stakeholders to **set a “substantially higher” limit**.
  - Ensuring **uniform criteria across states**.
  - Making **job quota data public** for transparency.
- The demand comes after years of stagnation since the last revision in 2017.
- The committee also criticized the **lack of publicly available data** from the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT).

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

- **Indra Sawhney Case (1992)**: Laid down the 50% cap on reservations and the idea of the creamy layer to **exclude the "forward among backward"**.
- **Reservation for OBCs**: 27% in central government jobs and educational institutions (excluding creamy layer).
- **DoPT Portal (RRCPS)**: Designed to monitor reservation data — but access is limited to ministries.
- **Income Threshold Changes**:
  - 1993: ₹1 lakh
  - 2004: ₹2.5 lakh
  - 2008: ₹4.5 lakh
  - 2013: ₹6 lakh
  - 2017: ₹8 lakh

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### **Issues and Challenges**
- **₹8 lakh limit is outdated**: With inflation and rising cost of living, it no longer reflects economic advancement.
- **Uneven criteria across states**: Creates **confusion and inequality**.
- **Data opacity**: Lack of public access to reservation implementation data raises **accountability concerns**.
- **Backwardness vs economic rise**: Families earning ₹8–12 lakh may still face **caste-based discrimination**, especially in rural India.

#### **Impacts**
- **Social justice dilution** if deserving candidates are excluded due to an arbitrary income cap.
- **Public resentment** if the rich exploit the reservation meant for the truly disadvantaged.
- **Erosion of trust** in the reservation system if there is **lack of transparency and consistency**.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Revise the Creamy Layer Limit**:
   - Use **inflation-adjusted**, **region-specific** thresholds based on cost of living and rural-urban disparities.
   - Consider a **tiered reservation structure** within OBCs to prioritize the most backward.

2. **Uniform Guidelines**:
   - Centre and States must **harmonize creamy layer criteria**, including how income is calculated (e.g., agriculture income, salary vs business income).

3. **Improve Transparency**:
   - Make the **RRCPS portal data public**. Transparency builds **trust and ensures fair implementation**.

4. **Regular Updates**:
   - Automatically revise the income limit every **3-5 years** based on inflation and national income trends.

5. **Use Socio-Educational Indicators**:
   - Combine **income with social and educational backwardness** (e.g., first-generation learners, rural background) to better assess who needs support.

---

### ✅ **Is it really worth it to raise the creamy layer limit?**

**Yes — but with safeguards.**

- **Raising it is necessary**, as ₹8 lakh today doesn’t mean the same as it did in 2017.
- But raising it blindly may **benefit the relatively privileged** among OBCs, pushing out the truly disadvantaged.
- The solution is to **update it scientifically**, monitor **actual benefit reach**, and ensure that the **most backward among OBCs don’t get left behind**.

# Why India needs to clean its air
India’s air pollution crisis is not just a seasonal inconvenience. It’s a persistent, silent pandemic that chokes our lungs every winter and quietly lingers throughout the year. Hospitals overflow with respiratory cases, schools shut down, cities disappear under layers of smog, and Indian metros regularly top global pollution rankings.

Given the scale of this crisis, it’s worth asking: what is India actually doing to clean its air? While initiatives like the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), Bharat VI, the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), and targeted efforts to phase out coal-burning industries in the National Capital Region mark important progress, the national response remains fragmented and slow-moving. Without stronger alignment and faster implementation, transformative change may remain out of reach.

## Tuning in to ground realities

The challenge begins with how India understands air pollution. It’s often seen as a technical problem when in reality it’s a complex structural issue shaped by governance capacity, demographic pressure, socio-economic disparity, behavioural norms, and entrenched economic systems. Scientists play a vital role in diagnosing air quality — like physicians identifying symptoms — but lasting solutions depend on those working on the ground: municipal officers, planners, engineers, and community leaders. These actors operate within tight budgets, outdated infrastructure, and competing local demands. Strengthening their capacity and aligning mandates with air quality goals is essential for sustained change.

This complexity becomes especially relevant when considering India’s goal to reduce PM2.5 levels by 2026 to 40% of what it was in 2017. While ambitious and necessary, the target risks falling short if it isn’t mindful of on-ground realities. Consider transportation, for instance. It’s not enough to say “vehicles cause pollution.” We need to ask: what types of vehicles are on the road? What fuel do they use? How old are they? How far do they travel? How bad is traffic? Without this level of detail, it’s difficult to craft realistic, actionable plans for local governments. To turn national goals into real progress, we must connect them to the everyday activities that actually drive emissions.

## Proactive programs

While China is often called a success story, it came at a steep price — ₹22 lakh crore over five years for urban centres. India’s NCAP budget is less than 1% of that. However, if we include allied programs like PMUY (₹18,128 crore), the program for Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles in India or Fame II (₹10,795 crore), Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban (₹1.4 lakh crore), and NCAP itself (₹11,542 crore), a broader ecosystem of air quality financing becomes apparent. They target emission sources and deserve recognition as part of India’s clean air strategy.

The NCAP continues to struggle with how its funds are allocated and how progress is measured. It relies heavily on ambient air quality data, which is often affected by weather and geography, making short-term improvements hard to detect. For example, initiatives like PMUY and waste-burning controls have reduced emissions in several areas, but these gains may not reflect in pollution readings, creating a misleading sense of stagnation. Shifting to activity-based metrics — such as the number of stoves replaced or diesel buses retired — would offer a clearer picture of impact and strengthen accountability.

Realigning metrics alone isn’t enough. Local governments also need access to high-resolution, open-source data on emissions-generating activities: where waste is burned, which households use solid fuels, where construction is active, and which roads face the heaviest traffic. Without such data, air pollution remains an abstract issue, disconnected from daily governance. This data gap directly affects how NCAP funds are used. Between 2019 and 2023, only 60% of the funds released were utilised, reflecting not a lack of intent but institutional misalignment. Air quality continues to be treated as a parallel concern rather than a core municipal function.

To shift from intent to impact, India needs a phased, data-driven approach. Phase I: build local emissions profiles to identify the biggest pollution sources; Phase II: link funding directly to targeted actions based on that data; and Phase III: track reductions in emissions, not just pollution concentrations, to measure real progress. This shift from passive monitoring to proactive management mirrors how meaningful change happens on the ground.

## Guarding against optics

However, as India adopts more digital tools, it must avoid falling into the “Western trap”— overreliance on high-tech, urban-centric data and solutions without addressing basic pollution sources. Smog towers, real-time apportionment, and AI dashboards may appear innovative but offer little value if burning biomass and the use of old industrial processes and polluting vehicles go unchecked. Cities like London and Los Angeles rolled out advanced sophisticated technologies only after decades of systemic reform. India must sequence its strategies correctly.

This misalignment also risks elite capture. Urban hubs may get cutting-edge tools while rural and informal sectors — responsible for a large share of emissions — are neglected. Worse, these tools may distract from structural reforms, shifting attention to optics over outcomes. More data does not equal more action if local agencies lack authority or the resources to use it.

A key fix is distinguishing between academic research and solution-focused implementation. While long-term innovation is important, policymakers need short-term, scalable models they can act on. India must create separate funding streams: one for research and another for immediate, on-ground interventions. Otherwise, we risk producing more papers than progress.

## What are other countries doing?

Global examples offer guidance without imitation. China closed coal plants. Brazil used community-led waste systems. California reinvested pollution revenue in poor communities. London banned coal-use before launching sensors. Each succeeded by following a path grounded in its context. India must do the same— innovate programmes which are federalism-friendly, subsidy-driven, and tailored to its informal economy.

Ultimately, India’s clean air future will be shaped not by dashboards but by people, partnerships, and purpose. We must fix the plumbing before painting the walls. Clean air must be a right for all, not a privilege for a few. Securing that right will take more than promises. It will take coordination, courage, and a commitment to act.
