# NEP 2020 in the classroom, from policy to practice
The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 frames the universal acquisition of Foundational Literacy and Numeracy (FLN) as an urgent national mission. Since the release of the policy, the central and State governments have put in enormous efforts into programmes intended to meet the goal of ensuring that every child acquires FLN by Class two, the end of the newly designated ‘foundational stage’ of education for three to eight year olds.

Findings from the nationwide Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2024 survey that was released recently provide some indicators of the percolation of these policy pushes to individual schools. For example, more than 80% of the 15,728 rural schools across the country that were visited as a part of the survey reported having received a directive from the government to implement FLN activities for Classes one to three. In over 75% of these schools, at least one teacher had received in-person training on FLN.

## There is an awareness

A deep dive into 24 Class two classrooms in eight States earlier this year provided glimpses of how these changes are translating into practice on the ground. The first conclusion that was clear from observations of the teaching practice of these teachers, and subsequent conversations with them, is that the rationale for why FLN is important appears to have been communicated clearly and on scale.

In the eight States and in most of the schools that the writers of this article visited, teachers articulated this new focus and, for the most part, approved of it. Aspects of the new approach that required attitudinal shifts rather than new pedagogical practices were visible in their classrooms.

However, the challenges and opportunities facing teachers vary substantially, depending on the local context. For example, a classroom that comprises a large number of Class two students with limited space to move about requires a different approach than one with students from several different grades sitting outdoors. Several teachers said that they have limited opportunities to identify and discuss these challenges during training workshops. Creating spaces for practice, discussion and adaptation may be the key to increasing uptake.

## Support for teachers

Consequently, post-training support systems to teachers are of vital importance. Here, States differ markedly in the amount and the type of support that they provide. In some States, the teachers we spoke to were unable to name any form of support available to them post training. In others, trainers were available to be consulted if teachers wished to do so. In still others, regular “monitoring” visits from officials ensured that the focus on FLN was not lost, but the focus was on compliance with data collection protocols rather than teaching-learning in the classroom. In just a couple of cases, teachers spoke about block- or district-level officials actually demonstrating how to do a particular activity in the classroom.

Without the space to practise and then adapt the new methods and materials as needed, teachers are often unable to make full use of the guidelines and materials provided to them. For example, even though the focus on using teaching-learning materials (TLM) in the classroom was clear to all the teachers, in every case where some form of TLM was observed, it was evident in ‘demonstration’ mode — meaning that in all but one case it was the teacher using the TLM, and not the students. Getting TLM into students’ hands requires more thought and flexibility, very often about practical, rather than pedagogical, questions. For example, in States where teachers are given funds to make their own TLM rather than provided with ready-to-use kits, teachers were worried about the material getting damaged (torn or broken) as they would have to remake them. Others had no space to store TLM in the classroom, while the rest who had been provided with TLM kits were unclear about how and when to use them.

## Issue of syllabus completion

Perhaps, most crucially, decisions on what and how to teach are still based primarily on syllabus completion. At the State level, continuous and comprehensive evaluation (CCE) often takes the form of formative and summative assessments of curriculum content, conducted in traditional pen-and-paper format. Although teachers in several States talked about monthly FLN-specific assessments, almost none spoke about using FLN assessment results to inform their classroom practice. Resolving the inherent contradiction between ensuring universal FLN and syllabus completion is a question that the system has yet to reckon with in a systematic way.

There is little doubt that some things have changed for the better since the rollout of National Initiative for Proficiency in Reading with Understanding and Numeracy (NIPUN) Bharat — the mission that lays out detailed guidelines on how FLN goals should be met on the ground and adaptations across the country. The clear focus on FLN and its resultant visibility in schools and among teachers, is in itself a step forward. This is reflected in the fact that for the first time since the ASER survey began 20 years ago, learning levels at the foundational stage have improved across the country, a change mostly driven by government schools. This focus must be maintained in the years ahead to ensure that all children in India acquire these basic skills.

# Why are tensions high in the Arctic?
International observers have raised concerns about escalating tensions in the Arctic, warning that if left unchecked, they could eventually spark conflict in the region.

![Arctic Council](https://lotusarise.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Arctic-council-members.jpeg)

## What is happening?

The Arctic, the northernmost area of the planet, has remained largely isolated for centuries. However, as climate change accelerates the melting of ice caps, new strategic opportunities are emerging for global powers. Beneath the frozen landscape lie untapped reserves of natural resources such as fossil fuels, rare earth elements, phosphates, and copper as well as lucrative fishing grounds.

Most of these resources are currently inaccessible due to the year-round ice barrier, but as climate change destroys the Arctic environment, these resources and nearby trade routes will become increasingly viable. Unlike the Antarctic, which is demilitarised and environmentallyprotected by a dedicated international treaty, the Arctic lacks similar legal safeguards and is primarily governed by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). This allows nations to claim territories in the region and deploy military infrastructure. In recent years, overlapping maritime claims and military posturing have exacerbated tensions.

## Who is in control?

The various islands and coastal areas in the Arctic are controlled by eight countries — Canada, Denmark (through Greenland), Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the U.S. Together, these nations form the Arctic Council, an international body tasked with protecting the environment, conducting scientific research, and safeguarding the interests of indigenous peoples in the region. These nations exercise sovereignty over the Arctic land and can also exploit resources within their Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs). The waters between these territories fall under international jurisdiction, ensuring freedom of navigation.

According to UNCLOS, nations can extend their claims to the seabed beyond the 200-nautical-mile EEZ if they can prove that the area is a natural prolongation of their continental shelf. Canada, Denmark, and Russia have all submitted overlapping claims to the Arctic seabed to the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf. Despite these territorial declarations, infrastructure in the Arctic remains underdeveloped, with only a few operational ports along the coast. Among the Arctic Council members, Russia is the only country with a significant fleet of icebreakers, including one which is nuclear-powered, capable of navigating through the region’s treacherous sea ice.

## Where do the tensions arise?

For months, news headlines have reported on U.S. President Donald Trump’s renewed interest in acquiring Greenland from Denmark. He has described the world’s largest island as a matter of “ national security” and has questioned the legitimacy of Denmark’s sovereignty over the territory. Greenland, which has been under Danish control for over 300 years, also hosts the U.S. Pituffik military base. In January, following Mr. Trump’s renewed interest, Denmark’s prime minster Mette Frederiksen has pledged to bolster Greenland’s security and embarked on a tour of European capitals to seek support from allies.

Additionally, tensions between the U.S. and Canada have risen following Mr. Trump’s controversial comments about annexing Canada. Both nations have long disputed the status of the Northwest Passage, a potential Arctic shipping route that winds through Canada’s Arctic Archipelago. Ottawa considers the passage part of its internal waters, granting it control over navigation, while Washington insists it falls under international jurisdiction, which means that any nation has freedom of navigation in the Passage.

Concerns over potential conflict also extend to Russia and the remaining Arctic Council members. These members, apart from Russia, all belong to NATO. Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, relations within the Council have become increasingly strained. Russian officials, including Defence Committee of State Duma member Andrei Gurulyov, have suggested that Norway’s Arctic island of Svalbard should fall under Russian control. Meanwhile, observer states of the Arctic Council, including India, are closely monitoring developments. The U.K., for instance, has repeatedly emphasised the strategic importance of the Greenland-Iceland-U.K. (GIUK) gap, a critical choke point for NATO’s naval defences. This passage is the only feasible route for Russian submarines attempting to access the Atlantic to potentially disrupt NATO shipping in case of conflict, making it a focal point of Western military planning.

## Why does the Arctic matter so much?

Aside from ongoing resource extraction, interest in the Arctic surged following a 2009 U.S. Geological Survey report estimating that the region holds 13% of the world’s undiscovered oil reserves and 30% of its untapped natural gas reserves. Most of these resources lie beneath the seabed, making maritime claims highly significant. Greenland also harbours some of the world’s richest deposits of rare earth elements, which drew significant investment interest from Chinese companies in the early 2020s. However, many of these projects were later suspended due to environmental concerns or U.S. political pressure.

The melting of Arctic sea ice has also prompted interest into the opening of new commercial trade routes. The Northeast Passage, which runs along Russia’s Arctic coast, is particularly critical for Chinese trade. This route, stretching from the Bering Strait to Norway, could reduce the maritime distance between East Asia and Europe by approximately 8,000 kilometres compared to the traditional route through the Suez Canal. Navigating commercial shipping through this passage could save Beijing billions in transportation costs. However, the so-called Polar Silk Road would require Russia to grant Chinese ships access to its Arctic ports, a prospect Moscow has so far approached with caution.

## What lies ahead?

Aside from political declarations and territorial claims, some nations have taken concrete steps to assert their Arctic ambitions. In 2007, Russia sent the MIR-1 submarine to the North Pole to plant a Russian flag on the seabed beneath the Arctic ice cap — a symbolic demonstration of its presence and capabilities. Moscow has also maintained a number of military bases in the Arctic, most of them dating back to the Soviet era. In 2022, it conducted joint naval exercises with Beijing in the East China Sea, which indicated strategic implications for Arctic security.

China has also steadily become more vocal about its Arctic interests, declaring itself a ‘Near-Arctic State’ in 2018 and planning the construction of its first nuclear-powered icebreaker. Since Sweden and Finland joined NATO following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the alliance has intensified its military presence in the region, including large-scale exercises near the Russian border in Finland in 2024. Analysts have pointed out NATO’s limited operational capabilities in the Arctic, raising concerns about strategic imbalances. As temperatures continue to rise, tensions in the melting Arctic may soon reach a boiling point.
