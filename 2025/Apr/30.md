1. ## **UN Chief Calls for Dialogue Amid India-Pakistan Tensions**

---

### **1\. Basic Understanding**

The India-Pakistan relationship has long been marked by hostility, especially regarding Kashmir and cross-border terrorism. The United Nations (UN), particularly through its Secretary-General, occasionally intervenes diplomatically to urge restraint and facilitate dialogue during periods of heightened tension. The Right of Reply is a procedural right in the UN allowing countries to respond to statements made by others during debates.

---

### **2\. The News**

Following the recent **terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir**, tensions escalated between India and Pakistan. **UN Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres**, through his spokesperson, expressed **deep concern** and urged both countries to **exercise restraint**, avoid further escalation, and engage in **dialogue** to resolve issues peacefully.

In parallel, **India exercised its Right of Reply at the UN**, where **Ambassador Yojna Patel**, Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN, sharply criticized **Pakistan** for supporting terrorism. She cited Pakistan‚Äôs own Defence Minister‚Äôs admissions and labeled Pakistan a ‚Äú**rogue State**‚Äù destabilizing the region and misusing UN platforms for propaganda.

* **Victims of Terrorism Association Network (VoTAN)**: A recent initiative to support victims globally.

* **India-Pakistan Tensions**: Ongoing since partition in 1947; major flashpoints include the 1947, 1965, and 1971 wars, and the 1999 Kargil conflict.

* **UN Charter Articles**:

  * *Article 1*: UN purpose includes promoting peaceful settlement of disputes.

  * *Article 2(4)*: Refrain from threat or use of force.

---

### **4\. Mains Relevance**

The episode underscores **persistent structural challenges** in South Asia's regional diplomacy. Pakistan‚Äôs continued **support for non-state actors**, and India's global campaign to isolate Pakistan diplomatically, have rendered bilateral dialogue difficult. The **UN‚Äôs cautious role** reflects its limited leverage in bilateral disputes where one party (India) asserts it as an internal matter. However, **internationalization of Kashmir** through such statements and platforms like VoTAN signals a potential **shift in global attention** toward accountability for state-sponsored terrorism.

**Governance Concerns**: India rightly points out misuse of multilateral forums by Pakistan. However, India's engagement with international institutions remains vital to uphold its diplomatic narrative and counter false equivalence.

---

### **5\. Way Forward**

India must maintain its **firm stance against terrorism** while continuing **multilateral engagement** to expose duplicity in global forums. Strategic communication, alongside **bilateral engagements with allies**, will be key to cornering state sponsors of terror. At the same time, a **measured response** that avoids escalation should be preferred, as emphasized by the UN Secretary-General.

2. ##  **Supreme Court on Pegasus Spyware Use for National Security**

---

### **1\. Basic Understanding**

**Pegasus** is a military-grade spyware developed by the Israeli company NSO Group. It is capable of infiltrating smartphones without user knowledge and extracting information, recording calls, and remotely accessing the device. Globally, its alleged misuse triggered debates about **privacy rights vs. national security**.  
 In India, the Supreme Court had earlier appointed a **technical committee** to investigate whether Pegasus was used to surveil Indian citizens, including journalists, activists, and politicians. The core constitutional issue involves **Article 21** (Right to Privacy) vs. **State's Responsibility for National Security**.

---

### **2\. The News**

During a hearing on petitions related to the Pegasus spyware case, the **Supreme Court Bench led by Justice Surya Kant** questioned whether the government‚Äôs use of Pegasus against "anti-national elements" would inherently be wrong, provided national security was at stake.

* **Petitioners**, represented by senior advocates like **Kapil Sibal**, **Shyam Divan**, and **Dinesh Dwivedi**, sought disclosure of the findings of the court-appointed **technical committee** that had conducted forensic analysis on submitted phones.

* **Solicitor General Tushar Mehta** agreed that **terrorists have no right to privacy**.

* The Court emphasized that although **privacy is fundamental**, it cannot compromise **national security**.

* The Bench was open to informing individuals whether their phones were hacked, without disclosing sensitive national security details.

* The Court refused to fully disclose reports unless it was ensured that national sovereignty would not be harmed.

The matter is now listed for **further hearing on July 30**.

---

### **4\. Mains Relevance**

The Pegasus case exemplifies the **delicate balance** between **national security imperatives** and **citizen rights**. While the State has a legitimate responsibility to protect its people, surveillance must be **lawful, necessary, and proportionate**. Unchecked state surveillance risks leading to a **surveillance state**, undermining democratic freedoms, judicial independence, and citizen trust.  
 Additionally, the Court‚Äôs cautious approach reflects the **challenges of dealing with cybersecurity and digital rights** in an era of rising terrorism and transnational threats. It also highlights concerns over **secrecy in judicial proceedings** through the use of **sealed covers**, which can affect transparency.

Ethical questions emerge around:

* Consent and autonomy of individuals

### **4\. Mains Relevance**

#### ***Issues & Challenges*****:**

* **Erosion of Civil Liberties**: PTA allows prolonged detention, denial of bail, and legitimizes **torture and forced confessions**.

* **Selective Application**: Used disproportionately against **ethnic and religious minorities**, dissenters, and journalists.

* **Democratic Backsliding**: PTA undermines Sri Lanka‚Äôs claims of democratic governance and judicial fairness.

* **Resistance to Repeal**: The **security establishment‚Äôs hold** on the law prevents governments from acting, despite public or political consensus.
