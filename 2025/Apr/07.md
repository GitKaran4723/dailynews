# Kaliyattam nights
### 1. **Basic Understanding**

**Theyyam** is a ritualistic performance art form popular in northern Kerala, especially in the districts of Kannur and Kasaragod.  
- It combines **dance, music, and mime**, and performers are considered to be possessed by the **spirit of a deity or ancestor** they represent.
- **Kathiranur Veeran** is one of the many Theyyam forms (each Theyyam has a unique backstory, often linked to local deities, heroes, or myths).
- **Kaliyattam** is the festival during which Theyyam is performed. It takes place in **Kaavus** (sacred groves/temples).
- **Chulayadu Aduvapuram Vyail Kavu** is one such sacred location in Kannur where this ritual is celebrated.
- The **Theyyam season** runs from **October to May/June**, coinciding with post-harvest periods, when communities have time to engage in spiritual and cultural activities.

---

### 2. **The News**

- The **Kathiranur Veeran Theyyam** was performed at the **Chulayadu Aduvapuram Vyail Kavu Kaliyattam** festival in **Kannur, Kerala**, on **Sunday**.
- This performance is part of the vibrant **Theyyam season** in **northern Kerala**, which lasts from **October to May/June** each year.
- The event saw community participation and traditional reverence, marking the continuation of Kerala’s rich ritualistic heritage.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

- **Kerala Folklore Academy** (under the Department of Culture) actively documents, promotes, and supports Theyyam and other folk traditions.
- The **Ministry of Culture (GoI)** has schemes like:
  - **Scheme for Safeguarding Intangible Cultural Heritage**.
  - **Financial Assistance for Promotion of Art and Culture**.
- **UNESCO** has frameworks for safeguarding intangible heritage, under which India promotes traditional art forms (Theyyam is on the list of potential candidates for international recognition).
- Inclusion of Theyyam in **school curricula and cultural exchange programs** has also been encouraged.

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

**Issues and Challenges:**
- **Commercialization** and **loss of spiritual depth** due to tourism.
- **Neglect of performer welfare**—many Theyyam artists come from marginalized communities.
- **Erosion of traditional knowledge**, especially as younger generations shift away.

**Impacts:**
- **Society**: Reinforces communal harmony and caste reconciliation during performances.
- **Culture**: Preserves local history, myths, and rituals.
- **Economy**: Boosts local tourism, but may lead to exploitation if not regulated.
- **Governance**: Challenges in balancing preservation and modern development.

**Ethical/Governance Concerns:**
- **Representation of Dalit performers**—historically, Theyyam performers belong to oppressed castes and represent resistance and empowerment.
- Need for **dignified recognition** beyond religious boundaries.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

- **Recognize Theyyam as an Intangible Cultural Heritage** under UNESCO to ensure global protection.
- Provide **social security and pension schemes** for aging Theyyam performers.

# Prescribe preventive medicine for a healthy India
India stands at the cusp of economic glory, aspiring to become a $5 trillion economy and a global powerhouse. However, there is a “silent epidemic” of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) that threatens our economic and developmental ambitions. Today, NCDs are the leading cause of death in the country, accounting for roughly two-thirds of all deaths. To secure a healthy and prosperous future, India must urgently embrace a preventive health-care mindset — one that can heal before there is a need to heal.

## The rising tide of NCDs, economic tool

Over the past few decades, India has undergone an epidemiological transition. Communicable diseases such as infections have come under control but have been overtaken by NCDs. Chronic conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, cancers, chronic lung diseases, and stroke kill an estimated five million to six million Indians each year. What is particularly alarming is that NCDs are striking Indians at younger ages.

India’s working-age population is increasingly affected — a disturbing trend when its GDP target relies on the youthful demographic dividend. In fact, 22% of Indians over 30 years are at risk of dying from an NCD before they hit the age of 70. We see this mirror in our hospitals every month with 30- to 40-year olds with heart ailments or in need of dialysis due to diabetic complications.

Beyond the human cost, the economic impact of NCDs is staggering due to the resulting loss of productivity and reduced workforce participation. Studies estimate that NCDs may already be costing India around 5%-10% of its GDP. A World Economic Forum (and Harvard School of Public Health) study projected that between 2012 and 2030, NCDs would inflict a loss of around $3.5 trillion–$4 trillion on the Indian economy. Hence, an investment in preventive health care is not an expense but an economic strategy. Prevention is our best insurance policy for sustainable development.

The good news is that most NCDs are largely preventable. Sedentary lifestyles, unhealthy diets, tobacco and alcohol use, pollution, and genetic predisposition are some of the key culprits. By modifying these, we can significantly reduce NCD risk. It is estimated that about 80% of premature heart disease, stroke, and diabetes cases can be prevented by addressing lifestyle factors.

Today, around 22%-23% of adults are overweight, and there is an urgent need to tackle obesity. We must make physical activity a part of one’s daily routine with at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise a day, be it in the form of walking, yoga, or sports. A healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and proteins, and lower in sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats is a must.

Air pollution is a health emergency directly impacting rates of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer, and even heart attacks. We must view pollution control as part of preventive medicine.

Finally, the most important measure is regular health screenings. Detecting these conditions early, through screenings starting at the age of 40 years or earlier if there is family history, can literally be a lifesaver. Early detection means timely intervention — controlling blood pressure before it causes a stroke, or removing a precancerous polyp before it turns into colon cancer. Screening such as mammograms for breast cancer or HPV tests for cervical cancer can find early, curable stages of disease.

## Technology can transform prevention

Digital health technology — from smartphone apps and wearables to big data analytics — is a game changer. India has over 750 million smartphone users, which means we have the ability to deliver health advice, reminders, and risk assessments in the palm of everyone’s hand. Wearable devices and health trackers allow individuals to keep an eye on their health stats. The integration of such real-time data into preventive care plans is an exciting new frontier.

Most transformative is the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in predictive health modelling. AI algorithms can analyse vast datasets to predict an individual’s risk for various NCDs with remarkable accuracy. AI tools can analyse an individual’s profile and generate a “health risk score” that forecasts the likelihood of, say, a cardiac event or developing diabetes over the next decade. AI also helps in early diagnostics — for instance, machine learning models can scan chest X-rays or computed tomography (CT) scans to detect early lung nodules or early signs of fatty liver that a human might miss, enabling pre-emptive action.

However, preventive medicine, augmented by AI, should always remain humane, compassionate, and patient-centric. Used responsibly, digital health and AI will be our greatest allies in making preventive care more proactive, precise, and accessible.

## Fostering a preventive mindset

Preventive medicine is not just a set of services but a mindset. I envision a future where every individual, community, corporate and government thinks “health-first” in every action and policy. Individuals must become the champions of their own health. I urge every reader to schedule that check-up you have been postponing and make small daily changes such as taking the stairs or cutting down on sugar to protect your well-being. Corporates and workplaces play a pivotal role by investing in employee wellness programmes — from annual health checks to in-house counsellors and fitness sessions.

Health-care providers must pivot from a reactive cure model to a preventive care model. The government’s role is extremely important and initiatives such as the National Programme for Prevention and Control of NCDs and the establishment of Health and Wellness Centres that focus on screening and prevention are stellar steps. Beyond this, public policies should also be health-oriented: urban planning should create green spaces for exercise; education curricula should include health and nutrition, and food industry regulations should encourage reduced salt and sugar.

In the years that I have striven to make preventive care accessible and impactful, I have seen thousands of lives transformed because a disease was caught early or a risk factor was managed in time. Every individual has the power to make choices that guard their health. And those choices, scaled across 1.4 billion Indians, can help define our nation’s health and happiness and ensure we reach our economic goals too.

# Health and sanitation as the pillars of a healthy India
On this World Health Day (April 7), as nations reflect on the foundations of human well-being, India stands tall with a transformative lesson: health and sanitation are not separate pursuits, but are two sides of a coin. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India has undertaken a sanitation and water revolution that has not only changed the way we live but also how we thrive.

## Rural missions that made a difference

The story of modern India cannot be told without acknowledging the contribution of the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) Grameen and the Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM). These programmes are not just about toilets and tap water alone. They represent a shift in the soul of the nation. These rural missions symbolise dignity, equity, and, above all, health.

When the Prime Minister launched the SBM from the ramparts of the Red Fort in 2014, he ignited a movement that has touched every Indian household, making it a people’s movement — a Jan Andolan that was anchored in behavioural change and inter-generational equity. By 2019, India had declared itself Open Defecation Free (ODF) and taken significant steps towards achieving SDG 6.2 (it focuses on achieving access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all by 2030) and also ending open defecation, 11 years ahead of time.

The SBM has been a powerful public health intervention. A World Health Organization (WHO) report estimated from 2014 to 2019, through the sanitation mission, over three lakh diarrhoeal deaths were averted. The Gates Foundation reported in 2017 that there were 58% higher cases of wasting among children in non ODF areas. A UNICEF study (2017) found that 93% of women felt safer after getting a toilet at home and ODF families saved ₹50,000 annually in health-care costs, ensuring higher savings. The SBM has improved environmental outcomes. Groundwater contamination in ODF villages is 12.7 times less likely, ensuring long-term health resilience in rural communities. A (2024) Nature study estimated that 60,000 to 70,000 child deaths are prevented every year due to improved sanitation access. These outcomes are not incidental, they are the result of sustained political commitment, inter-ministerial coordination, and community ownership.

In 2019, the Jal Jeevan Mission was launched to ensure every rural household receives clean drinking water through a tap connection. This is more than infrastructure. It is an investment in human potential with far-reaching socio-economic impact. Research by Nobel Laureate Dr. Michael Kremer has shown that nearly 30% infant deaths can be reduced if safe water is made available to families for drinking and 1.36 lakh child deaths (under five years) can be prevented with universal tap coverage. WHO estimates suggest that the JJM could avert four lakh diarrhoeal deaths with safe drinking water supply at home. And, 5.5 crore hours are saved every day, mostly by women, who had earlier spent time fetching water. State Bank of India research finds that the availability of water within premises led to increased participation by women in agriculture and allied activities.

The Sujal and Swachh Gaon campaign, launched to integrate water, sanitation, and hygiene at the village level, has further galvanised communities. Thousands of villages have already been declared Swachh Sujal, which is an important marker of holistic public health transformation. Improved water and sanitation systems are also leading to reduced out-of-pocket expenditure for rural households, reinforcing the preventive health-care model.

## On the ground

Sanitation and water are the first line of defence in public health. They are the invisible shield that protects communities from disease, women from indignity, and children from lost opportunity. A healthy nation is a productive nation. A clean nation is a resilient one.

Today, more than 80% of India’s rural households have tap water connections. Over 96% villages have been declared as ODF Plus, more than 5.07 lakh villages have solid waste management systems, and 5.23 lakh villages have liquid waste management systems in place.

Women are not just beneficiaries, they are also water testers, sanitation entrepreneurs, and local leaders. Over 2.48 million women have been trained to test water quality, and women-led Self-Help Groups are managing sanitation assets, recycling centres, and even sanitary napkin production. This is the vision of a Viksit Bharat where no child misses school because of a lack of water, no woman walks miles with a pot on her head, and no family loses a loved one to preventable illness.

The journey to health is the journey to dignity. A toilet brings privacy. Clean water brings opportunity. Waste management protects the environment. Each link in the sanitation chain connects directly to a healthier, safer society. The lessons we have learnt highlight the importance of inter-ministerial collaboration which is non-negotiable.

## It is about convergence

Since, health is not the concern of one Ministry alone, it is the outcome of converged action across water, sanitation, nutrition, education, and rural development. We must recognise that India’s model is not insular, it is global. Our innovations, community-led models, and use of technology whether through real-time dashboards, Galvanizing Organic Bio-Agro Resources Dhan (or GOBARdhan) biogas plants, or plastic waste management units are blueprints for the world, especially the Global South. Lastly, we must continue to work through a mutual understanding that every rupee invested in Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) yields manifold returns in health, productivity, gender equity, and environmental sustainability.

India is committed towards progressing forward on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and this World Health Day, we need to acknowledge and remember that good health begins not in hospitals, but in homes with access to clean water, safe sanitation, and a shared resolve. As we move forward, India remains committed to sharing its journey, collaborating globally, and co-creating a cleaner, healthier, and more resilient world.

# Can the U.S. President serve a third term?
On March 30, the 78-year-old U.S. President Donald Trump said he’s “not joking” about serving a third term in the White House. He further claimed that a legal loophole could make it possible.

## Does the U.S. Constitution allow it?

The 22nd Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, ratified on February 27, 1951, limits U.S. Presidents to two elected terms. It was brought in response to Franklin D. Roosevelt’s unprecedented ‘four-term’ Presidency (1933–1945), which broke the ‘two-term’ unwritten precedent set by the nation’s first President, George Washington, who voluntarily declined a third term in 1796.

The Amendment prohibits anyone from being elected President more than twice, and if someone has served as President for more than two years of another’s term (for example, a Vice President who became President due to the President’s death or resignation), they can only be elected once. Thus, effectively, the maximum U.S. Presidential tenure can be 10 years (two years as a successor plus two full terms). For Mr. Trump, elected in 2016 and 2024, the 22nd Amendment unequivocally bars a third term, due to his two elected tenures (2017–2021 and 2025–2029), regardless of their ‘non-consecutive’ nature.

## What is the ‘VP loophole’?

Despite the 22nd Amendment’s clarity, Mr. Trump has suggested ways to circumvent it. One idea he proposed involves J.D. Vance running for President in 2028 with Mr. Trump as Vice President (VP). If elected, Mr. Vance would resign, allowing Trump to assume the Presidency. However, the 12th Amendment blocks this strategy, stating: “No person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States.” Since the 22nd Amendment bars Mr. Trump from another term, he cannot serve as VP either.

While the VP route is blocked, another theoretical path exists through ‘succession’, as explained by Professor Bruce G. Peabody in his paper. The 22nd Amendment prohibits a person from being “elected” to the Presidency more than twice but does not bar “serving” beyond two terms. In other words, a twice-elected President could ascend to the Oval Office via the line of succession, such as by becoming Speaker of the House, who is elected by members of the House and need not himself be a member of Congress, if the President and VP become unavailable.

A third pathway — repealing the 22nd Amendment — is highly unlikely. Under Article V, this requires either a two-thirds vote in both the House and the Senate or a ‘constitutional convention’— a process never used — called for by two-thirds (34) of State legislatures, followed by ratification by three-fourths (38) of the 50 States. Given the current U.S. political landscape, the likelihood of Mr. Trump securing a constitutional amendment, which has not been done in the past 33 years, is virtually non-existent.

## Which world leaders have extended their tenure?

Leaders all over the world have skilfully extended their rule by reshaping constitutional limits. For instance, Vladimir Putin, after two terms as Russia’s President (2000-2008), hit the ‘consecutive’ two-term limit under Article 81(3) of the 1993 Constitution. To circumvent this limit, he then became Prime Minister (2008–2012) as his ally Dmitry Medvedev took the Presidency and extended the Presidential term from four to six years. Returning as President in 2012 and 2018, Mr. Putin, with a 2020 amendment backed by a loyal Duma and judiciary, reset his term count, potentially holding power until 2036.

Türkiye’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Prime Minister (2003-2014), turned President, axed term limits via a 2017 referendum, and reshaped Türkiye’s system into a Presidential one. Similarly, China’s Xi Jinping eliminated the two-term cap in 2018. This change allowed Mr. Xi to rule indefinitely, cementing his hold over the party and the State.

Yet, some leaders thrive without rewriting the rules. In Germany, where chancellors face no ‘term limits’ but need ‘Parliamentary support’, Angela Merkel ruled for 16 years. Similarly, Prime Ministers in Canada and Britain, unbound by fixed terms, can lead indefinitely, sustained by ‘party confidence’.

## Why doesn’t India have term limits?

Unlike the U.S. Presidential framework, India’s Parliamentary system imposes no term limits on its Prime Minister, as tenure depends on retaining the Lok Sabha’s confidence (Article 75(3)). This design ensures ‘voter sovereignty’, ‘democratic flexibility’, and ‘parliamentary accountability’, allowing leaders who sustain public trust to serve extended periods. For instance, current Prime Minister Narendra Modi could serve 15 years by 2029. However, the system also includes checks like the “no-confidence” motion, which has historically ended tenures — such as those of V.P. Singh (1990), H.D. Deve Gowda (1997) and Atal Bihari Vajpayee (1999). Moreover, regular elections, coalition dynamics, floor debates, judicial oversight, and a free press ensure a robust democratic balance.
