# RBI cuts repo rate by 0.25%, trims GDP growth forecast
### 1. **Basic Understanding**

- **Repo Rate**: The repo rate is the rate at which the **Reserve Bank of India (RBI)** lends short-term money to commercial banks. A reduction in this rate makes borrowing cheaper for banks, which ideally translates to **lower loan interest rates** for customers.
  
- **Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)**: A 6-member committee set up under the **RBI Act, 1934**, responsible for deciding key interest rates (like the repo rate) to achieve inflation targeting and economic growth.

- **Basis Point (bps)**: A unit of measurement for interest rates; **1 basis point = 0.01%**. So, a **25 bps cut means a 0.25% reduction**.

- **Trade War**: Economic conflict where countries impose tariffs or other trade barriers on each other, affecting global growth. In this context, the **U.S.-China trade war** initiated by President Trump's tariffs has created uncertainty in global markets.

---

### 2. **The News**

- On **Wednesday**, the **RBI** **cut the repo rate by 25 basis points**, bringing it down to **6%**.
- The **MPC voted unanimously** for the rate cut to boost economic **growth** and reduce borrowing costs for loans (home, auto, etc.).
- However, this move may **lower deposit interest rates**, affecting savers.
- This decision comes amid the backdrop of a **global trade war**.
- The **GDP growth forecast for India** has been **revised downward from 6.7% to 6.5%**.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

- **Monetary Policy Framework Agreement (2015)**: Mandates inflation targeting by the RBI, with a target of **4% (+/- 2%)** CPI inflation.
- **Flexible Inflation Targeting (FIT)**: The RBI uses repo rate adjustments as a primary tool under FIT to manage inflation and stimulate growth.
- **Recent Initiatives**:
  - RBI’s **accommodative stance** indicates readiness to cut rates further to support the economy.
  - Past rate cuts during economic slowdowns, including post-COVID measures, align with this approach.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### Issues and Challenges:
- **Growth vs. Inflation trade-off**: Lower repo rates may push growth but can stoke inflation if demand rises too quickly.
- **Transmission of Rate Cuts**: Banks do not always pass on the full benefit of rate cuts to borrowers.
- **Savers vs. Borrowers**: Reduced rates benefit borrowers but hurt fixed-income savers, especially the elderly.

#### Impacts:
- **Economy**: Boosts consumption and investment through cheaper credit.
- **Society**: Helps middle-class borrowers (home/auto loans) but may hurt depositors relying on interest income.
- **Polity**: Reflects central bank’s independence in macroeconomic stabilization amid political pressure.
- **Ethical/Governance Concerns**: Ensuring fair balance between economic classes (borrowers vs. savers), and clarity in communication by RBI.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

- **Improve Monetary Transmission**: Strengthen linkages between policy rate and bank lending rates through MCLR/external benchmarking mechanisms.
- **Monitor Inflation Closely**: Ensure rate cuts do not overshoot inflation targets, particularly food and fuel inflation.
- **Strengthen Growth Drivers**: Parallel steps in **fiscal policy** (infrastructure spending, tax reliefs) are needed to complement monetary easing.
- **Protect Small Savers**: Offer higher interest small savings schemes or floating rate bonds to cushion the impact on depositors.
- **Global Coordination**: Work with global central banks to navigate uncertainties from trade tensions and geopolitical risks.

# Legal milestone
### 1. **Basic Understanding**

- **Governor's Role**: Under **Article 154** and **Article 163** of the Indian Constitution, the Governor is the **constitutional head of a State**, expected to act on the **aid and advice** of the Council of Ministers (except in discretionary matters).

- **Assent to Bills (Article 200)**: When a State Legislature passes a Bill, the Governor has three options:
  1. Give assent.
  2. Withhold assent.
  3. Reserve the Bill for the President.

- **Re-adoption of Bills**: If the Governor returns a Bill and the State Legislature passes it again, the Governor is expected to give assent or refer it to the President promptly, not delay indefinitely.

- **Vice-Chancellors (V-Cs)**: In most states, Governors are Chancellors of state universities and traditionally appoint V-Cs, which has been a point of Centre-State friction, especially in opposition-ruled states.

---

### 2. **The News**

- The **Supreme Court** has delivered a significant judgment against **Tamil Nadu Governor R.N. Ravi** for **withholding assent and forwarding 10 re-adopted Bills to the President**, instead of acting on them as required.
- These Bills sought to **transfer the power of appointing V-Cs from the Governor to the State government**.
- The Court:
  - **Held the Governor’s actions as arbitrary and not in good faith**.
  - Reasserted that **Bills re-passed by the Assembly are deemed to have received assent** if not acted upon in a reasonable time.
  - **Laid down timelines** for Governors to act on State legislation.
- The verdict has restored the Tamil Nadu government’s power to appoint V-Cs, affecting **12 vacant university posts**.

---

- **Delimitation Commission**: Appointed by the **President of India** and works in collaboration with the **Election Commission of India (ECI)**. Its orders have **legal force and cannot be challenged in courts**.

- **Last Delimitation**: Conducted based on the **2001 Census**, but as per a constitutional amendment, **no new delimitation will occur until after 2026**, despite the 2011 Census.

- **Democracy**: Implies **equal value of votes** and **representative governance** based on population size.

- **Federalism**: Implies **power-sharing** between the **Centre and States**, respecting their autonomy and diversity.

---

### 2. **The News Context**

- With **2026 approaching**, the **freeze on Lok Sabha seat redistribution** is due to be lifted. This has triggered debates on:
  - Whether **Southern States** (with better population control) should be penalized with fewer seats.
  - Whether **Northern States** (with higher population growth) should gain disproportionately more representation.
  
- This raises **concerns over democratic equity vs federal balance**, as the **number of seats and weightage in Parliament** would shift.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Constitutional Provisions**

- **42nd Amendment (1976)**: Froze delimitation until 2001 to promote population control.

- **Political Sensitivities**: Risk of **regional alienation**, especially in Southern states (Tamil Nadu, Kerala, etc.).

- **Governance vs Representation**: Striking a balance between **incentivizing good governance** (population control) and **ensuring fair representation**.

#### Impacts:
- **Polity**: May lead to **majoritarianism** if populous states dominate legislative agenda.
- **Centre-State Relations**: Trust deficit could increase if states feel politically marginalized.
- **National Integration**: Regional disparities in political power may impact **national unity**.
- **Electoral Representation**: Can skew development priorities toward high-representation states.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

- **Incentivize Population Control**: Avoid penalizing performing states. Link seats to governance metrics, not just population.
  
- **Constitutional Safeguards**: Introduce **checks and balances** in Lok Sabha voting, perhaps through **weighted voting** or **region-wise seat caps**.

- **Strengthen Rajya Sabha’s Role**: Ensure federal interests are protected through a more empowered **Upper House**.

- **Expert Committee**: Set up a **non-partisan panel** to examine implications of delimitation on democracy and federalism before any decision.

- **Public Consultations**: Encourage **inclusive debates**, especially in Parliament and civil society.

# RBI plans market-based route to securitise bad bank assets
### 1. **Basic Understanding**

- **Stressed Assets**: Loans or advances under financial stress, which include **Non-Performing Assets (NPAs)**, **restructured loans**, and **loans under special mention accounts (SMAs)**.

- **Securitisation**: A financial process where assets (like loans) are pooled together and converted into **marketable securities**, which are then sold to investors to **raise liquidity** and **distribute risk**.
