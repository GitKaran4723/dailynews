# Ramachandra Guha on the three waves of Indian environmentalism
### 1. **Basic Understanding**

- **Environmentalism**: A social and political movement aimed at the preservation and restoration of the natural environment.
- **Industrial Revolution**: A period (18th–19th century) marked by a shift from agrarian economies to industrial manufacturing, largely powered by fossil fuels.
- **Chipko Movement**: A grassroots forest conservation movement in India (1973) where villagers hugged trees to prevent deforestation.
- **Three Waves of Environmentalism (as per Guha)**:
  - **First Wave**: Early 20th-century intellectual resistance to industrialisation in India.
  - **Second Wave**: 1970s–80s mass movements like Chipko that linked environmental justice with social movements.
  - **Third Wave**: Emerging youth-driven movements primarily in response to climate change.
- **Tropical vs Temperate Ecology**: Tropical ecosystems (like India’s) are more biodiverse but also more fragile than temperate ones (like Europe’s).

# A case for a fair seat allocation
### 1. **Basic Understanding**

- **Delimitation vs Readjustment**:
  - **Delimitation** refers to redrawing the boundaries of electoral constituencies.
  - **Readjustment** refers to **reallocation of seats** among states based on population shifts, as per **Article 82**.
- **Article 81(2)**: Mandates **equal representation** by ensuring that the ratio of population to seats is uniform across states.
- **Population Freeze**: The number of Lok Sabha seats has been frozen since **1971** by constitutional amendments (42nd and 84th), despite significant population changes. This freeze continues until **2026**.
- **Issue**: Disparity between high-population-growth northern states and low-growth southern states may lead to **political imbalance** if seats are reallocated purely based on population.

---

### 2. **The News**

- **What**: A renewed debate is taking place over **Lok Sabha seat readjustment**, often incorrectly called "delimitation", in anticipation of the **post-2026 census changes**.
- **When**: With Census 2021 delayed and 2026 approaching, discussions are intensifying in 2025.
- **Where**: Nationwide, but **southern states** (esp. **Tamil Nadu**) have taken the lead in opposing proportional seat increase based solely on population.
- **Who**: Centre (Union Government), Election Commission, Southern State CMs (especially TN CM M.K. Stalin), constitutional bodies.

**Highlights**:
- **Tamil Nadu and other southern states fear a loss of political power** in Parliament due to their successful population control measures.
- States like **Uttar Pradesh**, with uncontrolled population growth, would gain disproportionate power if Article 81 is applied as-is.
- A proposed **68% uniform increase in seats**, based on Kerala’s population growth, is being suggested as a **compromise formula**.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

- **Delimitation Acts**: Enacted in 1952, 1962, 1972, and 2002. Current freeze based on **84th Amendment Act, 2001** and **87th Amendment Act, 2003**, extending the freeze on readjustment until **after 2026**.
- **Election Commission of India**: Responsible for overseeing delimitation with Delimitation Commission.
- **Census Operations**: Conducted every 10 years under the Census Act, 1948. 2021 Census has been postponed due to COVID-19.
- **Parliament’s Role**: Will need to **enact a new Delimitation Act** post-2026 for readjustment to proceed.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### **Issues and Challenges**:

- **Federal Tension**: Southern states feel penalized for controlling population, while northern states gain more seats and thus political power.
- **Equity vs Equality**:
  - **Article 81(2)** mandates equality in seat-to-population ratio.
  - But **equity** demands not rewarding states that failed in population control.
- **Political Consequences**: North-South divide may deepen; southern states may lose influence in national policymaking.
- **Demographic Imbalance**: Disproportionate representation can distort democracy, giving more power to populous but less-developed regions.
- **Practical Limitations**: Enlarging Lok Sabha to over 900 seats (as proposed under Kerala-based 68% model) poses logistical, administrative, and legislative challenges.

#### **Impact**:

- **Political**: Shifting balance of power between regions; affects coalition-building and federal relations.
- **Social**: Risk of regional alienation and eroding trust in national unity.
- **Constitutional**: Need to reinterpret Articles 81 and 82 to reflect modern demographic realities.
- **Administrative**: Managing a huge legislature (800–900+ MPs) will need systemic reforms.

#### **Ethical and Governance Concerns**:

- **Rewarding Non-compliance**: Encouraging bad governance by granting more power to non-performing states.
- **Data-Driven Governance vs Democratic Representation**: Conflict between population realities and democratic ideals of equality.
- **Transparency**: Lack of clarity from the Union government has led to speculation and fear.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **National Consensus Building**:
   - Conduct **all-party meetings and inter-state consultations** to develop a fair formula.
   - Involve **NITI Aayog**, **Finance Commission**, and **Law Commission** for holistic input.

2. **Reform Article 81**:
   - Consider **amending Article 81(2)** to accommodate an **equity-based allocation formula** rather than strict proportionality.

3. **Population Control Incentives**:
   - Recognise and reward states that achieved demographic targets via **infrastructure grants**, **policy autonomy**, or **increased Rajya Sabha representation**.

4. **Balanced Readjustment Formula**:
   - Adopt a **blended model**: Combine **population-based representation** with **development indicators** (e.g., HDI, education levels).
   - **68% step-up model** (based on Kerala's growth) is a promising compromise.

5. **Parliamentary Reforms**:
   - If increasing LS seats significantly, revamp infrastructure, digitalise proceedings, and improve **parliamentary efficiency**.

6. **Public Awareness**:
   - Clarify the difference between **delimitation** and **readjustment** through awareness campaigns to foster informed debate.

7. **Strengthen Federalism**:
   - Reaffirm India’s **“Union of States”** principle by ensuring **equitable power-sharing** among regions, irrespective of demographic size.
