---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

- **Forest Rights Act, 2006**: Especially Clause 3.1(m), obligating the state to provide land to tribals displaced before Dec 13, 2005.
- **Bru Rehabilitation Plan (2019)**: A model where IDPs were offered either return or resettlement with state support.
- **Constitutional Provisions**:
  - **Article 342**: Defines Scheduled Tribes.
  - **Article 338A**: Establishes NCST for ST rights protection.
- **Supreme Court & High Courts**: Have offered occasional interim relief to displaced tribals (e.g., halting eviction or demolition).

However, **no specific policy exists in India for IDPs** akin to international guidelines (like the UN’s *Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement*), leading to gaps in protection and resettlement.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

**Issues & Challenges**:
- **Statelessness and Legal Identity**: Denial of ST status leads to exclusion from education, jobs, and welfare.

- **Economic**: Landlessness and denial of government benefits fuel poverty.
- **Political**: Raises questions on governance, federal cooperation, and tribal welfare commitments.
- **Security**: Ironically, many displaced tribals have joined security forces, aiding anti-Maoist efforts—highlighting their strategic importance.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **National IDP Policy**: Frame a legal framework for **rehabilitation and rights** of internally displaced persons.
2. **Inter-State Coordination**: Central government must mediate agreements for **recognizing displaced STs** across states.
3. **Implement FRA Clause 3.1(m)**: Expedite processing of applications for land titles regardless of state boundaries.
4. **Recognize Displacement History**: Officially record past displacements and include these families in **tribal development plans**.
5. **Humanitarian Support**: Provide **basic amenities, education, healthcare**, and **livelihood training**.
6. **Court-Backed Oversight**: A special committee under NCST and court observation to ensure time-bound justice.
7. **Youth Engagement**: Offer skill-building, recruitment into civil defense, and scholarships to integrate the new generation.
