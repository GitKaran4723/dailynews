# A cut in time
### 1. **Basic Understanding**

- **Repo Rate**: The rate at which the RBI lends short-term money to banks. A lower repo rate reduces borrowing costs, thus encouraging spending and investment.
- **Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)**: A 6-member RBI committee that sets benchmark interest rates to manage inflation and growth.
- **Accommodative Stance**: Indicates RBI’s willingness to cut rates further to support economic growth.

- **Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act (1930)**: A U.S. law that raised tariffs, contributing to the global Great Depression.
- **Basis Point (bps)**: One-hundredth of a percentage point. So, 25 bps = 0.25%.

---

### 2. **The News**

- On the backdrop of global economic uncertainty, the **RBI’s MPC unanimously cut the repo rate by 25 bps to 6%**, changing its policy stance to **“accommodative.”**
- The decision aims to **boost liquidity and support domestic investment** amid fears of a global slowdown due to U.S. protectionism and a possible **trade war with China.**
- **Exporters in India** are pressuring the government to secure trade deals with the U.S., as Trump’s tariff policies threaten Indian exports.
- Despite the rate cut, **GDP growth forecast has been revised downward** from 6.7% to 6.5%, signaling caution.
- The **U.S.–China trade tensions** have triggered fears reminiscent of the **1930s Great Depression**, with tariffs escalating dramatically.
  
---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### **Issues & Challenges**
- **Volatile global economic environment** due to rising protectionism and tariff wars
- **Export uncertainty** for Indian businesses due to changing U.S. trade policies
- **Limited monetary space** for further rate cuts if inflation rises
- **Transmission delays**: Rate cuts don’t always immediately reduce borrowing costs due to sluggish bank response
- **Global spillovers**: India’s exposure to global economic headwinds, like U.S. monetary tightening or Chinese demand contraction

#### **Impacts**
- **Positive**:
  - Lower interest rates can **revive domestic consumption and private investment**
  - Helps exporters reduce operational costs amid declining external demand
- **Negative**:
  - **Downward revision of GDP** may weaken investor confidence
  - **Trade wars** can disrupt global supply chains and increase uncertainty
  - **Currency volatility** and FPI outflows in response to global shifts

#### **Ethical & Governance Concerns**
- Balancing national interest vs global cooperation
- Ensuring policy predictability to avoid investor panic
- Strategic autonomy in economic diplomacy

# Are existing mechanisms effective in combating judicial corruption?
### **Are Existing Mechanisms Effective in Combating Judicial Corruption?**

---

### **1. Introduction**

Judicial corruption undermines the integrity of the legal system and erodes public trust in justice. India, while constitutionally committed to judicial independence, has witnessed concerns regarding opacity, lack of accountability, and alleged misconduct within the judiciary.

---

### **2. Existing Mechanisms to Curb Judicial Corruption**

#### **a. Internal Institutional Mechanisms**
- **In-house procedure (1997)**: Enables internal inquiry against judges of High Courts and Supreme Court. However, it lacks transparency and has no statutory backing.
- **Restatement of Values of Judicial Life (1997)**: A code of ethics for judges but is non-enforceable.

#### **b. Constitutional Provisions**
- **Impeachment under Article 124(4)**: Judges can be removed by Parliament for proved misbehavior or incapacity. However, it's rarely used and procedurally complex.

#### **c. External Oversight Mechanisms**
- **Contempt of Court Law**: Prevents public criticism of judges, but often seen as a deterrent to transparency.
- **CAG & RTI**: Limited applicability to the judiciary; asset declarations by judges are voluntary and not subject to full public scrutiny.

#### **d. Judicial Appointments and Transfers**
- **Collegium System**: Lacks transparency and is criticized for nepotism, impacting ethical standards.

---

### **3. Assessment of Effectiveness**

| **Mechanism**                        | **Effectiveness**                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| In-house procedure                  | Lacks transparency, accountability, and statutory teeth                           |
| Impeachment                         | Impractical due to political process and high burden of proof                     |
| Collegium System                    | Opaque, with limited external oversight                                           |
| Contempt Law                        | Misused to curb free speech rather than ensure accountability                     |
| RTI & Financial Disclosures         | Inconsistent application; not fully enforceable                                   |

Thus, **existing mechanisms are largely ineffective** due to **lack of transparency, enforceability, and institutional independence of oversight mechanisms**.

---

### **4. Issues and Challenges**

- **Absence of Judicial Standards Bill**: Proposed to lay down enforceable standards, but yet to be enacted.
- **Resistance to External Oversight**: Judiciary has resisted bodies like the National Judicial Commission (NJAC).
- **Fear of Undermining Judicial Independence**: Genuine, but often misused to avoid accountability.
- **Delayed Justice Delivery**: Corruption thrives in systems where delays create opportunities for manipulation.

---

### **5. Way Forward**

1. **Establish a Judicial Accountability Commission** with independent powers to investigate complaints.
2. **Codify ethical standards and declare assets compulsorily**, with public access.
3. **Reform the collegium system**: Make it more transparent and inclusive.
4. **Enact the Judicial Standards and Accountability Bill** with adequate checks and balances.
5. **Leverage technology** (e-Courts, AI in tracking case progress) to reduce human discretion and improve transparency.
6. **Strengthen Whistleblower Protection** for insiders who report unethical conduct.
7. **Public awareness and civic pressure** to ensure judicial integrity becomes a democratic demand.

---

### **6. Conclusion**

Judicial integrity is the cornerstone of a constitutional democracy. While India has mechanisms to combat corruption in the judiciary, they are largely inadequate. A **balance between judicial independence and judicial accountability** is essential to uphold the rule of law and public confidence in the justice system.
