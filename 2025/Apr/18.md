### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### a. **Issues and Challenges**
- **Limited GI Awareness**: Most rural artisans don’t benefit directly from GI recognition.
- **Market Disconnect**: No major increase in tourist inflow or market expansion post-GI.
- **Monetary Challenges**: Low wages (₹200 per sari); limited reach despite efforts.

#### b. **Impacts**
- **Cultural**: Recognition preserves centuries-old weaving traditions.
- **Economic**: Potential boost if market access, branding, and digital reach improve.
- **Legal**: GI tag gives legal protection against imitation.
- **Governance**: Highlights the need for better implementation and post-GI market linkage.

#### c. **Ethical/Governance Concerns**
- **Exploitation by Middlemen**: Without direct market access, weavers may still suffer.
- **Tokenism vs Real Benefit**: GI tags without follow-up marketing or infrastructure become symbolic.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Post-GI Strategy**: Establish GI-specific marketing units and retail outlets at district/taluk levels.
2. **Digital Empowerment**: Launch official e-commerce platforms for rural artisans.
3. **Government Procurement**: Mandate GI product use in government gifts and promotional events.

# ‘Environment Ministry must roll back order on desulphurising coal plants’
### 1. **Basic Understanding**

- **Flue Gas Desulphurisation (FGD)**: A technology used to remove **sulphur dioxide (SO₂)** from the exhaust flue gases of fossil-fuel power plants. This is important because SO₂ is a key contributor to acid rain and respiratory illnesses.
- **Sulphur Dioxide (SO₂)**: A harmful air pollutant mainly released by burning coal. High levels lead to acid rain, respiratory problems, and environmental degradation.
- **Central Electricity Authority (CEA)**: Government body monitoring the electricity sector.
- **CPCB Guidelines**: Central Pollution Control Board mandates stack heights and emission control norms.
- **Indian Coal vs Imported Coal**: Indian coal generally has **lower sulphur content (0.3–0.5%)**, while imported coal may have higher levels (>0.5%).

---

### 2. **The News**

- **What**: A study by **National Institute of Advanced Studies (NIAS)** recommends **rolling back** the **blanket FGD mandate**.
- **When**: Report commissioned recently by the **Office of the Principal Scientific Adviser**.
- **Why**:
  - **92% of Indian coal** has low sulphur.
  - Stack heights and climate conditions already mitigate SO₂ dispersion.
  - FGD installations increase **cost, CO₂ emissions, and freshwater usage**.
- **Current Status**:
  - **Only 8% compliance** as of 2024.
  - **FGD installation costs**: ₹1.2 crore/MW.
  - **230 plants** in progress, **260 plants** have not ordered FGD.
  - Deadlines extended to **2027–2029** based on category.
- **Alternative**: Restrict FGD to plants using **high sulphur or imported coal**.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

- **2015 Notification**: Mandated FGD across all 537 coal-fired plants.
- **Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC)**: Issued the notification based on global pollution control standards.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### a. **Issues and Challenges**
- **One-size-fits-all policy**: Applying FGD mandates regardless of coal quality increases inefficiency.
- **Cost Burden**: ₹1.2 crore per MW—huge financial pressure on discoms and consumers.
- **Water & Energy Consumption**: FGD units consume **freshwater and power**, straining resources and climate efforts.
- **Compliance Lags**: Only 8% plants installed FGD even after multiple extensions.

#### b. **Impacts**
- **Environment**: Blanket FGD installation reduces SO₂ but adds 69 million tonnes of CO₂ emissions.
- **Public Health**: Regions using high-sulphur coal remain at risk without targeted controls.
- **Economy**: Cost of installation and maintenance could increase power tariffs.
- **Governance**: Reflects lack of adaptive policymaking to regional conditions.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Targeted Implementation**: Mandate FGD only in plants using **imported/high sulphur coal** or located in **high-pollution zones**.
2. **Data-Driven Policy**: Update policies based on **real-time sulphur emissions data** and local air quality impact.
3. **Hybrid Solutions**: Combine FGD with **alternative SO₂ reduction strategies**, such as fuel blending and retrofitting low-sulphur tech.
4. **Economic Incentives**: Offer **viability gap funding or carbon credits** for plants that voluntarily adopt FGD.
5. **Periodic Review**: Establish an **expert review committee** to evaluate emission control technologies every 3 years.
