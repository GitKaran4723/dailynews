# Loans now cheaper as major banks cut rates
### 1. **Basic Understanding**  

- **Repo Rate**: The interest rate at which the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) lends money to commercial banks. It influences overall lending and deposit rates in the economy.
- **Basis Point**: One basis point = 0.01%. So, a 50 basis point cut = 0.50% reduction.
- **External Benchmark Lending Rate (EBLR)**: Loan rates linked to an external benchmark like the RBI’s repo rate, making them more transparent and responsive to policy changes.
- **Deposit Rate**: The interest banks offer on deposits (like savings or fixed deposits).

---

### 2. **The News**  

- Following **RBI’s 50 bps cut in repo rate in 2025**, major Indian banks have lowered both lending and deposit rates.
- **SBI**:
  - Cut repo-linked lending rate by **25 bps to 8.25%**.
  - Reduced EBLR to **8.65%** from April 15.
- **Bank of Maharashtra**:
  - Also reduced EBLR to **8.65%**.
- **Bank of India**:
  - Cut home loan rates to **7.9%** (down 25 bps).

  - Slashed deposit rates by **25 bps**:
    - Below ₹50 lakh: **2.75%**.
    - Above ₹50 lakh: **3.25%** (effective April 12).

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**  

- **Monetary Policy by RBI**:
  - Repo rate adjustments are a key tool to manage inflation and stimulate economic growth.
  - A **rate cut** encourages borrowing and investment, helping counter economic slowdown.
- **Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)**:
  - A statutory body that decides repo rate changes under the **RBI Act, 1934 (amended in 2016)**.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**  

#### Issues and Challenges:
- Balancing **inflation control vs. growth stimulation**.
- Ensuring **transmission of rate cuts** to consumers (banks sometimes delay it).
- **Impact on savers** due to lower deposit interest rates.

#### Impact on:
- **Economy**: Cheaper loans can boost consumption and investment.
- **Banking Sector**: Lower margins may impact bank profitability.
- **Households**: Lower EMIs benefit borrowers but reduce returns for depositors, especially seniors.

#### Ethical/Governance Angle:
- Transparency in linking lending rates to repo rate is a **pro-consumer reform**, ensuring fair pricing of loans.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**  

- Strengthen **monetary transmission mechanisms** to ensure full benefits reach borrowers.
- Explore **tiered deposit rates** to protect vulnerable savers like senior citizens.
