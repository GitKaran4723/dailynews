### 1. **Basic Understanding**

- **Bretton Woods System (1944)**: A global financial framework established after World War II where major currencies were pegged to the U.S. dollar, and the dollar was convertible to gold. It led to the creation of institutions like the **IMF** and **World Bank**.
- **Nixon Shock (1971)**: U.S. President Richard Nixon unilaterally suspended the dollar’s convertibility into gold, ending the Bretton Woods system. This marked the start of a floating exchange rate regime and increased financial volatility.
- **Tariffs**: Taxes imposed on imported goods. "Reciprocal tariffs" refer to imposing tariffs on countries that have already placed tariffs on U.S. goods — a protectionist trade measure.
- **Protectionism**: An economic policy of restricting imports from other countries to protect domestic industries from foreign competition.
- **Global Supply Chains**: Networks that span multiple countries for producing and distributing goods — sensitive to trade disruptions.

# A people still waiting to move out of the margins
International Transgender Day of Visibility, which is observed on March 31, highlights the challenges that transgender individuals face. Despite legal advancements such as the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, social stigma, economic exclusion and discrimination persist. There are barriers to education, employment and health care. Workplace biases and financial discrimination hinder economic empowerment, while bullying and unsupportive environments restrict education. Health-care systems fail to address transgender-specific needs, worsening marginalisation. True inclusion requires strong policy implementation, anti-discrimination enforcement, and societal change. Governments, businesses and communities must ensure financial inclusion, equal opportunities and support, fostering empowerment beyond mere visibility.

## Legal recognition vs reality

Weak implementation of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, hampers access to welfare schemes. As of December 2023, the National Portal for Transgender Persons received 24,115 identity card applications. However, only 15,800 certificates were issued, with over 3,200 pending beyond the mandated 30-day period. In Delhi, despite a transgender population of approximately 4,200 (2011 Census), only 23 identity cards had been issued by April 2022. The Act’s bureaucratic certification process delays recognition by contrasting global standards of self-determination. It also lacks provisions for addressing police harassment, family rejection, and social exclusion.

Economic empowerment remains a challenge in India due to systemic barriers in employment and entrepreneurship. A 2018 National Human Rights Commission of India (NHRC) report found that 92% of transgender individuals were excluded from economic activities, forcing many to engage in sex work. A 2022 study reported a transgender unemployment rate of 48%, far above the national average of 7%-8%.

Discrimination starts at hiring, where biases lead to exclusion, and those employed face workplace hostility, a lack of gender-neutral facilities, and resistance from colleagues. While Tata Steel has hired over 100 transgender employees, the industry-wide adoption of such policies is limited. In 2024, the Finance Ministry clarified that LGBTQ+ individuals could open joint bank accounts and nominate partners as beneficiaries, yet broader financial exclusion persists. There need to be workplace inclusion policies, diversity hiring, targeted financial programmes, and government-backed loans to ensure economic empowerment.

# Hurdles in access of Health and education

Education is crucial for inclusion and the economic empowerment of transgender individuals in India, but systemic discrimination leads to significant disparities. The 2011 Census reported a transgender literacy rate of 56.1%, when the national average was 74.04%. In Kerala, 58% dropped out due to bullying, harassment, and unsupportive environments. But some States have introduced inclusive policies — Maharashtra has transgender cells in colleges and the University of Kerala has reserved seats and hostel facilities. However, nationwide policies remain weak. Ensuring equal opportunities requires gender-sensitive curricula, inclusive learning spaces, financial aid and vocational training.

Transgender individuals in India face major health-care challenges owing to systemic discrimination, financial barriers, and inadequate medical infrastructure. Despite the National Health Policy (2017) and the Ayushman Bharat, accessibility remains limited. A National Legal Services Authority survey found that 27% were denied health care due to their gender identity. Gender-affirming treatments remain costly (between ₹2 lakh to ₹5 lakh) with limited insurance coverage. While the ‘Ayushman Bharat TG Plus’ card offers ₹5 lakh annual coverage, implementation gaps persist. The lack of trained health-care professionals results in substandard care, and mental health support is severely inadequate. Solutions include mandatory transgender health-care training; inclusion of gender-affirming treatments in insurance; dedicated transgender health clinics, and expanded mental health services.

## Steps to help mainstream

Changing societal perceptions of transgender individuals in India requires genuine inclusion in the media, education, workplaces, and policies. While visibility has increased, portrayals often reinforce stereotypes. Deep-rooted prejudices in families, schools, and workplaces are another factor. Initiatives such as the ‘I Am Also Human’ campaign by the Humsafar Trust help, but broader efforts are needed. Gender sensitisation in schools, universities, and workplaces is essential. The media must depict transgender individuals in diverse roles, while cultural events such as Tamil Nadu’s Koovagam Festival can promote acceptance.

International Transgender Day of Visibility underscores the need for policy reforms, social acceptance, and economic inclusion. Discrimination persists in employment, education, health care, and public spaces. Many face identity documentation issues, financial barriers, and workplace biases. Addressing these issues requires awareness campaigns, inclusive media representations, and gender sensitisation in schools and workplaces. Beyond symbolism, enforcing anti-discrimination laws, inclusive hiring, and supporting transgender entrepreneurs are also essential. True equality demands collective action to dismantle institutional barriers and to ensure dignity, empowerment, and integration.
