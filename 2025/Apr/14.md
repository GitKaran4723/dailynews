# A Governor’s conduct and a judgment of significance
### 1. **Basic Understanding**

- **Governor’s Role**: As per the Constitution, the Governor is the *constitutional head* of a State, acting on the **aid and advice of the Council of Ministers** (Article 163), except in a few discretionary areas.
- **Article 200**: Deals with the Governor’s options on a Bill passed by the State Legislature:
  - Assent to the Bill.
  - Withhold assent and return the Bill (if not a money bill).
  - Reserve the Bill for the President’s consideration.
- **Article 142**: Empowers the Supreme Court to pass any order necessary to do **complete justice** in a case.

---

### 2. **The News**

- These included Bills curbing the **Governor’s powers to appoint Vice-Chancellors**, which had been pending since as early as 2020.
- The Court ruled that the Governor had **no discretion** once the Bills were re-passed by the Assembly.
- Using **Article 142**, the Court **deemed the 10 Bills as assented**, overriding the Governor’s inaction.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### Issues and Challenges:

- **Misuse of gubernatorial discretion** to **stall State laws** and disrupt cooperative federalism.
- **Tensions between Union-appointed Governors and elected State governments**, especially in opposition-ruled States.
- Lack of **clear judicial remedies** when the Governor **withholds assent indefinitely**.

#### Impact on:

- **Democracy**: Upholds the **will of elected legislatures** against unelected constitutional functionaries.
- **Judiciary’s role**: Demonstrates how **Article 142** can be used to uphold constitutional governance without being seen as judicial overreach.

#### Ethical and Governance Concerns:

- Governor’s **politicization** undermines **neutrality** expected of a constitutional head.
- Delays in legislative assent **erode public trust** in democratic processes.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

# Saving traditional varieties of seeds
Here’s a **structured analysis** of the article on **saving India’s traditional seed varieties and transforming the food system**:

---

### 1. **Basic Understanding**

- **Traditional seed varieties**: Indigenous or heirloom crops cultivated over centuries — often more resilient to **droughts, floods, pests**, and **low-input conditions**.
- **Hybrid varieties**: Scientifically bred for higher yields but require **chemical inputs, irrigation**, and are often non-reproducible by farmers.
- **Agrobiodiversity**: The variety and variability of plants used in agriculture; crucial for **climate adaptation, food security**, and **nutritional health**.

---

### 2. **The News**

- India is witnessing a **rapid decline of traditional seed varieties**, especially millets, indigenous pulses, and native rice.
- The **shift towards hybrid seeds**, government policies prioritising high-yield crops, and changing **consumer preferences** are the main causes.
- A recent **consultation by MSSRF’s Tribal Agrobiodiversity Centre** in Odisha laid the groundwork for reviving indigenous crops via **community seed banks, participatory research**, and **market incentives**.
- There is growing momentum among civil society organisations, but **national-level coordinated policy and institutional support is still lacking**.

---

### 3. **Government Interventions & Initiatives**

- **Positive Examples**:
  - **Odisha Millet Mission**: Promotes millet farming with procurement and consumption support.
  - **International Year of Millets (2023)**: Raised awareness globally about traditional grains.
  - **Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY)**: Supports organic farming, including traditional seeds.

- **Gaps in Policy**:
  - Most R&D funding still prioritizes **productivity of few staple crops** (wheat, rice).
  - **MSP and procurement policies** exclude many traditional crops.
  - Lack of **community-managed seed systems** and **regional conservation centres**.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### Issues and Challenges:

- **Loss of biodiversity** due to focus on monocultures and high-yielding varieties.
- **Climate vulnerability** as modern crops are less resilient to shocks.
- **Market and policy bias** against traditional crops.
- **Weak conservation infrastructure** for storing and reviving traditional seeds.

#### Impact on:

- **Food security**: Monocultures reduce resilience to crop failure.
- **Nutrition**: Traditional crops often have higher micronutrient content.
- **Farmers’ livelihoods**: Dependency on external inputs increases debt and risk.
- **Culture**: Loss of agricultural heritage and traditional food systems.

#### Ethical/Governance Concerns:

- **Equity in agricultural support**: Marginalised farmers growing traditional crops are often neglected.
- **Knowledge justice**: Farmer knowledge and seed-saving practices go unrecognised.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**

1. **Policy Reforms**:
   - Expand **MSP and public procurement** for traditional crops.
   - Include traditional seeds in **school meals, ration shops, hospitals** to boost demand.
   - Align **crop diversification schemes** with climate adaptation strategies.

2. **Market Development**:
   - Build **processing and branding infrastructure** for millets, pulses, etc.
   - Run **consumer awareness campaigns** to boost demand for traditional grains.

3. **Community-led Conservation**:
   - Establish **regional seed banks** and **community seed networks**.
   - Recognise and support **women farmers** and indigenous communities as seed custodians.

4. **Research and Innovation**:
   - Promote **Participatory Plant Breeding (PPB)** with farmer-scientist collaboration.
   - Invest in **genetic improvement of traditional varieties** for modern conditions.

5. **Institutional Coordination**:
   - Form a **National Agrobiodiversity Mission** under NITI Aayog or MoA&FW.
   - Foster **alliances between research institutions, civil society, and market players**.

---

**Conclusion**:  
India’s food system must **pivot towards sustainability** by restoring its **traditional seed diversity**. This shift not only supports climate resilience and farmer welfare but also aligns with cultural identity and nutrition goals. It’s time for **systemic, multi-stakeholder action**, not isolated efforts.

---

### 4. **Mains Relevance**

#### Issues and Challenges:

- **Collapse of multilateralism**: Undermines **WTO principles** of non-discriminatory trade.
- **Rising protectionism**: Threatens global supply chains and export-led growth models.

- **India’s Economy**:
  - Exports to the U.S. (especially **apparel, machinery, and electronics**) could be affected.
  - Pharmaceuticals and IT services are **exempt from new tariffs** — offering a cushion.
  - Export-GDP ratio is **low (21.8%)**, so the **macro impact may be contained**, but **sectoral distress** is likely.
- **Geopolitics**:
  - Reconfiguration of **supply chains**.
  - Opportunity for India to **replace China** in some global value chains — but needs infrastructure and policy support.

#### Ethical/Strategic Concerns:

- **Weaponization of trade** for domestic political gains.
- Risk of **beggar-thy-neighbour** policies where countries act at others' expense.

---

### 5. **Way Forward**
