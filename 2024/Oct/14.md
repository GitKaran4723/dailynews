# UNIFIL - United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon

**UNIFIL (United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon)** is a peacekeeping mission established by the United Nations Security Council in 1978 through Resolution 425 and 426. The mission's initial purpose was to confirm the withdrawal of Israeli forces from southern Lebanon after their invasion, restore international peace and security, and assist the Lebanese government in regaining authority over the region.

### Key Facts about UNIFIL:

1. **Establishment**: UNIFIL was created in response to the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in **1978**, which occurred after attacks carried out by the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) based in southern Lebanon.

2. **Mandate Expansion**: 
   - In 2000, when Israel withdrew from southern Lebanon, UNIFIL helped verify the withdrawal.
   - After the 2006 Lebanon War between Hezbollah and Israel, the UN Security Council expanded UNIFIL’s mandate through Resolution 1701. Its role now includes:
     - Monitoring the cessation of hostilities.
     - Supporting the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) in establishing control over southern Lebanon.
     - Ensuring that the area between the Blue Line (border between Israel and Lebanon) as shown in the image below and the Litani River is free of unauthorized armed personnel, weapons, and equipment.
     - Facilitating humanitarian access to civilians and the voluntary and safe return of displaced persons.

3. **Forces and Contributions**: UNIFIL consists of troops from various UN member states. It includes military personnel, observers, and civilian support staff, all working to maintain peace and stability in the region.

4. **Challenges**: The mission has faced many challenges over the years, including tensions between Hezbollah (a Lebanese militant group) and Israel, rocket attacks, landmine issues, and resistance from local armed groups.

5. **Current Role**: UNIFIL continues to monitor the ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel, prevent conflicts, and provide humanitarian assistance. It also plays a critical role in demining and removing explosive devices left over from the conflict.

As of October 2024, the situation involving UNIFIL (United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon) has escalated due to increased tensions along the Israel-Lebanon border. Several incidents have occurred, notably involving clashes between Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) and UNIFIL personnel.

1. **Incidents Involving IDF**: On October 13, 2024, Israeli Merkava tanks breached a UNIFIL position in Ramyah, southern Lebanon. The IDF forcibly entered the base, demanded that the lights be turned off, and left after protests from UNIFIL. During this breach, smoke from nearby rounds affected 15 peacekeepers, causing skin irritation and gastrointestinal problems. This incident follows other violations in the area, including a restriction on UNIFIL’s logistical movements by the IDF【9†source】.

2. **Damage and Injuries**: Earlier in October, multiple UNIFIL positions have been damaged by nearby shelling, and five UN peacekeepers have been injured by gunfire and explosions near the UN headquarters in Naqoura. Some of these injuries required medical treatment, and one peacekeeper underwent surgery.

3. **International Response**: In light of these incidents, a coalition of 34 nations, including Malaysia, France, Spain, and others, issued a joint statement condemning the attacks on UNIFIL. The statement emphasized the importance of protecting UN personnel and ensuring that the peacekeepers' mandate is respected. The signatory nations reaffirmed their commitment to supporting UNIFIL’s mission in southern Lebanon.

These developments reflect the fragile security situation in southern Lebanon, with ongoing clashes between Hezbollah and Israel further complicating UNIFIL’s peacekeeping efforts.

> In October 2024, UNIFIL peacekeepers in Lebanon faced multiple security incidents, including an IDF tank breaching a UN base and injuries from nearby shelling. Internationally, 34 nations condemned the attacks, urging respect for UNIFIL’s mandate and the safety of personnel amidst growing regional tensions.

# What is Wayanad’s new X-band radar?

After devastating floods and landslides killed more than 200 people in Kerala’s Wayanad district in July 2024, the Union Ministry of Earth Sciences approved an X-band radar to be installed in the district. A torrential downpour triggered the landslide in the valley above Punchirimattom, near the Mundakkai region; its effects were compounded by a massive debris flow triggered by the rains.

### How do radars work?

Radar is short for **‘radio detection and ranging’**. The device uses radio waves to determine the distance, velocity, and physical characteristics of objects around the device. A transmitter emits a signal aimed at an object whose characteristics are to be ascertained (in meteorology, this could be a cloud). A part of the emitted signal is echoed by the object back to the device, where a receiver tracks and analyses it.

Weather radar, also known as a Doppler radar, is a common application of this device. The Doppler effect is the change in frequency of sound waves as their source moves towards and away from a listener. In meteorology, Doppler radars can reveal how fast a cloud is moving and in which direction based on how the cloud’s relative motion changes the frequency of the radiation striking it.

A pulse-Doppler radar can measure the intensity of, say, rainfall by emitting radiation in pulses and tracking how often they’re reflected to the receiver.

This way, modern Doppler radars can monitor weather conditions and anticipate new wind patterns, the formation of storms, etc.

### What is an X-band radar?

Doppler radar relies on Rayleigh scattering, when the scatterer is much smaller than the wavelength of the radiation. A radar trying to ‘see’ smaller particles like rain droplets or fog will need to use radiation of lower wavelengths, like in the X-band. An X-band radar is radar that emits radiation in the X-band of the electromagnetic spectrum: 8-12 GHz, corresponding to wavelengths of around 2-4 cm (this is in the microwave part of the spectrum.)

The smaller wavelengths allow the radar to produce images of higher resolution. However, the greater the frequency of some radiation, the faster it will be attenuated. So X-band radars have a relatively shorter range.

In Wayanad, the new radar is expected to be able to monitor the movements of particles, such as soil, to inform landslide warnings. The device will also perform high temporal sampling, that is, rapidly sample its environs, allowing it to spot particle movements happening in shorter spans of time.

### How many radars does India have?

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) started using radar for weather applications in the early 1950s. The first indigenously designed and manufactured X-band storm detection radar was installed in 1970 in New Delhi. In 1996, IMD replaced 10 outdated X-band radars with digital X-band radars.

In its X-band radar network, India has both wind-finding and storm-detecting radars, and some with dual capabilities. The country also uses S-band radars (2-4 GHz) for long-range detection. The first S-band cyclone detection radar was installed in Visakhapatnam in 1970 and the first locally made variant was commissioned in Mumbai in 1980.

In September 2024, the Ministry of Earth Sciences said India is set to have 56 additional Doppler radars in a few years. On September 11, the Union Cabinet cleared the ₹2,000-crore ‘Mission Mausam’ to upgrade meteorological infrastructure in the country. This includes installing up to 60 meteorological radars until 2026 under the Mission’s first phase.

Minister of State for Earth Sciences Jitendra Pradhan said in August in Parliament that the government has started the process to procure and install 10 X-band Doppler radars to improve weather forecasting in the northeast States and in Himachal Pradesh’s Lahaul and Spiti district.

The initiative to install an X-band radar in Wayanad included installing a C-band radar (4-8 GHz) with an observational range of 250 km in Mangaluru.

### What is NISAR?

**NASA and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)** are currently developing a satellite called NISAR, short for ‘NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar’. It will use radar imaging to produce a high-resolution map of the earth’s landmasses.

Its payload consists of an L-band radar (1.25 GHz, 24 cm) built by NASA and an S-band radar (3.2 GHz, 9.3 cm) built by ISRO. Together they will track and record changes in the earth’s various natural processes.

It is currently expected to be launched onboard an ISRO GSLV Mk II rocket in 2025, at a total cost of $1.5 billion, the bulk of it borne by NASA.

# Why precision medicine in India can’t advance without biobank laws

**Precision medicine** is bringing in a new era of personalised healthcare. The field began to take concrete shape when scientists were wrapping up the **Human Genome Project**. Since then, genomics has played a major role in the diagnosis and treatment of various cancers, chronic diseases, and immunological, cardiovascular, and liver diseases.

Other emerging technologies, such as **gene editing and mRNA therapeutics**, also contribute to precision medicine. In a recent success story, researchers were able to restore vision in people who had lost it due to a genetic mutation using gene therapy. In a more recent and more notable example, researchers in the U.K. reversed an individual’s diabetes by transplanting reengineered stem cells. During the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers were able to use the mRNA platform to develop new vaccines in record time, winning the technology a Nobel Prize last year.

**Organ-on-chips** is another area that promises precision medical solutions. These small microfluidic devices containing human cells can replicate the microenvironment of a tumour or an organ in a laboratory setting. They are expected to allow researchers to test drugs in settings more similar to the drugs’ eventual users.

### Precision medicine in India

The Indian precision medicine market is estimated to be growing at a CAGR of 16% and is expected to be worth more than $5 billion by 2030, according to industry estimates.

Currently, it contributes 36% of the national **bioeconomy**, alongside cancer immunotherapy, gene editing, biologics, etc. The development of precision therapeutics is also part of the **new ‘BioE3’ policy**.

In October 2023, the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization approved **NexCAR19**, India’s domestically developed **CAR-T cell therapy**, and earlier this year the government opened a dedicated centre for it. Recently, the Apollo Cancer Centre and a collaboration between Siemens Healthineers and the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, opened new facilities to deploy artificial intelligence for precision medicine.

### Biobanks in precision medicine

A biobank is a repository of biological samples, such as blood, DNA, cells, tissues, and/or organs, alongside their genetic data. These samples are collected from consenting individuals and intended for use in research. For precision medicine to succeed, biobanks need to be large and diverse. Otherwise, only a small section of society will benefit from the findings of precision medicine.

Recently, researchers identified people with an undiagnosed rare genetic disorder using data from a biobank and comparing it to people who were already diagnosed with it. Their findings were published in Nature Communications on August 29.

In another study published in Cell on October 3, health researchers created the largest biobank of sarcoma patient-derived organoids to date. Organoids are miniaturised, synthetic versions of organs that can replicate tumours; the researchers used it to understand the sarcoma and identify potential therapies using high-throughput drug screening.

### Biobanks in India

There are 19 registered biobanks in India that host many biological specimens, including cancer cell lines and tissues. Earlier this year, the ‘**Genome India‘ programme** finished sequencing 10,000 genomes from 99 ethnic groups to identify treatments for rare genetic diseases, among others.

The pan-India **‘Phenome India’ project** has collected 10,000 samples to create better prediction models for cardio-metabolic diseases. The **Paediatric Rare Genetic Disorders (PRaGeD) mission** could help identify new genes or variants to develop targeted therapies for genetic diseases that affect children.

However, biobank regulations in India are a significant hurdle to realising the full potential of precision medicine.

### India’s biobanking regulations

The U.K., the U.S., Japan, China, and many European countries have laws or comprehensive regulations that address several biobanking issues, including informed consent, withdrawal rights, privacy, and data protection. At present, India’s regulation of biobanks is inconsistent, with gaps that could undermine public trust and limit the potential of precision medicine. In particular, there is no law to protect the rights of individuals.

The Indian Council for Medical Research handbook on **‘National Ethical Guidelines For Biomedical And Health Research Involving Human Participants**’ and the Department of Biotechnology’s (DBT) practices for data storage and analysis have many gaps. For instance, participants are expected to consent to providing samples without knowing how their data will be used, who will have access to it, for how long they will be stored, and when they will be used. Genetic information can provide details about a person, including their family, that also could result in discrimination.

Next, in the absence of a single authority to regulate biobanks and no penalty for misconduct, the risk of inconsistencies arising from sample mishandling and ethical violations like data or sample sharing for non-consenting purposes is nontrivial.

Without proper regulations, many pharmaceutical companies, including those abroad, will have access to samples from India. Research projects often require researchers and pharmaceutical companies to collaborate with biobanks during drug discovery and development.

In the absence of an overarching law, Indians could be deprived of the ownership of biological samples and/or the data thereof and the profits from the resulting research findings.

### A leadership opportunity

Taken together, strong data and privacy protections and regulatory oversight by an expert committee will encourage more people to share samples and participate without worry. It will also allow research to happen on the right foundations instead of the findings becoming the fruits of a poisoned tree.

India is a part of international groups like the Quad and BRICS, and an important plank of its soft diplomatic efforts has been pharmaceuticals. It is a major supplier of generic drugs and is a hub of vaccine manufacturing, and it has plans to expand leadership to include next-generation therapeutics. To do this, it will have to align its biobanking laws with global standards to encourage public participation and trust.

# Ladakh aurorae validate space weather tracking, scientists say

The recent sighting of the **aurora** in **Ladakh**, an unusual phenomenon for this region, has attracted significant attention from scientists and the public alike. Typically, auroras—commonly known as **Northern Lights** in the Northern Hemisphere—are observed in high-latitude areas near the poles, such as in Canada, Norway, and Alaska. These displays are caused by charged particles from the Sun interacting with Earth's magnetic field and atmosphere, creating vibrant lights in the sky that are usually green, red, or purple.

In Ladakh, located much farther south than the typical aurora observation zones, the appearance of this natural phenomenon indicates an unusual level of **geomagnetic activity**. The team of **astrophysicists** monitoring space weather reported that they had predicted the aurora sighting 48-72 hours prior to the event. Their ability to forecast the occurrence is rooted in advances in **space weather monitoring**, which tracks solar wind activity and its interaction with Earth's magnetic field.

### How Auroras Occur

Auroras are produced when charged particles from the **solar wind**, mainly electrons and protons, collide with gases in Earth's atmosphere, like oxygen and nitrogen. These collisions release energy in the form of light, producing the colorful auroras. The colors depend on the type of gas and the altitude of the collisions; oxygen at higher altitudes produces red auroras, while lower altitude collisions produce green light, the most common aurora color.

These phenomena are usually confined to higher latitudes because Earth’s **magnetic field** funnels solar particles toward the poles. However, during periods of heightened solar activity—such as **solar storms**—these particles can spread to lower latitudes, allowing regions like Ladakh to witness auroras.

### Importance of Space Weather Monitoring

The **Indian Institute of Astrophysics** and other related institutions have been improving space weather prediction models, which focus on understanding the Sun’s behavior and its effects on Earth’s environment. Space weather events, such as solar flares and **coronal mass ejections (CMEs)**, can have wide-reaching consequences. Not only do they cause auroras, but they can also disrupt satellite communication, GPS signals, and even power grids.

This aurora sighting in Ladakh is a direct result of such space weather activity, and the ability to predict it signifies an important step in understanding and preparing for the effects of solar events on Earth. The astrophysicists who forecasted this aurora are part of a growing effort to monitor **geomagnetic storms** that result from solar wind hitting Earth’s magnetic field.

### Implications of the Aurora in Ladakh

The aurora sighting in Ladakh is a rare and spectacular event for the region, which is not typically associated with such phenomena. Its occurrence highlights the global nature of space weather and its potential to affect regions far from the poles. For researchers, it validates the importance of continuous monitoring and improvement in predictive models.

In conclusion, Ladakh’s recent aurora sighting is not only a beautiful display of nature but also a testament to the advancements in space weather science. As technology improves, so too will our ability to predict and prepare for such awe-inspiring—and potentially disruptive—events.

### What are aurora australis and aurora borealis? How are these triggered? (Answer in 250 words)-> 2024 GS1 mains question
**Aurora Borealis** (Northern Lights) and **Aurora Australis** (Southern Lights) are captivating natural light displays occurring in the polar regions, caused by the interaction between solar wind and Earth’s magnetic field.

These phenomena are triggered by charged particles from the Sun, known as the **solar wind**, which are directed towards Earth. When these particles reach Earth’s magnetic field, they are funneled towards the magnetic poles. As the particles collide with atoms of oxygen and nitrogen in Earth’s atmosphere, energy is released in the form of light, creating auroras.

The colors of the auroras depend on the type of atmospheric gas and the altitude at which the collisions occur:
- **Green** is the most common color and is produced when solar particles collide with oxygen molecules at lower altitudes.
- **Red** is produced at higher altitudes by oxygen atoms.
- **Blue and purple** hues occur when solar particles collide with nitrogen atoms.

Auroras are more frequent during periods of heightened **solar activity**, such as solar flares or coronal mass ejections (CMEs). These events enhance the flow of solar particles into Earth’s atmosphere, leading to more intense and widespread auroras.

Auroras are not only stunning light shows but also indicators of **space weather**, which can have significant impacts on satellite communication, GPS systems, and power grids. Monitoring auroras is, therefore, an important aspect of understanding and preparing for geomagnetic storms.

> Recently, the rare sighting of an **aurora** in **Ladakh**, India, typically seen only in polar regions, captured significant attention. The phenomenon was triggered by heightened **geomagnetic activity** caused by solar wind interactions with Earth's magnetic field. These charged particles from the Sun collided with atmospheric gases, producing reddish and greenish light in the night sky.

A team of astrophysicists, involved in **space weather monitoring**, had predicted the event 48-72 hours earlier, underscoring the progress in space weather forecasting. The sighting in Ladakh highlights the broader implications of solar storms, which can affect satellite communications and GPS systems, emphasizing the importance of continuous geomagnetic monitoring and research.

# Scuttling people’s right to information

The **Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005**, has been a transformative law in India, empowering citizens by providing them the ability to request information from public authorities. This landmark legislation aims to promote transparency and accountability in governance, allowing ordinary citizens to hold authorities accountable for their actions and decisions. Over the years, the RTI Act has been instrumental in exposing corruption, ensuring the delivery of basic rights, and unveiling key issues that affect democratic functioning.

One of the most significant impacts of the RTI Act has been its role in exposing corruption. Citizens have frequently used RTI to access records of public expenditure, allocation of resources, and the delivery of government services. For example, **Magsaysay awardee Aruna Roy**, who has been one of the key proponents of the RTI movement in India, has highlighted how it has helped to expose corrupt practices in the **public distribution system (PDS)** and various welfare schemes, ensuring that public resources reach the intended beneficiaries. 

Moreover, the RTI Act has been instrumental in scrutinizing controversial government schemes. For instance, the **electoral bonds scheme**, which was introduced to facilitate anonymous donations to political parties, was critically examined through RTI requests. Citizens and activists used the Act to request information about the lack of transparency in the scheme, raising concerns about how it could potentially promote black money in politics. Despite the government’s reluctance to disclose crucial details about the scheme, the RTI Act allowed civil society to question its impact on electoral integrity.

However, the success of the RTI Act has also drawn significant backlash. There have been increasing instances of attacks on RTI activists, many of whom have faced harassment, threats, or even death for exposing powerful individuals or institutions. According to a 2022 report by **Transparency International India**, over 100 RTI activists have been killed or harassed since the Act's implementation. This violence reflects the growing discomfort among those in power regarding the ability of ordinary citizens to access information and challenge corruption.

The RTI Act itself has also come under threat. Recent amendments to the law, particularly the **RTI Amendment Bill, 2019**, have been seen as efforts to dilute the power and independence of the **Central Information Commission (CIC)**. The amendments give the government greater control over the terms and tenure of information commissioners, raising concerns that it could undermine the independence of the body responsible for enforcing the Act.

In conclusion, the RTI Act has played a critical role in empowering citizens, fostering transparency, and holding power accountable in India. However, its success has led to growing resistance from those who feel threatened by its implications. As the RTI Act enters its 20th year, safeguarding its integrity and ensuring the protection of activists who use it remains a vital challenge for Indian democracy.

### Vacant posts

Governments are scuttling the RTI Act by not appointing information commissioners and allowing the commissions to crumble under the weight of mounting backlogs. A 2023-24 report of the Satark Nagrik Sangathan,a citizens group that campaigns for transparency in government functioning, shows that seven out of 29 information commissions were defunct for varying periods of time last year. The commission of Jharkhand has not been functional for over four years, while those of Tripura and Telangana have been defunct for three years and one and a half years, respectively.

Many information commissions were found to be functioning without an adequate number of commissioners, despite large backlogs. The information commission of Maharashtra, with a backlog more than 1 lakh appeals and complaints, is headless. Six out of 11 posts of commissioners are lying vacant. Since May 2015, not a single information commissioner has been appointed to the Central Information Commission by the Central government without citizens having to approach courts. Despite repeated directions by the Supreme Court, eight out of 11 posts are vacant in the Central Information Commission.

Under the RTI Act, information commissions are the final appellate authority and are mandated to safeguard and facilitate people’s right to information. They have wide-ranging powers, including the power of direct disclosure of information which the government finds inconvenient. It is because adequate information commissioners have not been appointed that more than 4 lakh appeals and complaints are pending in information commissions across India. The report shows that it would take more than a year for an appeal or complaint to be disposed in 14 commissions. A fresh appeal filed in Chhattisgarh or Bihar would be disposed only in 2029. While hearing a petition regarding vacancies in information commissions across India, in 2023, the Supreme Court noted that the failure to fill vacancies is leading to a situation where “the right to information which is recognised under an Act of Parliament becomes a dead letter.”

Even when appointments are made, a majority of the appointees are either retired government officials or people who enjoy political patronage. They are often reluctant to act against violations of the transparency law. The report shows that commissions did not impose penalties in 95% of the cases where penalties could be imposed. This failure sends a signal that violating the law will not invite serious consequences. This destroys the basic framework of incentives and disincentives built into the RTI Act, promotes a culture of impunity, and exasperates applicants who seek information at a high cost and often against great odds. The laxity in enforcing accountability allows information officers to take liberties with the RTI Act, leading to many unanswered applications and an equal number of delayed or illegitimately refused ones.

### Regressive amendments

In the last five years, there have also been regressive amendments to the RTI Act. In 2019, despite strong objections from civil society and Opposition parties, the government brought amendments which dealt a blow to the autonomy of information commissions by empowering the Central government to determine the tenure, salaries, pensions and post-retirement entitlements of all information commissioners.

The Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023, included an explicit provision to amend the RTI law to exempt all personal information from disclosure. The RTI Act of 2005 provided for protection of the privacy of individuals through section 8(1)(j). In order to invoke this section to deny personal information, at least one of the following grounds had to be proven: information sought had no relationship to any public activity or public interest; or information sought was such that it would cause unwarranted invasion of privacy, and the information officer was satisfied that there is no larger public interest that justified disclosure. The DPDP Act amended section 8(1)(j) to expand its purview and exempt all personal information from the ambit of the RTI Act. It also deleted a key provision in the law, which gave citizens a right to information at par with Members of Parliament and Members of Legislative Assemblies.

According to Transparency International India data, nearly 100 people have been killed for using the RTI Act, and thousands have been assaulted, threatened, and slapped with false cases. Though the Whistleblowers Protection Act was passed in 2014, it remains confined to the statute books as the Central government has failed to formulate rules to operationalise it. Every year, some 6 million information applications are filed in India. Evidence shows that the RTI law has initiated the vital task of redistributing power in a democratic framework and transforming the relationship between the government and citizens. An erosion of this fundamental right is an erosion of democracy.

> The **Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005** has empowered Indian citizens by enabling them to access government records, exposing corruption, and demanding transparency in governance. It has been instrumental in bringing to light issues such as corruption in welfare schemes and the lack of transparency in the electoral bonds system. However, the law faces backlash, with RTI activists experiencing harassment and threats. Additionally, amendments like the **RTI Amendment Bill, 2019**, which give the government control over the Central Information Commission, have raised concerns about diluting the Act's effectiveness and independence. Safeguarding the RTI’s integrity remains crucial for Indian democracy.

# A critical message for the urban elite

Urban planning failures have severe and disproportionate impacts on marginalized communities, particularly those engaged in physically demanding, outdoor, or low-paying jobs. Delivery workers, auto drivers, construction laborers, domestic workers, and street vendors bear the brunt of extreme heat, poor air quality, and a lack of green spaces, which directly affect their health, income, and overall well-being.

1. **Delivery Workers**: In the gig economy, delivery workers are constantly navigating city streets to meet rising demand for online orders. The relentless heat, combined with long hours on the road, leaves them with little access to hydration or cooling infrastructure, significantly impacting their health.

2. **Auto Drivers**: Auto-rickshaw drivers face prolonged exposure to extreme temperatures as they spend the majority of their day outdoors. The lack of tree cover or shaded areas on city roads exacerbates this problem, and the high levels of urban heat stress make it harder for them to work comfortably and safely.

3. **Construction Workers**: Construction laborers, often working in unsafe conditions, are forced to endure harsh sunlight and high temperatures. Many lack adequate shade or hydration, increasing the risk of heat-related illnesses like heatstroke. Poor urban planning, which neglects to provide basic worker amenities on construction sites, worsens their working conditions.

4. **Domestic Workers and Street Vendors**: Women domestic workers, who often travel on foot or rely on inadequate public transportation, experience the harsh effects of urban heat as they move between jobs. Street vendors, who depend on foot traffic, see their earnings dwindle as customers avoid going out in extreme heat. Without proper shelters, cooling, or shade, vendors suffer from both health issues and loss of income.

These groups are particularly vulnerable due to limited access to air-conditioned environments and safe public spaces. Poor urban planning, including a scarcity of parks, trees, and water bodies, exacerbates the urban heat island effect, making life in cities increasingly unbearable for those at the margins. The consequences include deteriorating public health, widening income disparities, and declining quality of life for the urban poor. Addressing these issues requires urgent reforms in urban planning to ensure that cities become more livable, resilient, and inclusive, prioritizing the needs of the most vulnerable populations.

The unintended consequence of our thriving app ecosystem, built on a labour surplus economy, has not been widely discussed in public discourse and warrants a deeper examination for its societal implications.

Our tech-enabled ecosystem has redefined the concept of “luxury”, creating a comfort trap that reduces our motivation to engage with the outside world. It has led to greater human domestication and a detachment from the environment around us. Tech coupled with privilege has also invisibilised labour, which is making us lose our empathy. In service complexes, guards receive deliveries at building gates, reducing our interaction with the people who serve us. In all these instances, a common theme is that the urban elite are willing to pay a premium to trade discomfort for convenience. Unfortunately, the insulation of the upper classes from the external environment has profound implications for urban governance and the local economy.

When the privileged encounter issues such as poor public services or inadequate infrastructure, these problems often gain media attention, prompting governmental action. For instance, the flash storm in Delhi some months ago that led to the flooding of basements in posh areas and even the houses of Members of Parliament in Lutyens’ Delhi. This led to swift action by the authorities.

Similarly, public schools often lack resources because the affluent prefer private institutions. And public transportation receives less focus and funding as the elite avoid using it.

Even more worrisome is the fact that we are entering a vicious cycle. While heatwaves force people indoors, technology enables this behaviour, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy: worsening urban conditions make outdoor engagement unbearable which further increases reliance on technology. As a result, the wealthy demand fewer public service improvements, making cities less liveable for everyone.

The broader societal implications of this change are alarming. As technology is integrating further into our lives, it is reshaping our expectations of urban living. But this integration is not improving the quality of life for the general populace. Instead, it is aggravating existing inequalities and creating new ones.

The need to reconnect

The real challenge lies in breaking free from this comfort trap. Reconnecting with our cities and each other is not just a noble goal; it is essential for our collective survival. We have to snap out of our false sense of comfort and recognise that our world is changing in fundamental ways. We are losing our public spaces and our ability to enjoy outdoor activities due to increasingly frequent extreme weather events. The urban elite must, therefore, leverage their privilege to actively engage with governments and help improve living conditions in our cities. Only by confronting the true state of our urban areas can we hope to rebuild them as equitable, liveable spaces for all.

Let us not let convenience become the architect of the demise of our cities.

> Marginalized urban workers, such as delivery personnel, auto drivers, construction laborers, domestic workers, and street vendors, face severe consequences from poor urban planning. They endure extreme heat, lack of green spaces, and poor air quality, which directly impact their health and income. Delivery workers and auto drivers suffer from relentless exposure to the sun with limited access to cooling or hydration. Construction workers labor in unsafe conditions without adequate shade, while domestic workers and street vendors struggle to cope with heat and reduced foot traffic. These issues demand urgent urban planning reforms to protect vulnerable populations and improve livability.

# Nobel prize in physics 2024 

The **2024 Nobel Prize in Physics** was awarded to **John J. Hopfield** and **Geoffrey E. Hinton** for their pioneering work on artificial neural networks, a critical foundation for modern machine learning.

# Biology transformed

The 2023 Nobel Prize in Chemistry has been awarded to **David Baker**, **Demis Hassabis**, and **John M. Jumper** for their groundbreaking work in protein structure prediction and protein creation. This recognition highlights two major advancements: Baker’s success in creating entirely new proteins and the development of **AlphaFold**, an artificial intelligence (AI) model by Hassabis and Jumper, that predicts the complex 3D structures of proteins.

### AlphaFold: Revolutionizing Protein Structure Prediction
Proteins are fundamental to life, performing a wide range of biological functions, but understanding how they work requires knowledge of their 3D structures. Determining this structure has historically been a time-consuming task, involving techniques like **X-ray crystallography** and **cryo-electron microscopy**. Even with these advanced methods, only around a third of human proteins had their structures fully determined by 2020.

Hassabis and Jumper, working at **DeepMind**, transformed the field with their AI model **AlphaFold**. This system uses deep learning techniques to predict how a string of amino acids—the building blocks of proteins—folds into a 3D shape, a problem that has stumped scientists for decades. Protein folding is so complex that even a protein of 100 amino acids can theoretically assume 10^47 possible shapes.

In 2020, AlphaFold achieved accuracy comparable to experimental methods like X-ray crystallography. By 2021, the model had predicted the structure of almost all **200 million proteins** found across various species. The success of AlphaFold lies in its ability to estimate the accuracy of its own predictions, providing researchers with reliability scores. The model's code has been publicly available since 2021 and has been used by millions of researchers globally, advancing drug discovery, enzyme design, and other biological fields.

### David Baker’s Protein Creation
While AlphaFold focuses on predicting existing protein structures, **David Baker** took a different approach—creating entirely new proteins that do not exist in nature. Using his software **Rosetta**, Baker developed methods to design novel protein structures and then determine the amino acid sequences that would produce those structures. His software matches desired protein shapes with known fragments of proteins, optimizing them to propose new sequences.

This ability to create custom proteins with new functions opens up vast possibilities in biotechnology, medicine, and materials science. For instance, these new proteins could be designed to bind specific targets in the body, offering potential applications in targeted drug delivery, synthetic biology, and enzyme engineering.

Both **AlphaFold** and **Rosetta** are freely accessible to the scientific community, fostering collaborative research and enabling rapid advancements in multiple areas of biology and chemistry. By making their tools open-source, Hassabis, Jumper, and Baker have empowered researchers worldwide to expand the applications of their discoveries and push the boundaries of science further.

In summary, the Nobel Prize-winning work of Baker, Hassabis, and Jumper has revolutionized our understanding of proteins, solving long-standing problems and creating new avenues for scientific exploration and innovation. Their contributions promise to accelerate developments in medicine, biotechnology, and beyond.

# China, India and New Delhi’s Quad dilemma

India's participation in the **Quad** (comprising Australia, India, Japan, and the U.S.) has positioned it at the center of a delicate geopolitical balance, especially with respect to China. During Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the U.S. in September 2024, the Quad meeting produced the **Wilmington Declaration**, which, while not explicitly naming China, left little doubt about its objective to counterbalance China's growing influence across the Indo-Pacific region.

The Quad, which started as a loosely-knit group focused on strategic dialogues, is gradually evolving into what some perceive as a security alliance. This shift has been driven by growing concerns over China's assertiveness, especially in the South China Sea and broader Indo-Pacific region. The declaration emphasizes the importance of maritime cooperation, shared democratic values, and a free and open Indo-Pacific, indirectly addressing China’s expansionist policies. However, there is no formal mutual defense agreement yet, signaling that the Quad is still in the process of formalizing its security posture.

For India, this situation is particularly sensitive. India shares a long and disputed border with China and has been involved in military standoffs, most notably in the Galwan Valley in 2020. India’s involvement in the Quad is seen by China as a strategic counter, which puts India in a tricky position. On one hand, India values its membership in the Quad for the strategic and military cooperation it offers; on the other, it must manage its complex bilateral relationship with China. 

M.K. Narayanan, former Director of India’s **Intelligence Bureau** and a former **National Security Adviser**, argues that the Quad’s increasingly security-oriented focus could potentially strain India’s relationship with China. India must navigate this "Quad dilemma" by balancing its ties with the Quad members and maintaining a functional relationship with China, a major economic partner and regional competitor.

The Quad, despite its robust cooperation, faces challenges in becoming a fully-fledged security alliance. India's reluctance to join any formal defense pact highlights its desire to retain strategic autonomy. Historically, India has favored non-alignment and continues to emphasize strategic independence, resisting the idea of being part of an alliance that could limit its options in dealing with China or other regional powers.

In conclusion, while the **Wilmington Declaration** marks a significant step in the Quad's evolution, India's role within this framework is complicated by its geographic and geopolitical realities. Balancing Quad commitments with its bilateral ties to China will be a critical challenge for India's foreign policy moving forward. The future of the Quad and India’s positioning within it will depend on how effectively it can manage this balancing act.

> India faces a complex geopolitical situation with its involvement in the **Quad** (Australia, India, Japan, U.S.) aimed at countering China’s influence in the Indo-Pacific. The **Wilmington Declaration** from the September 2024 Quad meeting highlighted this, despite not explicitly naming China. For India, the challenge is balancing its strategic cooperation with Quad members while managing its difficult bilateral relationship with China, especially after recent border conflicts. Although the Quad is increasingly seen as a security alliance, India is cautious, preferring strategic autonomy over formal defense agreements, in line with its non-aligned history. Balancing these interests is crucial for India's foreign policy.

# Take the gauntlet

The recent train accident near **Kavaraipettai**, close to Chennai, on October 11, 2024, where a passenger train collided with a stationary goods train, has once again drawn attention to the precarious state of India’s railway infrastructure. Fortunately, no casualties were reported, though several passengers sustained injuries. The accident occurred when the passenger train, after receiving a green signal to proceed, mistakenly entered the loop line and rear-ended the goods train, resulting in 13 bogies overturning, with one catching fire. This incident is significant given the rise in railway accidents across various zones in India, underscoring systemic issues that need urgent attention.

### Incident Overview

In this particular case, railway officials noted that the train passed into the wrong track, leading to the collision. Such occurrences highlight the vulnerabilities in India’s railway signaling and communication systems. With over 1.4 million employees, Indian Railways is one of the largest railway networks globally, serving as a crucial transport artery for both people and goods. However, despite its vastness, the infrastructure has often been criticized for being outdated and prone to errors. This incident, while less catastrophic in terms of casualties, could have been avoided with proper protective measures in place.

### The ‘Kavach’ System

A key solution being discussed is the **Kavach system**, a technology designed to prevent train collisions and derailments by automatically controlling trains. The system stops trains if they overshoot signals or detect an obstruction on the tracks. In the context of the Kavaraipettai accident, **Kavach** could have intervened and prevented the passenger train from entering the wrong track.

**Kavach**, developed indigenously by Indian Railways, is seen as a key step in modernizing the country's railway network. While promising, its implementation is slow. It has only been installed on select routes, and broader coverage is required. It’s estimated that the government could extend Kavach across its entire railway network within a decade using just 2% of its annual capital expenditure. This, however, depends on consistent political will and proper allocation of funds. Some politicians have expressed impatience, demanding faster implementation, but experts note that the effects of deploying such technology will only become clear over the long term, not in a few months.

### The Need for Infrastructure Overhaul

While **Kavach** is a much-needed safety mechanism, it alone cannot resolve all the issues plaguing Indian Railways. The signaling system, in particular, is outdated in many parts of the country and requires immediate modernization. A single miscommunication or signal error can lead to fatal accidents, as demonstrated by the Kavaraipettai collision.

Furthermore, **track maintenance** and **train rerouting protocols** need to be examined. In this incident, a seemingly minor decision to reroute the passenger train onto a different track turned into a major accident, revealing the fragile nature of the existing system. The importance of prioritizing **track safety** and modernizing the **signaling infrastructure** cannot be overstated.

### Broader Concerns

This accident is not an isolated event but part of a troubling trend of railway mishaps across the country. In recent years, accidents due to signaling failures, human errors, and faulty infrastructure have increased. The government's **National Rail Plan 2030** seeks to address some of these issues by expanding railway capacity and introducing modern safety systems, but progress remains slow.

### Conclusion

The **Kavaraipettai train collision** serves as a wake-up call for the Indian Railways to accelerate its efforts in modernizing its safety and signaling infrastructure. While the **Kavach system** presents a promising solution, it is not a cure-all. A comprehensive approach involving both technology and infrastructure upgrades is necessary to ensure the safety of millions of passengers who rely on Indian Railways every day. Implementing **Kavach** across the entire network, alongside overhauling outdated systems, should be treated as a national priority to prevent such accidents in the future.

> The October 11, 2024, **train accident near Kavaraipettai**, Chennai, where a passenger train collided with a stationary goods train, highlighted systemic vulnerabilities in India’s railway infrastructure. Although there were no casualties, several were injured, and 13 bogies overturned. The collision occurred after the passenger train mistakenly entered a loop line. The incident underscores the need for comprehensive safety measures like the **Kavach system**, a collision prevention technology. While Kavach’s full implementation could reduce such accidents, overhauling India’s outdated **signaling systems** and infrastructure is also essential for long-term railway safety and reliability.

# Advocacy groups challenge FSSAI’s draft notification on removing food labels

The recent draft notification by the **Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI)** proposing an amendment to remove warning labels on iron-fortified food products has stirred significant concern, especially from citizen and patient advocacy groups. These groups are calling for the FSSAI to reconsider its decision, as such labels are crucial for individuals suffering from **thalassemia** and **sickle cell anaemia**. 

### Current Label Requirements

Presently, food products fortified with iron must carry a label advising that individuals with **thalassemia** should only consume them under medical supervision and that those with **sickle cell anaemia** should avoid them entirely. These labels are important because both conditions involve complications related to iron metabolism, making excess iron potentially harmful. 

1. **Thalassemia**: Individuals with this genetic blood disorder often require regular blood transfusions, which can lead to iron overload in the body. Consuming additional iron, especially through fortified foods, can worsen this condition, leading to complications like liver and heart disease. Hence, the warning label advises medical supervision.
   
2. **Sickle Cell Anaemia**: This inherited blood disorder affects hemoglobin and can cause painful episodes and anemia. These patients do not benefit from additional iron intake and, in fact, may face adverse effects. Thus, the warning label advises complete avoidance of iron-fortified foods for these individuals.

### Concerns Over the Draft Amendment

The **FSSAI's draft notification dated September 18, 2024**, proposing to remove these labels, has triggered alarm within the medical and patient advocacy communities. The removal of warning labels could put vulnerable populations at risk, as they may inadvertently consume iron-fortified products without understanding the potential consequences. Advocacy groups argue that the labels are a key safeguard that ensures people with these specific blood disorders can avoid further health complications.

**Patient advocacy groups** have highlighted that the amendment may overlook the medical needs of those with rare genetic disorders. Additionally, there is concern that the general public, who may not be fully aware of the dangers of excess iron intake for such conditions, could be misled into thinking that iron-fortified products are universally beneficial.

### Calls for Reconsideration

Given the potential health risks, advocacy groups have requested the FSSAI to revisit this decision. They argue that these labels are not just a regulatory requirement but also serve as a protective measure for vulnerable patients. Furthermore, removing the labels could increase the burden on the healthcare system, as individuals with thalassemia and sickle cell anaemia may require more intensive medical care if they suffer complications from iron overload.

Medical professionals and public health experts also support retaining the warning labels. They point out that while fortification of foods with iron can help combat anemia and nutritional deficiencies in the general population, it can be detrimental to specific groups who are sensitive to iron intake.

### Broader Implications

This debate over labeling also highlights a broader issue in public health policymaking—how to balance the nutritional needs of the general population with the health risks posed to specific vulnerable groups. While iron fortification is an effective public health measure to address widespread iron deficiency, the needs of those with conditions like thalassemia and sickle cell anaemia must not be ignored. 

In conclusion, while the FSSAI’s proposed amendment may aim to streamline labeling regulations, it risks compromising the health of individuals with specific medical conditions. It is critical that the FSSAI takes into account the concerns raised by advocacy groups and medical professionals to ensure that public health regulations protect all individuals, including those with genetic disorders like thalassemia and sickle cell anaemia.

> The **FSSAI's draft notification** to remove warning labels on iron-fortified food products for individuals with **thalassemia** and **sickle cell anaemia** has raised concerns among patient advocacy groups. These groups argue that the labels are crucial to prevent health risks, as excess iron can lead to serious complications for these individuals. Currently, the labels advise people with thalassemia to consume such products under medical supervision and recommend complete avoidance for those with sickle cell anaemia. Advocacy groups are urging the FSSAI to reconsider, emphasizing the need for safeguards to protect vulnerable populations from inadvertent harm.

# Israeli tanks ram gate of UN peace mission in Lebanon

On October 13, 2024, Israeli tanks destroyed the gate of a United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) base in Ramyah, located in southern Lebanon, and forcibly entered the peacekeeper's facility. The incident occurred amid escalating tensions between Israel and Hezbollah, as the Israeli military has intensified its operations against the militant group in the region.

According to reports, two Israeli Merkava tanks breached the gate of the UNIFIL base and remained inside for about 45 minutes before withdrawing. This incident followed previous Israeli attempts to block the movement of UNIFIL forces in southern Lebanon, and it marked a significant violation of the peacekeepers' position. UNIFIL stated that 15 of its personnel were affected by smoke after Israeli forces fired rounds near the base, causing skin irritation and other mild health issues.

Israel has repeatedly called for the removal of UNIFIL from southern Lebanon, claiming that Hezbollah militants are using peacekeepers as "human shields." Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged the UN to evacuate its personnel from the region, warning of further escalation if they remain. However, UNIFIL, which plays a crucial role in maintaining peace and monitoring ceasefire violations since the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, has refused to leave, despite ongoing hostilities.

The incident drew international condemnation, with 40 countries expressing their outrage and calling for an investigation into Israel’s actions. They emphasized the importance of UNIFIL’s presence in maintaining stability in southern Lebanon, especially given the fragile security situation in the region. These countries called for the immediate cessation of attacks on peacekeepers and urged all parties to ensure their safety.

UNIFIL has been stationed in Lebanon since 1978, and its role has been critical in de-escalating tensions between Israel and Hezbollah. However, the recent surge in violence has placed the mission under significant strain, raising concerns about its ability to operate effectively in such a volatile environment.

The **United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL)** was established in 1978 through UN Security Council Resolutions 425 and 426, following Israel's invasion of southern Lebanon. The primary purpose of UNIFIL was to confirm Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon, restore peace and security, and assist the Lebanese government in regaining authority over the area.

### Mandate and Key Functions of UNIFIL:

1. **Monitoring Ceasefires**:
   UNIFIL’s mandate was later expanded after the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah under Resolution 1701. This resolution tasked UNIFIL with monitoring the cessation of hostilities, supervising the withdrawal of Israeli forces, and ensuring that southern Lebanon remained free of unauthorized armed personnel, excluding the Lebanese army.

2. **Assisting the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF)**:
   UNIFIL works closely with the LAF, helping them deploy in southern Lebanon and maintain security. This collaboration has been critical in ensuring that Hezbollah does not rearm and that the Lebanese government maintains control over the region.

3. **Humanitarian Assistance**:
   UNIFIL also plays a role in providing humanitarian assistance, especially during times of conflict. The force helps deliver aid to civilians affected by hostilities and assists with rebuilding infrastructure destroyed during conflicts.

4. **Conflict Mediation**:
   A key role of UNIFIL is to act as a buffer between Israeli forces and Hezbollah. By maintaining a presence in southern Lebanon, UNIFIL helps prevent direct clashes and facilitates communication between both sides to reduce the risk of escalation. Its position allows it to monitor any violations of the ceasefire and report them to the UN.

5. **Mine Clearance**:
   UNIFIL has also been involved in clearing landmines and unexploded ordnance in southern Lebanon. This effort is vital for ensuring the safety of local communities and allowing displaced persons to return to their homes.

### Composition and Strength:

UNIFIL is one of the largest peacekeeping missions in the world, comprising over 10,000 troops from more than 40 countries. It also includes around 800 civilian personnel who provide logistical and administrative support. Countries such as Italy, France, Spain, and Ghana are key contributors to the mission. 

### Recent Challenges:

The situation in southern Lebanon remains tense, especially due to the ongoing hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah. The 2024 incident where Israeli tanks breached a UNIFIL base highlighted the difficulties the force faces in maintaining peace amid escalating violence【7†source】【8†source】. The Israeli government has been critical of UNIFIL’s presence, accusing it of failing to prevent Hezbollah’s military buildup near the Israeli border. However, the force has consistently reiterated its commitment to its mandate and refused to withdraw, despite pressure from Israel.

In recent times, there have been multiple attacks on UNIFIL forces, which have led to injuries among peacekeepers. Countries contributing troops to UNIFIL, including France, Spain, and Italy, have condemned these attacks and called for investigations into the incidents. These nations see UNIFIL's presence as crucial for regional stability and fear that any reduction in its presence could lead to a resurgence of violence.

### Future of UNIFIL:

The future of UNIFIL is uncertain, given the complex and volatile nature of the Israel-Hezbollah conflict. While Israel calls for a reassessment of the mission, many international players believe UNIFIL’s presence is essential for preventing another full-scale war. The UN is likely to maintain the mission, but its effectiveness depends on continued international support and cooperation between Lebanon, Israel, and Hezbollah.

In conclusion, UNIFIL remains a cornerstone of peacekeeping in southern Lebanon, working under challenging circumstances to fulfill its mandate. However, the current environment, characterized by increased hostilities and complex geopolitical interests, poses significant challenges to the mission's success.
