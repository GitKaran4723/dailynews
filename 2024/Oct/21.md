# What does the new ‘lady justice’ statue signify?

Last week, the Chief Justice of India unveiled the ‘new lady justice’ statue in the Supreme Court premises that replaced the ‘original lady justice’. The new statue is clothed in a saree, has shed the blindfold and holds scales on one hand and the Indian Constitution on the other.

### What is the background?

It is believed that the origin of the modern-day ‘lady justice’ is Justitia, the goddess of Justice in Roman mythology. ‘Lady justice’ is depicted with a blindfold, scales, and a sword. The blindfold was added during the Renaissance period (14th century) probably as a satire on the corrupt state of legal systems with judicial institutions turning a blind eye. It was only during the enlightenment period (17th-18th century) that it was reinterpreted as representing impartiality. It signifies that justice should be administered without bias regardless of wealth, power and social status. The scales represent balance. It emphasises that courts must weigh both sides of an argument before delivering a judgment. Finally, the sword symbolises the power and authority of the law, signifying that the law can both protect and punish.

### Why the change?

When the British established their control over India, they introduced their legal system. The hierarchy of courts from lower courts to the Supreme Court is a relic of the British system. It was during British rule that the ‘lady justice’ became a prominent symbol in India and was placed outside courtrooms.

The new statue is an attempt at decoloniality, with an aim to shed colonial symbols. The saree replacing the western attire brings the statue closer to Indian tradition. The removal of the blindfold and having eyes open is significant in the Indian context. It conveys that the law is not blind and it ‘sees’ everyone equally. More importantly our social diversity, the discrimination faced by underprivileged sections, constitutional provisions and laws made for their upliftment require a nuanced approach of ‘viewing’ every case appropriately and delivering justice. The sword being replaced with the Constitution symbolises the supremacy of the Constitution and its value in our jurisprudence. The preserving of the scales goes on to show that the courts will continue weighing evidence impartially and hearing both sides before delivering its final judgment.

### What urgent actions are needed?

The Supreme Court last week dismissed a Public Interest Litigation which sought a time frame of three years for disposal of over five crore cases pending in all courts of the country. The Supreme Court held that while the demand was desirable, it is practically impossible considering the flood of litigation faced by the justice delivery system. However, ‘justice delayed is justice denied’ and there are some urgent actions needed in this regard with respect to the institution that delivers justice.

Firstly, the revised Memorandum of Procedure that deals with appointment of judges by the collegium has not been finalised for the past eight years. This needs to be finalised by the government and judiciary without any further delay to bring transparency and accountability to the process of appointment.

Secondly, the representation of backward classes, scheduled castes, schedule tribes, and religious minorities is less than 25% in the higher judiciary and women constitute less than 15%. The appointments to higher judiciary should reflect the social diversity of our country. Third, the High Courts invariably operate at only 60-70% strength thereby contributing to the huge pendency of over 60 lakh cases at present. The government needs to appoint collegium recommendations for High Courts without dragging its feet. The vacancies in lower courts, where 4.4 crore cases are pending, should also be filled by the States without backlog. Finally, cases dealing with the constitutional validity of amendments/laws and individual liberty should be heard on a priority basis by the higher judiciary. These measures would ensure that the new symbol is not just symbolic but reflects the actions taken for the delivery of fair and prompt justice.

> The new "Lady Justice" statue, recently unveiled at the New York City Appellate Courthouse, is a modern take on the traditional symbol of justice. Traditionally, Lady Justice is depicted blindfolded, holding scales and a sword, symbolizing impartiality, fairness, and the enforcement of justice. However, the new statue portrays a unique, more progressive image, combining elements of **feminism, strength, and resilience**. Instead of being blindfolded, this version of Lady Justice is bare-headed and adorned with braided hair, reflecting empowerment and an evolving interpretation of justice that aligns with contemporary social values, emphasizing inclusivity and moral clarity.

# On climate finance to developing nations

The 29th Conference of the Parties (COP29) of the UNFCC to be held in Baku, Azerbaijan, from November 11 to 22 is expected to be a “finance COP” as key climate finance issues feature at the top of its agenda.

### Are developing states more at risk?

Economically developing countries are among the most vulnerable to climate change’s effects. This is because of geographical factors and, because their economies rely more on sectors like agriculture, which are particularly sensitive to climate change.

Despite being among the most vulnerable, developing countries have contributed relatively little to the cumulative emissions that cause climate change. According to the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, developed countries account for 57% of cumulative global emissions since 1850 despite hosting smaller populations than the developing world. Developing countries also face competing developmental needs, vexing their ability to take climate action by themselves. The 2009 Copenhagen Accord had developed countries commit to providing $100 billion a year in climate finance to developing countries by 2020, later also made applicable through 2025. A new mobilisation target for the post-2025 period is on the agenda at COP29.

### What is climate finance?

The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) defines climate finance as “local, national, or transnational financing — drawn from public, private, and alternative sources — that seeks to support mitigation and adaptation actions addressing climate change.” This specifies two aspects of climate finance: sources (public or private, and flowing either domestically or across borders) and end-uses (climate mitigation or adaptation). The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) publishes reports on climate finance flows from developed to developing countries. They cover flows from four sources, including international public finance and the private finance mobilised by it. International public climate finance is composed of commercial and concessional loans, grants, equity and other instruments. Loans typically constitute the largest share (69.4% in 2022), followed by grants (28%). However, developing countries and observers such as Oxfam have noted several shortcomings with the OECD’s reports. They have argued they should represent actual disbursals and not simply commitments to provide climate finance; that a flow should be new and additional and not simply a reclassification of existing aid; and that only grants, or grant-equivalents of concessional finance, should be counted, not finance provided on a commercial basis.

### Who needs climate finance?

Developing countries require external financing for climate action. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), 675 million people in the developing world didn't have access to electric power in 2021. Developing countries need to universalise access and increase electricity consumption.

Developing countries also have smaller domestic financial systems relative to their GDPs and face higher costs of capital. For instance, the cost of capital for solar photovoltaic and storage technologies is about twice as high in developing economies than in developed ones, according to the IEA. Therefore, if developing countries are to balance development and climate action, external finance should be made available.

### How much does India need?

India has both short-term and long-term climate targets. By 2030, India aims to install 500 GW of generating capacity from non-fossil-fuel sources; five million metric tonnes per annum of green hydrogen (GH2) production capacity; and differentiated levels of penetration for various Electric Vehicle (EV) categories. The authors have estimated (as part of a co-authored report) that achieving 450 GW of renewable energy by 2030 will require an additional ₹16.8 lakh crore investment. Per the National Green Hydrogen Mission, India’s GH2 target will need ₹8 lakh crore. Consumers will also need to spend around ₹16 lakh crore to purchase EVs to achieve this vision. A long-term perspective reveals a greater requirement: ₹850 lakh crore in investments between 2020 and 2070 to achieve net-zero emissions.

### What should the NCQG quantum be?

Determining a new annual climate finance mobilisation target — called the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) — is a top priority. The NCQG should include flows that are (i) actual disbursals, not just commitments; (ii) new and additional (iii) public capital in the form of direct grants; and (iv) private capital that is mobilised by public capital. However, organically flowing private finance to developing countries should not be counted. An independent high-level expert group constituted by the presidencies of COP26 and COP27 has already determined that developing countries (excluding China) will require around $1 trillion in external finance by 2030.

> The 29th Conference of the Parties (COP29) of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), scheduled from November 11 to 22 in Baku, Azerbaijan, is anticipated to focus on climate finance, earning the label of a "finance COP." Key issues at the top of the agenda include mobilizing funds for climate adaptation and mitigation, addressing the financial commitments made by developed countries to support developing nations, and discussions on loss and damage funding. COP29 aims to advance global climate action by emphasizing the financial resources required to meet the challenges of climate change and support vulnerable regions.

# What do the Atlantic Ocean hurricane forecasts foretell for India?

The **Atlantic Ocean hurricane forecasts** primarily pertain to tropical storms and hurricanes that occur in the **Atlantic Basin**, which includes the Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico. These forecasts are primarily relevant to regions in North America, Central America, and parts of the Caribbean. However, their direct impact on **India** is minimal because India lies in the **Indian Ocean Basin**, far from the Atlantic. Hurricanes, known as **cyclones** in the Indian Ocean region, do not cross from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean due to geographical and meteorological barriers.

That said, there are **indirect implications** that Atlantic hurricane activity can have on India and the global climate. These influences are primarily related to **climate patterns**, **global energy markets**, and **supply chains**, as well as shared lessons in **disaster management** and **preparedness**.

### 1. **Climate Patterns and Global Weather Systems**

Although Atlantic hurricanes do not directly affect India, the **global weather system** is interconnected. Variations in atmospheric circulation patterns, such as **El Niño** and **La Niña**, influence both Atlantic hurricane activity and weather conditions in India. For instance, during an El Niño event, warmer sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean tend to suppress Atlantic hurricane activity but may result in **weaker monsoon seasons** in India. Conversely, during La Niña, Atlantic hurricane activity often increases, and India may experience **stronger monsoons** with the potential for excessive rainfall and flooding.

Thus, while Atlantic hurricanes themselves do not directly affect India, the broader climatic conditions that influence hurricanes can also impact **India’s monsoon patterns**. These shifts in weather can affect agriculture, water resources, and disaster preparedness in India, especially during the critical monsoon season.

### 2. **Global Energy Markets**

The Atlantic hurricane season can disrupt **global energy markets**, particularly in the United States, which is a major producer of **oil and gas**. Many oil refineries and platforms are located in the Gulf of Mexico, and when hurricanes strike these areas, it can lead to a temporary shutdown of production and supply shortages. As a result, **global oil prices** may spike.

India, being a major importer of oil and natural gas, could experience economic consequences from these price fluctuations. Rising oil prices can lead to increased costs for fuel and energy in India, which can, in turn, influence inflation, transportation costs, and overall economic stability. Therefore, while India is not directly impacted by Atlantic hurricanes, it is sensitive to the ripple effects they can have on the global energy market.

### 3. **Supply Chain Disruptions**

Atlantic hurricanes often disrupt **global shipping routes**, especially those that pass through key ports in the United States and the Caribbean. India’s trade, particularly with North American and Latin American markets, can be affected by these disruptions. Shipping delays and increased transportation costs may result from hurricanes causing damage to port infrastructure or necessitating rerouting of shipping lanes. For a globalized economy like India’s, this can lead to challenges in supply chains, affecting sectors like manufacturing, exports, and imports.

### 4. **Disaster Preparedness and Management**

India and other countries in the Indian Ocean region can learn valuable lessons from the **disaster preparedness** and **management strategies** employed by countries frequently affected by Atlantic hurricanes, such as the United States and Caribbean nations. These regions have developed advanced **early warning systems**, **evacuation protocols**, and **post-disaster recovery** frameworks. By observing and implementing best practices from these regions, India can enhance its own **cyclone preparedness** and improve its ability to mitigate damage during natural disasters.

### Conclusion

While the **Atlantic hurricane forecasts** do not have a direct impact on India’s weather, they provide valuable insights into global climate patterns, economic effects, and disaster management practices that can influence India. Variations in Atlantic hurricane activity, driven by broader climate factors such as **El Niño** and **La Niña**, can have implications for India’s monsoon season. Additionally, disruptions in global energy markets and supply chains caused by hurricanes can indirectly affect India’s economy. By staying aware of these global connections, India can better prepare for the indirect consequences of Atlantic hurricane activity.

> Although **Atlantic hurricanes** do not directly affect India, they can have **indirect implications** for the country through global climate patterns, energy markets, and supply chains. Variations in **El Niño** and **La Niña** impact both Atlantic hurricanes and **India's monsoon patterns**, potentially affecting rainfall and agriculture. Additionally, hurricanes can disrupt **global oil production** and increase prices, impacting India's energy costs as a major importer. **Shipping delays** and supply chain disruptions from hurricanes also affect global trade, including India's. Lastly, India can learn from the **disaster preparedness** and management strategies used by Atlantic-facing countries to improve its own response to cyclones.

# Essential business priorities in a changing world

The B-20, or Business 20, is the official G20 dialogue forum with the global business community. At the 2024 B-20 Summit hosted by Brazil, **financial access**, **tailored credit solutions**, and policies promoting **diversity and inclusion** were highlighted as key pillars for fostering sustainable global economic growth. These areas have emerged as essential to addressing structural challenges within economies, promoting inclusivity, and ensuring that businesses of all sizes, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), can thrive in a rapidly changing global landscape.

### Financial Access

One of the central themes of B-20 Brazil is expanding **financial access**. In many countries, particularly emerging markets, access to financial services remains a significant barrier for individuals and businesses. Without proper financial inclusion, vast segments of the population and small businesses are left out of the economic growth narrative. Financial access refers to providing individuals and businesses with affordable, timely, and sufficient financial products and services, including savings accounts, credit, insurance, and digital payment systems.

In Brazil and many other developing nations, a considerable portion of the population remains unbanked, meaning they do not have access to formal financial systems. This limits their ability to save securely, invest, and protect themselves from financial shocks. The B-20 discussions emphasized the need for governments and financial institutions to work collaboratively to ensure broader access to banking services. The rapid rise of fintech solutions was also highlighted as a promising means to bridge this gap, with technology playing a pivotal role in bringing financial services to previously underserved populations.

### Tailored Credit Solutions

Closely linked to financial access is the issue of **tailored credit solutions**, especially for SMEs. SMEs are often described as the backbone of the global economy, accounting for a large share of job creation and economic activity. However, they frequently struggle to secure the necessary credit to expand their operations, innovate, and compete in larger markets. Traditional banking systems often perceive lending to SMEs as risky due to a lack of collateral, insufficient credit history, or market volatility.

B-20 Brazil proposed developing more customized credit solutions that cater to the specific needs and challenges of these businesses. This includes offering more flexible loan terms, innovative credit scoring models that take non-traditional data into account, and leveraging new financial instruments such as peer-to-peer lending and crowdfunding. By creating more tailored financial products, lenders can better serve SMEs, helping them grow while simultaneously managing risk.

The summit also recognized the importance of partnerships between governments, banks, and fintech companies in developing these solutions. Public policies can play a key role in reducing risk for lenders, through guarantees or other mechanisms, encouraging banks to extend credit to sectors that are crucial for economic growth but traditionally underserved.

### Diversity and Inclusion

Another significant focus of the B-20 Summit was **diversity and inclusion**. The global business community increasingly acknowledges the economic and social benefits of creating more inclusive workplaces. Diversity and inclusion policies are not only morally right but also make good business sense. Numerous studies have shown that companies with diverse leadership and inclusive cultures are more innovative, productive, and resilient.

B-20 Brazil stressed that diversity should encompass gender, race, ethnicity, and socio-economic background, and must be a priority for both businesses and governments. The summit called for greater efforts to ensure equal opportunities for marginalized groups, which includes access to education, job training, and leadership positions. Inclusion policies that support women, ethnic minorities, and economically disadvantaged populations in the workforce are crucial for building a more equitable and productive global economy.

### Ensuring better food security

Sustainable food systems and boosting food and nutrition security are another critical pillar of focus for encouraging sustainability efforts. Myriad factors including the impact of extreme weather events have exacerbated the global food crisis. The use of technology and other digital tools in promoting sustainable agricultural practices, reducing waste, and ensuring equitable access to nutritious food for all would be imperative. Businesses can play a pivotal role in addressing food security by advocating sustainable practices, investing in infrastructure and agricultural technologies such as precision farming and fostering collaborations with governments and international organisations for amplifying efforts on food security.

Second, accelerating resilient global trade flows is intrinsic to global growth, yet national security concerns and unfair trade practices are leading to rising tariffs and other hurdles that constrain the efficacy of trade. Organisations such as the World Trade Organization should be strengthened to identify and counter unfair trade practices while agreed interoperable taxonomies for environmental measures can bring in more clarity for businesses in industrial and trade policies aimed at sustainability.

The third priority that businesses must lead is digital transformation and innovation including Artificial Intelligence (AI) for the common good. Businesses must harness AI for responsible use in health care, climate change and resource management. It is also important for businesses to engage youth in developing innovative solutions to pressing contemporary issues and drive positive societal impact. Investments and mentoring for social tech startups, digital platforms for research and development collaborations and developing science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) talent should be taken up by corporates in mission mode.

The sustainability mission is the fourth priority for businesses. As the world accelerates towards net-zero transition, fair and just climate policies can enable businesses to work towards carbon mitigation. Availability of finance is required for all enterprises, and particularly for small and medium enterprises, to align with net zero targets. Building renewable energy capacity and greater use of biofuels and green hydrogen can be promoted by businesses. Industry should also be conscious about circular economy options and strive to inculcate sustainable business practices in their usual operations across the board.

### Aiming for the highest standards

Above all, corporate governance of the highest standards must be prioritised by businesses, and this includes large global corporates and small and medium enterprises. It is the responsibility of the private industry to go beyond established best practices in compliances and regulatory systems to continually drive ethical operations. This will facilitate building trust between different stakeholders including the community, governments and businesses. Trust is today viewed as intrinsic to the growth process and ease of doing business across the world.

These are some of the issues that we would be working on through the B20 Global Institute that was envisaged during India’s B20 leadership and is now taking off. With the participation of successive G-20 presidency countries, the institute will maintain alignment in policy suggestions, undertake action agendas to facilitate business competitiveness in the above areas and monitor outcomes. As the B20 recommendations are presented to the G-20 group, businesses of the world must take a key role in ensuring that our common global aspirations are catalysed to fruition.

### Conclusion

The B-20 Brazil Summit underscored the critical need for improving financial access, developing tailored credit solutions for SMEs, and advancing diversity and inclusion in the business world. These interconnected themes are vital for fostering sustainable economic growth and ensuring that all members of society, especially underrepresented groups and small businesses, have the opportunity to thrive. Through collaborative efforts between governments, businesses, and financial institutions, these challenges can be addressed to create a more inclusive and resilient global economy.

> At the 2024 B-20 Brazil Summit, key priorities included expanding **financial access**, developing **tailored credit solutions**, and advancing **diversity and inclusion** policies. Financial access aims to bring more individuals and businesses, especially in emerging markets, into the formal banking system, while tailored credit solutions focus on providing SMEs with flexible financing options to foster growth. Additionally, promoting diversity and inclusion in workplaces was emphasized as essential for innovation and productivity. The summit called for collaboration between governments, businesses, and financial institutions to address these issues, ensuring sustainable economic growth and opportunities for underrepresented groups.

# Governor vs Govt.

The relationship between the **Governor** and the **State Government** in India is a complex and often debated issue, especially given the unique constitutional framework under which they function. The Governor, as the nominal head of a state, is appointed by the President of India and holds office at the pleasure of the President. The role and powers of the Governor are defined in **Part VI of the Indian Constitution**, which outlines their duties and responsibilities as the constitutional link between the central and state governments.

### Governor’s Role and Powers

The Governor acts as the representative of the **President of India** in the state and is the constitutional head of the state government. However, the actual powers and decision-making authority lie with the **elected government**, headed by the **Chief Minister** and the **Council of Ministers**. In most cases, the Governor is expected to act on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers, as per **Article 163** of the Constitution. The Governor’s primary functions include:

1. **Appointing the Chief Minister**: The Governor appoints the Chief Minister of the state and, on the advice of the Chief Minister, appoints other members of the Council of Ministers.

2. **Summoning, Proroguing, and Dissolving the State Legislature**: The Governor has the power to summon or dissolve the state legislative assembly, but usually acts on the advice of the state government.

3. **Granting Assent to Bills**: After a bill is passed by the state legislature, it is sent to the Governor for assent. The Governor can either give assent, withhold it, return the bill for reconsideration, or, in some cases, refer it to the President of India for consideration.

4. **Discretionary Powers**: In specific situations, the Governor has discretionary powers, where they can act independently without the advice of the state government. These include deciding who should be invited to form the government in case of a hung assembly or submitting a report to the President if they believe there is a breakdown of constitutional machinery in the state, which could lead to the imposition of **President’s Rule** under **Article 356**.

### Governor vs. Government: Areas of Tension

While the Governor is constitutionally required to act on the advice of the state government, there are certain discretionary powers that have led to friction between the Governor and the state governments. These tensions typically arise in the following areas:

1. **Formation of Government**: After elections, especially in cases of a hung assembly where no party has a clear majority, the Governor’s discretion in inviting a party or alliance to form the government can become controversial. Allegations of partisanship have been made in cases where Governors are accused of favoring a particular party or delaying the swearing-in of elected representatives.

2. **Withholding Assent to Bills**: There have been instances where Governors have delayed or withheld assent to bills passed by the state legislature, often leading to conflicts with the elected government. The delay in granting assent can create a deadlock in the legislative process, particularly when the state government views it as an unnecessary or politically motivated intervention.

3. **Recommending President’s Rule**: The power to recommend the imposition of President’s Rule in a state is one of the most controversial aspects of the Governor’s role. Governors have, at times, been accused of misusing this power to dismiss duly elected governments or to destabilize state governments. The **S. R. Bommai case (1994)** was a landmark judgment by the Supreme Court, which limited the discretionary powers of the Governor in recommending President’s Rule and set guidelines for such actions.

4. **Interference in Day-to-Day Governance**: In some instances, there have been accusations that Governors interfere in the day-to-day functioning of the state government, particularly when the ruling party at the state level is different from the party at the center. Such interference can strain the relationship between the Governor and the Chief Minister, often leading to public confrontations.

### The Constitutional Balance

The Indian Constitution seeks to maintain a delicate balance between the role of the Governor and the authority of the elected state government. While the Governor is the constitutional head, the real executive authority rests with the elected government. The discretionary powers of the Governor are meant to be used sparingly and in situations where the constitutional machinery is at risk. The **Sarkaria Commission** and the **Punchhi Commission**, both of which examined the role of the Governor, emphasized the need for neutrality and non-partisanship in the functioning of the Governor.

### Conclusion

The relationship between the Governor and the state government is designed to function within the framework of federalism, with the Governor acting as a bridge between the state and the central government. However, this relationship can be strained when the actions of the Governor are perceived as politically motivated or overstepping constitutional boundaries. While the Governor has important constitutional responsibilities, it is essential for the office to function in harmony with the elected government, respecting the mandate of the people and ensuring the smooth functioning of democracy at the state level.

> The Governor, as the constitutional head of a state, represents the President and plays a nominal role in governance, while real authority lies with the elected state government led by the Chief Minister. Although the Governor generally acts on the advice of the state government, tensions can arise due to discretionary powers, such as forming governments in hung assemblies, withholding assent to bills, or recommending President’s Rule. These powers, if perceived as politically motivated, can strain relations between the Governor and the state government. A balance is necessary to ensure the Governor’s role complements the democratic functioning of state governments.

# Kalidas Samman award for artist Raghupathi Bhat

The Madhya Pradesh government has selected city-based artist Raghupathi Bhat for the prestigious Kalidas Samman award for the year 2023 for his contribution to the field of painting.
The award carries a cash prize of ₹5 lakh and a citation and will be conferred to Raghupathi Bhat at a function to be held in Ujjain on November 12.

**Raghupathi Bhat** is a renowned artist credited with reviving the ancient art of **Ganjifa miniature painting**, which was on the verge of extinction. Ganjifa is a traditional form of hand-painted playing cards that originated in Persia and was brought to India during the Mughal period. The cards were intricately designed, depicting mythological and historical themes, and were used for a variety of card games. Over time, this art form faded into obscurity, primarily due to the advent of mass-produced playing cards, and was nearly forgotten by the modern world.

Born in **Karnataka**, Raghupathi Bhat grew up with a deep interest in Indian art and culture. He learned about the Ganjifa tradition from local artisans and was moved by the intricate beauty and cultural significance of the paintings. However, he realized that the art form was on the brink of disappearance, as very few artists practiced it, and the knowledge was being lost with the passage of time. Determined to preserve this piece of India’s rich artistic heritage, Bhat made it his mission to revive Ganjifa painting.

Bhat’s efforts to breathe new life into this ancient art involved **meticulous research** into traditional techniques, styles, and themes. He studied ancient Ganjifa sets, learning about the iconography and stories depicted on the cards, which often featured Hindu gods, epic tales from the **Mahabharata** and **Ramayana**, and other mythological figures. His attention to detail and dedication to authentic reproduction allowed him to recreate the traditional Ganjifa cards with remarkable precision, while also innovating within the medium by introducing modern elements.

Beyond creating his own Ganjifa paintings, Bhat took a proactive role in **spreading awareness** about the art. He conducted workshops, exhibitions, and demonstrations to educate people about the history and techniques of Ganjifa painting. His efforts attracted the interest of art lovers, scholars, and collectors, helping to spark a renewed appreciation for this once-forgotten art form.

Thanks to Raghupathi Bhat's dedication, Ganjifa miniature painting has seen a revival, and its cultural significance has been preserved for future generations. His work has not only safeguarded a unique artistic tradition but has also inspired new generations of artists to learn and practice Ganjifa, ensuring its continued existence in the modern world.
