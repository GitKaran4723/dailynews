# What challenges does India face in fertilizer imports?

India faces significant challenges in the import and production of fertilizers, given the critical role they play in the country’s agricultural sector, which supports nearly half of India’s population. Fertilizers are essential to maintaining agricultural productivity and ensuring food security, but India’s reliance on imports and various production constraints complicate this effort. These challenges range from dependence on foreign sources, high subsidies, and pricing volatility to environmental and infrastructural issues.

### 1. **High Dependence on Imports**
   - India imports approximately 25% of its total fertilizer requirement, with key imports being potash, phosphates, and raw materials for nitrogenous fertilizers. The dependence on imports makes India vulnerable to global price fluctuations and supply chain disruptions, as seen recently due to geopolitical tensions like the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which has led to increased prices and scarcity in global fertilizer markets.
   - Specifically, India imports about 90% of its potash and 60% of its phosphate needs, mostly from countries like Canada, Russia, and Belarus. This dependency means any changes in trade relationships, sanctions, or supply issues can severely impact domestic availability and pricing.

### 2. **Rising Global Fertilizer Prices**
   - Fluctuating global fertilizer prices strain India’s budget since the government provides heavy subsidies to keep fertilizers affordable for farmers. In recent years, prices of raw materials and finished fertilizers have increased significantly due to factors like rising energy costs and global supply disruptions, increasing the financial burden on the government.
   - For example, after the Russia-Ukraine war, prices of ammonia, urea, and potash spiked. As a result, India's subsidy bill surged, adding to fiscal pressures. These subsidies are critical to supporting farmers, but they also impact India’s economy by diverting funds from other development projects.

### 3. **Subsidy and Fiscal Burden**
   - Fertilizer subsidies are among the largest expenditure items in India’s budget, with over ₹1.75 lakh crore spent annually. While subsidies make fertilizers affordable, they also encourage overuse, leading to soil degradation and water contamination. Additionally, the rising cost of these subsidies strains India’s fiscal resources and limits budget allocation for other critical sectors.
   - The subsidy model also incentivizes fertilizer companies to focus on supplying subsidized products rather than investing in innovation or producing balanced fertilizers that better suit crop needs.

### 4. **Environmental and Soil Health Concerns**
   - Over-reliance on nitrogen-based fertilizers, such as urea, has degraded soil health and reduced productivity in the long run. Indian soils are experiencing nutrient imbalances, particularly due to excessive urea usage, which depletes essential micronutrients and deteriorates soil structure.
   - Excessive fertilizer use has also led to water contamination, causing nitrate pollution that affects both ecosystems and human health. Balancing soil health with fertilizer requirements is a pressing issue, yet complex to address given the incentives built into the subsidy system for certain types of fertilizers.

### 5. **Production and Capacity Constraints**
   - India’s fertilizer production capacity has not kept pace with rising demand. Although the government has encouraged domestic production, existing plants struggle with outdated technology, limited access to raw materials, and frequent shutdowns for maintenance.
   - The dependency on imported raw materials for domestic fertilizer production, especially phosphoric acid and potash, hampers self-reliance in the sector. Although recent investments have been made to increase production capacity, infrastructure and logistic challenges persist, slowing growth in domestic production.

### 6. **Infrastructure and Logistics Challenges**
   - Distribution and transportation infrastructure for fertilizers is often inadequate, resulting in delays, higher costs, and uneven supply across states. The lack of efficient storage facilities also causes post-production losses, further affecting the timely availability of fertilizers.
   - Ports, rail networks, and warehousing facilities are often overburdened, especially during peak agricultural seasons. These logistical issues increase costs and make it harder to maintain a consistent fertilizer supply, disproportionately impacting farmers in remote or underserved areas.

### 7. **Policy and Regulatory Challenges**
   - The fertilizer sector in India is heavily regulated, with pricing controls and stringent subsidies. While these controls make fertilizers affordable, they also discourage private investments and innovation in the sector.
   - Additionally, slow bureaucratic processes often delay the release of subsidies to fertilizer companies, which affects their cash flow and, in turn, impacts production and distribution. Complex regulatory hurdles, combined with subsidy dependence, limit the ability of companies to adapt to changing market conditions.

### 8. **Balancing Import Dependence and Self-Reliance**
   - The Indian government has been pursuing “Atmanirbhar Bharat” (self-reliant India) policies, including efforts to reduce dependence on imported fertilizers. However, reducing imports will require massive investments in domestic production, new technologies, and alternative nutrient sources, which are challenging to implement quickly.
   - Developing indigenous production capabilities, such as rock phosphate mining and processing, is essential but time-consuming and costly. Balancing immediate needs with long-term strategies for self-reliance remains a significant challenge for India’s fertilizer sector.

### Conclusion
India's fertilizer sector faces multifaceted challenges that hinder both import and production efforts. Dependence on global suppliers, rising costs, fiscal burdens of subsidies, environmental impacts, and infrastructural limitations all pose significant obstacles. Addressing these issues requires a balanced approach that encourages self-reliance while ensuring affordability and sustainability. Investment in research, policy reforms, and infrastructural improvements are crucial to meeting India’s growing agricultural demands and fostering a more sustainable and resilient fertilizer ecosystem.

> India faces significant challenges in fertilizer imports and production, impacting agriculture and food security. Heavy dependence on imports for potash and phosphates makes India vulnerable to global price fluctuations, exacerbated by recent geopolitical tensions. Rising global prices and subsidies strain fiscal resources, while overuse of subsidized nitrogen-based fertilizers harms soil health and water quality. Domestic production lags due to capacity, infrastructure, and raw material constraints. Inadequate distribution infrastructure and stringent regulations add further obstacles. While India aims for self-reliance, achieving it requires investment in domestic production, innovative technologies, and balanced policies to ensure affordability, sustainability, and reliable supply.

# The burgeoning expenditure of elections

The total expenditure for U.S. presidential and Congressional elections in November 2024 is estimated at around U.S. $16 billion (equivalent to ₹1,36,000 crores). According to the Centre for Media Studies (CMS), the total expenditure by various political parties for the general election to Lok Sabha this year was around ₹1,00,000 crores.

What are the limits in India?

The election expenditure limit for candidates is ₹95 lakh per Lok Sabha constituency in larger States and ₹75 lakh in smaller States. With respect to Legislative Assemblies, they are ₹40 lakh and ₹28 lakh for larger and smaller States respectively. These limits are set, from time to time, by the Election Commission (EC). There are no limits on the expenditure of political parties during elections.

What are international standards?

In the U.S., the financing for elections happens primarily by contributions from individuals, corporations, and political action committees (PAC). While there are limits on individual and PAC contributions to candidates, various judgments of the U.S. Supreme Court have resulted in the creation of Super PACs on which there are no limits for spending. Out of the estimated expenditure in the November 2024 election cycle, around $5.5 billion is estimated to be spent on the presidential election. The balance is around $10.5 billion on elections to the House of Representatives and Senate of the U.S. Congress. This humungous raise is due to large donations by organisational donors and Super PACs.

In the U.K., a political party is allowed to spend £54,010 for each constituency they contest. This translates to a limit of £35 million for parties contesting all constituencies. There are also limits placed on candidates’ spending during the campaign period. It translates, per constituency, to an average of £46-49,000 during the long campaign period (beginning five months before the full term of the House of Commons ends) and £17-20,000 during the short campaign period after elections are announced.

What are the challenges?

Elections across the world democracies have become very expensive. Such increased expenditure that is met primarily through large donations creates an unholy nexus between the elected representatives and donors who seek favours. This acts as an entry barrier into electoral politics for many well-meaning citizens.

In India, candidates from all major political parties breach the election expenditure limits by a wide margin. Further, there are no limits on political party spending during elections. The official expenditures declared by the BJP and Congress for the 2019 election were ₹1,264 crores and ₹820 crores, respectively. However, according to a report by the CMS, ₹50,000 crore was spent by various parties during the 2019 election.

The report suggests that 35% of this money was spent on campaigns and publicity, while 25% was illegally distributed among voters. The CMS has estimated that spending during the 2024 election by various political parties was close to ₹1,00,000 crores. Such inflated election expenditure fuels corruption, resulting in a vicious cycle.

What can be possible reforms?

The Indrajit Gupta Committee (1998) and the Law Commission report (1999) have advocated for State funding of elections. This would mean the government partially bears the election expenditures of candidates nominated by recognised political parties. However, the feasibility and mechanism for implementing this measure are doubtful in the present context.

Simultaneous elections are touted as a panacea for addressing the issue of rising election expenditures. There are challenges on account of principles of federalism and constitutional amendments to this idea that need to be debated. It must also be noted that this mechanism may rein in campaign and publicity expenditure to some extent. However, without curbing the illegal distribution of cash to voters, any form of simultaneous election will not have a significant impact on election expenditure.

In this regard, certain practical steps to create a level playing field regarding election expenditure can be implemented if there is political will. These are based on the EC’s 2016 report on ‘Proposed Electoral Reforms.’. Firstly, the law must be amended to explicitly provide that ‘financial assistance’ by a political party to its candidate should also be within the candidate's prescribed election expenditure limits. Secondly, there should be a ceiling on political party expenditures. This may be kept at not more than the expenditure ceiling limit provided for a candidate multiplied by the number of candidates of the party contesting the election. Finally, additional judges may be appointed in High Courts for the speedy disposal of election-related cases, which would act as a deterrent against violating these norms. These reforms would require bipartisan political support and need to be expeditiously implemented.

> The estimated expenditure for the 2024 U.S. presidential and Congressional elections is around $16 billion (₹1,36,000 crores). In comparison, political parties in India spent approximately ₹1,00,000 crores on the recent Lok Sabha elections, as reported by the Centre for Media Studies. In India, election expenditure limits are imposed on individual candidates but not on political parties. Candidates can spend up to ₹95 lakh per constituency in larger states and ₹75 lakh in smaller states for Lok Sabha elections. For Legislative Assemblies, limits are ₹40 lakh and ₹28 lakh, respectively, and are periodically revised by the Election Commission.

# Cyclical slowdown? Nomura thinks so

India's economy is facing a cyclical growth slowdown, with Nomura economists Sonal Varma and Aurodeep Nandi projecting that growth could dip below 6.7% due to emerging economic risks. In their recent analysis, the economists highlighted that weakening urban demand, high interest rates, and moderate wage growth are pressing concerns. Despite the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) forecasting a more optimistic 7.2% growth rate for 2024-25, Nomura suggests this may be overly ambitious, as key indicators signal further economic moderation.

### Key Factors Contributing to the Slowdown

1. **Weakening Urban Demand**: Urban consumption has softened in recent months, reflecting a notable shift in consumer spending patterns. This weakness, Nomura suggests, is likely to persist due to a combination of factors:
   - **Reduced Real Wage Growth**: Nomura’s analysis points to lower-than-expected real salary increases, which affects purchasing power and dampens consumer spending. The high inflation rates have eroded wage growth in real terms, meaning that even those who receive nominal raises find their purchasing power stagnant or reduced.
   - **Fading Pent-Up Demand**: Post-pandemic pent-up demand, which fueled a temporary boost in consumption, is gradually dissipating. With most deferred purchases now fulfilled, consumption patterns are returning to pre-pandemic levels, resulting in a natural moderation in demand.
   - **High Interest Rates**: Tight credit conditions, fueled by persistently high interest rates, are limiting access to consumer loans and mortgages, restricting urban spending on large purchases, including real estate and consumer durables.

2. **Cyclical Growth Slowdown**: Nomura categorizes the current economic deceleration as cyclical, suggesting that it is part of the natural ebb and flow of economic activity. While some slowdown is inherent in economic cycles, emerging global and domestic risks are likely to amplify this deceleration:
   - **Global Economic Uncertainty**: The global economic environment is experiencing high volatility, with factors like inflation, geopolitical tensions, and recession fears in developed economies contributing to a slowdown. India, as an emerging market, is impacted by these global shifts, which can affect exports, investment flows, and overall economic confidence.
   - **Supply Chain Disruptions**: Supply chain bottlenecks, though improving, continue to pose a challenge, affecting production and consumption patterns. Nomura anticipates that external supply chain uncertainties, combined with domestic challenges, may impact India’s growth trajectory.

3. **Moderation in GDP Growth Forecasts**: With economic indicators pointing towards slower growth, Nomura projects GDP growth at 6.7% for the current fiscal year, slightly below its prior estimates. For the following year, 2025-26, a slight recovery to 6.8% is anticipated. However, these projections come with rising downside risks:
   - **Potential External Shocks**: As a globally integrated economy, India is susceptible to external shocks, such as oil price volatility or changes in global financial markets. Any significant adverse change in global economic conditions could further dampen growth.
   - **Domestic Structural Constraints**: Persistent issues such as underdeveloped infrastructure, labor market rigidity, and insufficient investments in sectors like manufacturing and agriculture continue to hold back India’s growth potential. Without significant reforms, these structural constraints may exacerbate the cyclical slowdown.

4. **Inflationary Pressures and Policy Implications**: Although inflation has shown signs of moderation, it remains a point of concern for policy makers, as high inflation can erode consumer purchasing power and impede economic growth. The RBI’s stance on interest rates will play a crucial role in determining India’s growth outlook. If interest rates remain high to curb inflation, it could further depress urban demand and restrict economic expansion.

5. **Employment and Income Concerns**: Moderating wage growth and limited real income improvements could affect India’s large labor force. Many sectors, particularly in urban settings, are experiencing a slowdown in hiring, contributing to reduced consumer confidence and spending. With weaker job creation, urban areas may continue to see slower demand growth.

### Looking Forward

India’s growth story is still fundamentally strong, backed by its demographic dividend, burgeoning middle class, and structural economic reforms. However, the cyclical slowdown suggests that short-term growth prospects could be lower than anticipated. To counter the downturn, targeted fiscal measures, infrastructural investments, and monetary policies that balance inflation control with growth support may be required. Boosting sectors like infrastructure, technology, and renewable energy could also provide growth opportunities and create employment.

### Conclusion

India’s economy faces cyclical and structural challenges that threaten its growth trajectory. Nomura’s forecast underscores the need for balanced policy measures to sustain growth while addressing emerging risks. With cautious optimism, structural reforms, and supportive fiscal policies, India can work through this cyclical downturn and stabilize its growth prospects, enabling it to better navigate a rapidly changing global economy.

> India's economy is experiencing a cyclical growth slowdown, with Nomura economists projecting growth below 6.7% amid weak urban demand, high interest rates, and moderate wage growth. Key challenges include reduced real wage increases, fading post-pandemic demand, and restricted credit access, affecting urban spending. Nomura suggests the RBI’s 7.2% growth forecast may be overly optimistic as global economic uncertainties and supply chain issues persist. The forecast highlights potential downside risks from global shocks and domestic constraints. To navigate this period, balanced policy measures, targeted fiscal support, and structural reforms are essential for sustaining growth and addressing emerging risks.

# Justice K.S. Puttaswamy, a champion of privacy who challenged Aadhaar, dead

Justice K.S. Puttaswamy, known for his significant contribution to privacy rights in India, particularly through his challenge to Aadhaar, has passed away. His landmark case, *Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) vs. Union of India*, led to the historic 2017 Supreme Court ruling that established the right to privacy as a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution. This judgment has profound implications for individual freedom and autonomy in a rapidly digitalizing India.

### Significance of the Right to Privacy

1. **Foundation of Personal Liberty**: The right to privacy empowers individuals to make personal decisions without undue interference, safeguarding dignity and personal autonomy. It protects personal choices, family life, and sexual orientation, thus enriching personal liberty under Article 21.

2. **Protection of Data and Personal Information**: As India undergoes digital transformation, personal data collection by government and private entities has skyrocketed. Recognizing privacy as a fundamental right has prompted the development of data protection laws (like the Data Protection Bill) to regulate data handling practices and protect individuals from misuse.

3. **Limiting State Surveillance**: The right to privacy ensures checks and balances on government power, limiting state surveillance to cases where it’s necessary and proportionate. It prevents arbitrary intrusions into private lives, safeguarding democratic rights.

4. **Safeguarding Digital Rights**: In the digital age, where Aadhaar and other biometric-based systems are widely used, privacy rights prevent unauthorized access and misuse of personal data, enhancing security for individuals while interacting with online services.

5. **Strengthening Judicial Precedents for Human Rights**: The Puttaswamy judgment has established a robust legal foundation, allowing courts to uphold citizens' rights against both government actions and private infringements, shaping future laws on individual freedoms and rights.

6. **Impact on Social Justice**: Privacy rights contribute to social justice by protecting marginalized groups, ensuring non-discrimination, and allowing individuals to live freely without societal pressures, which is essential for an inclusive society.

### Legacy of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy

Justice Puttaswamy's legacy goes beyond privacy. His efforts have strengthened the legal framework for individual rights, instilling awareness and creating safeguards for digital and physical privacy. This legal recognition of privacy as a fundamental right is a cornerstone in India's journey toward respecting human dignity, autonomy, and personal freedom.

> Justice K.S. Puttaswamy, who famously challenged Aadhaar, secured a landmark 2017 Supreme Court ruling that established privacy as a fundamental right under Article 21. This decision has far-reaching implications for personal freedom, data protection, and limits on state surveillance in India. Recognizing privacy as essential to personal liberty, it safeguards individual choices and prevents arbitrary intrusion. The ruling strengthens digital rights, encourages data protection laws, and promotes social justice by protecting marginalized groups. Justice Puttaswamy’s legacy highlights the importance of privacy in upholding dignity, autonomy, and democratic rights in an increasingly digital world.

# Solar, a game changer in women’s empowerment

Until Charles Fritts installed the first rooftop photovoltaic solar array using 1%-efficient selenium cells on a roof in New York City in 1884, the sun was a humble driving force behind photosynthesis, evaporation, and countless natural processes. Today, apart from being the major factor in the climate patterns that sustains life on earth, it is also a transformative, democratising force in electricity generation. Distinct from traditional sources such as coal, oil, gas, nuclear, and hydropower, which require extensive infrastructure and intermediary transmission lines, solar energy can now be harnessed directly at its point of use — in homes. It is now a home product.

### The impact of decentralisation

Decentralisation of power generation has significant implications for both environmental sustainability and societal structures. The ability to generate energy close to where it is consumed unlocks a cascade of benefits beyond mere convenience. Socially, economically, and developmentally, solar places power — literally and figuratively — into the hands of individuals and communities, breaking down barriers that have long excluded them from the energy economy. This shift empowers people, particularly women, making them direct participants in the economy and catalysts for change.

Women often bear the brunt of poor energy access, impacting their health, safety, and economic potential. Solar addresses this. In Gujarat’s Little Rann of Kutch, women salt farmers have transitioned from expensive diesel to solar pumps, boosting their income by 94% and reducing CO2 emissions by up to 1,15,000 metric tons annually. Initiatives such as the Barefoot College (India), the Grameen Shakti (Bangladesh), and Solar Sister (Africa) empower women to become solar engineers, benefiting millions and improving community health and safety. For example, We Care Solar’s suitcases reduced perinatal deaths by 72% in Uganda’s health centres.

Solar, especially through localised solutions, is advancing women’s financial inclusion and enabling income generation directed towards education, health care, and other essential activities. By integrating women across the value chain — from end-users to entrepreneurs — solar is driving societal progress and elevating the status of women. In fact, solar employs more women than any other energy sector. In 2022, the solar photovoltaic industry alone provided jobs to around 4.9 million people, with women accounting for 40% of the workforce. With India’s ambitious renewable targets, the sector is expected to create three million new jobs by 2030, offering significant opportunities for women if the current trends hold. No other energy project comes close to this potential.

### Clean and scalable but there are challenges

Solar also uplifts marginalised communities. Unlike coal, which has impoverished resource-rich regions, solar offers a sustainable path forward. India’s coal mining districts exemplify the ‘resource curse’, where local communities suffer from poor health, education, and living conditions, with over 50% in poverty.

Distributed solar systems link energy production with community well-being, driving climate resilience. Off-grid projects provide clean energy to areas without traditional electricity, supporting economic development in rural regions. Rooftop installations and mini-grids offer scalable, eco-friendly solutions, creating local jobs without the environmental impact of large-scale projects.

Effective community engagement is crucial for the success of these projects. For instance, in India, formalised community institutions such as self-help groups, farmer-producer organisations, and panchayati raj institutions are integral to village infrastructure planning. Where formal structures are absent, rural energy committees can oversee mini-grid operations, encompassing everything from planning and installation to tariff determination and maintenance, which ensure that energy access is thorough and benefits the entire community.

As solar technology progresses, three challenges persist: geographical imbalance, with most investments concentrated in developed nations leaving developing countries, particularly Africa, lagging; sectoral imbalance is evident as large-scale solar farms receive the majority of funding while smaller, crucial applications such as solar pumps and cold storages are overlooked; manufacturing concentration in just two countries disrupts supply chains and inflates prices, a problem set to intensify with rising global demand. The challenge at the home level will be to ensure easy availability and affordability of solar. This will require robust government and market support.

The second is to focus on the life cycle of solar technologies, with an emphasis on recycling and circularity to manage waste. Establishing clear guidelines for processing solar photovoltaic materials is vital, ensuring that they contribute to sustainability rather than exacerbate waste issues. A robust framework should mandate producer responsibility and involve government and end-of-life management collaboration, fostering efficient recycling and encouraging recyclability. Additionally, exploring mobile recycling plants and implementing stringent waste management processes are crucial for enhancing the environmental and economic health of the solar sector.

### Policies and gender

A just energy transition is more than a shift from fossil fuels to renewables. It is about ensuring that all communities, especially those historically sidelined, benefit from the change. For solar energy to truly empower communities, it must be inclusive and equitable, positioning women not just as beneficiaries but also as pivotal change agents. This necessitates a re-evaluation of energy policies through a gender lens.

Current national-level electricity access policies often lack this perspective, limiting their effectiveness in combating inequality. It is crucial for electrification initiatives to integrate with sectors such as agriculture, forestry, and rural development to form a holistic approach to energy access. This integration helps to dismantle the systemic barriers that disproportionately affect women, fostering a more inclusive energy economy. With this, we can ensure that solar supports environmental sustainability, drives socio-economic development, and becomes a true catalyst for a liveable planet.

Solar energy is emerging as a powerful tool for women’s empowerment, especially in regions where traditional energy sources are scarce or unreliable. By providing clean, affordable, and sustainable energy, solar power supports women’s access to education, health, economic opportunities, and decision-making in households and communities. Its impact is transformative, particularly in rural and remote areas, where access to energy has traditionally been limited.

One of the most direct ways solar power empowers women is by reducing the time and physical effort spent on traditional, labor-intensive energy sources, such as collecting firewood or relying on kerosene lamps. With access to solar-powered lights and appliances, women can better manage household chores, freeing up time for education, income-generating activities, or even relaxation. Access to reliable lighting enables women to study in the evening or engage in small businesses, such as sewing or handicrafts, beyond daylight hours, leading to economic independence and skill development.

Health benefits are another significant aspect of solar energy’s role in women’s empowerment. Traditional energy sources, like burning wood or kerosene, produce harmful indoor air pollution, affecting respiratory health, especially for women and children who spend more time indoors. Solar energy eliminates this hazard, creating healthier environments that reduce medical expenses and improve overall well-being. Healthier women can contribute more effectively to their families and communities, strengthening their societal roles and impact.

Solar-powered water pumps and appliances are transforming agricultural practices, where women often play central roles. By easing access to irrigation and allowing for crop diversification, solar technology enables women farmers to increase agricultural productivity and income, creating sustainable livelihoods and fostering economic stability in communities. Additionally, as solar technology gains traction, women have opportunities to be trained as solar technicians or entrepreneurs, setting up and maintaining solar systems in their villages. This technical skill development not only boosts their earning potential but also challenges traditional gender roles, positioning women as leaders in the energy sector.

On a broader scale, solar energy is changing power dynamics within households and communities. When women contribute to household energy resources through solar initiatives, their influence over family decisions and financial matters increases. This shift strengthens their status in the community, promoting gender equality and more inclusive decision-making.

In summary, solar energy is more than an energy solution—it is a vehicle for women’s empowerment. By facilitating access to education, health, economic opportunities, and leadership roles, solar power is transforming lives, fostering gender equality, and driving sustainable development, particularly for women in under-resourced areas.

> Solar energy empowers women by providing clean, affordable energy, especially in underserved areas. By reducing reliance on traditional energy sources like firewood and kerosene, solar energy saves women time, supports health, and allows for evening activities, fostering education and income opportunities. It enhances agricultural productivity through solar-powered water pumps, enabling women farmers to increase income and sustainable livelihoods. Training women as solar technicians further builds skills, promoting gender equality and leadership. Solar energy’s benefits extend to household dynamics, increasing women’s influence in family and community decisions. Ultimately, solar energy is a transformative tool for women’s empowerment and sustainable development.

# Cabinet clears new tourism policy

Karnataka’s new tourism policy, approved by the State Cabinet, aims to significantly enhance both domestic and international tourism over the next five years, propelling the state into the top tier of tourism destinations in India. The policy, to be implemented until 2029, has ambitious goals: it seeks to boost domestic tourist numbers from approximately 28 crore to around 48 crore annually, and international tourist arrivals from 4 lakh to 20 lakh per year. The framework aligns with the broader objective of contributing to Karnataka’s economic growth, particularly its target of achieving a $1 trillion economy by 2032. 

As it stands, Karnataka attracts nearly 10% of all tourist visits within India, securing the fourth position among Indian states in terms of tourist numbers. Yet, it lags in international appeal, not ranking within the top five states for foreign tourist arrivals. Tourism Minister H. K. Patil highlighted this challenge and expressed the state's ambition to break into the top three states for domestic tourism while establishing Karnataka as a prominent destination for international visitors as well. This policy is a structured approach to making Karnataka a major player in Indian tourism, targeting significant improvements to infrastructure, tourism services, and marketing initiatives.

The vision outlined in the policy indicates a strong intent to diversify Karnataka’s tourism offerings, leveraging the state’s cultural, historical, and natural wealth. Karnataka is home to diverse attractions, from heritage sites like Hampi and the Mysore Palace to nature destinations such as Coorg, Chikmagalur, and Bandipur. By improving connectivity to these attractions, particularly in rural and remote areas, and upgrading facilities for tourists, the government intends to create a more welcoming and accessible environment for visitors.

Moreover, the policy underscores the importance of sustainable tourism, ensuring that the economic benefits of tourism growth extend to local communities without compromising environmental conservation. There is an emphasis on developing ecotourism, cultural tourism, and wellness tourism, reflecting a global trend toward more immersive, experiential travel. To achieve these objectives, the government plans to work closely with private sector partners, encouraging investment in hotels, resorts, and other tourism-related infrastructure.

Data from the policy highlights Karnataka's steady rise in tourism. Domestic tourist numbers have seen substantial growth over recent years, rising from 36.7 million in 2006 to 283.5 million in 2023, which underscores a nearly eight-fold increase. Foreign tourist arrivals, though still relatively low at 4.01 lakh in 2024, indicate room for growth, particularly with targeted strategies to enhance Karnataka's international appeal. Initiatives could include more aggressive international marketing, better connectivity through increased flights, and relaxed visa processes to attract a higher volume of foreign tourists.

To monitor progress, the government is likely to establish benchmarks and implement data-driven decision-making, using tourist feedback and visitation statistics to adjust and optimize the policy’s impact over time. Investments in digital platforms to assist tourists, training programs for local hospitality providers, and stronger partnerships with travel agencies are expected to be part of the action plan.

In summary, Karnataka’s tourism policy is both ambitious and strategic, positioning tourism as a catalyst for economic development. With these goals, the state government envisions Karnataka not just as a must-visit destination for domestic travelers but as an internationally recognized tourism hub by 2029. The successful execution of this policy could substantially contribute to Karnataka’s economic and social development, enhancing its profile on both the national and international tourism maps.

Here are key points regarding Karnataka’s New Tourism Policy (2024-2029):

1. **Increased Tourist Targets**: Aim to raise domestic tourist visits from 28 crore to 48 crore annually and foreign tourist visits from 4 lakh to 20 lakh by 2029.

2. **Top Tourism Destination**: Goal to position Karnataka among the top three states in India for domestic tourism and improve its rank in foreign tourist arrivals.

3. **Economic Contribution**: Tourism seen as a catalyst for achieving Karnataka’s $1 trillion economy target by 2032.

4. **Enhanced Infrastructure**: Plans to develop infrastructure in key tourist locations, especially in remote areas, to improve accessibility and facilities.

# The under-representation of women in the judiciary

The absence of women in the judicial system, which is glaring and widely discussed, almost always revolves around entry-level measures that are aimed at ensuring that more women enter the profession as lawyers/ judges. While such entry-level measures are necessary, it is crucial to recognise that this is insufficient to ensure the continued support and encouragement and retention of women in the judiciary.

The Supreme Court of India’s “State of the Judiciary” report (2023) showed 36.3% of women in the district judiciary, which is heartening. In 14 States, more than 50% of candidates successfully recruited into the civil judge (junior) division were women. However, at the higher levels, the representation of women in the judiciary falls short. As of January 2024, only 13.4% of judges in the High Court and 9.3% judges in the Supreme Court are women. Further, the representation of women is uneven across High Courts, with States which include Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Manipur, Meghalaya, Odisha, Tripura and Uttarakhand having either no women judges or just one woman judge.

The situation in the Bar is also bleak. Data published by the Department of Legal Affairs in 2022 show that approximately 15.31% of all enrolled advocates are women. Although comprehensive data in this regard has not been made public by all State Bar Councils, women are drastically under-represented as senior advocates, advocates-on-record, and Bar Council representatives. This results in a funnel effect, creating a smaller pool of candidates who may be able to establish themselves in the system and be considered for elevation.

### Policy gaps

The under-representation of women in the judiciary is part of a vicious cycle. Women are excluded while even those women who have been included are unable to rise to positions of power to address these concerns. Access for women in the judiciary, therefore, is hindered at two levels: entry and retention.

While several States have taken commendable steps in ensuring that women enter the lower levels of the judiciary, direct recruitment continues to be a challenge for female aspirants. The Judicial Service Rules of many States stipulate that advocates must have a minimum period of ‘continuous’ practice for elevation to the Bench. For women advocates who are required to juggle family responsibilities in the absence of maternity benefits and minimum stipends, meeting this threshold is difficult.

However, even when women have managed to enter the system, continued career growth becomes difficult in the face of a discouraging and unsupportive environment which fails to take into account their specific needs. There is a continuously diminishing pool of women judges eligible for elevation to the High Court, and eventually the Supreme Court. This reverse funnel effect is caused by transfer policies which are often harsh and demanding, leaving little room for negotiation or sensitivity towards women’s continued responsibilities as primary caretakers in the household.

Every day interactions within courts also cause difficulties for women lawyers, judges and staff working in the judiciary, due to the absence of basic infrastructural requirements. A survey in 2019, by the Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy highlighted that nearly 100 district courts have no dedicated washrooms for women. Multiple courts, including prominent High Courts, lack adequate washrooms even for women judges, let alone for female staff, lawyers, or litigants. There are only limited sanitary facilities and hygienic waste disposal systems. The burden of familial responsibilities continues to be the social reality of women in India. With women expected to be primary caretakers, courts must provide family-friendly amenities including feeding rooms and crèches. However, although some courts have taken steps in this regard, the limited availability of resources results in restrictions which render them ineffective. For example, the Delhi High Court’s crèche only caters to children younger than six years.

### Need for course correction

It is quite intuitive from the issues above that the twin threshold of entry and retention of women in judiciary as equal stakeholders to access is important, but the solutions have been instituted in silos. The main consequence is that the problem persists as there are fewer women represented in the higher echelons of the judiciary, and far fewer amenities that enable their access to court complexes for their continued retention in the justice delivery system.

This is a classic problem of the ever-widening public-private divide espoused by Carole Pateman in her theory wherein she points out that as women increasingly entered the public sphere traditionally occupied by men, there was a lag in the laws as well. She further elaborates that this public-private divide is the main reason why the public sphere does not cater to the specific needs of women upon their transition from the private sphere to the public. This theory can be extended to the design and regulation of the public sphere as well, which is usually not a conducive environment for women to thrive and feel safe.

Similarly, it is important to acknowledge that as more women enter courts which have been male-dominant institutions for a long time now, it is all the more necessary to employ a female gaze to implement inclusive policies to enable their entry and retention. Simply put, the female gaze in implementation means the employment of a feminist lens to recognise the differential needs of women and course-correct to diminish the unintended impacts of neutral-yet indirectly discriminatory policies and infrastructural mandates. The employment of a female gaze breaks the male standard view employed by an all-male administrative committee of judges or all-male Bar Councils, particularly in cases where there is no women representation. This helps further in an inclusive visualisation of how ‘public spaces’ — in this case, courts and their access — are constructed, aiding in the construction of a lens through which gendered impact of policies and mandates can be filtered to enable the entry and retention of women in courts.

### Prioritising women’s needs

Greater participation of women in the judiciary must be driven by women-centric perspectives, which identify specific issues hindering future career growth and progress.

Former judge, Justice Hima Kohli, one of the few women judges in the Supreme Court recently noted the unconscious gender bias in courts which results in women judges being sidelined in administrative duties. This is highlighted by the fact that according to information published on High Court websites, none of the High Court Building Committees aside from Delhi, Allahabad and Himachal Pradesh currently has even a single woman judge as a member. Infrastructure needs for women are often de-prioritised as a result, with ad hoc decisions such as the construction of a single toilet block or a temporary waste disposal bin being insufficient to address women’s needs.

Similarly, in the absence of adequate representation in High Court Registries and judicial academies, women’s perspectives and experiences for policy-making, addressing bias through gender-sensitisation training are not fully taken into account.

A female-centric gaze would recognise and prioritise the needs of women and allow for greater support within the judiciary. Taking the lived experiences and realities of women into account would ensure that women’s needs are no longer invisibilised during policy-making. Infrastructural amenities, gender-sensitive recruitment and transfer policies, and adequate training and support are crucial to ensure that the judiciary lives up to its promise of empowering women.

> Women’s representation in India’s judiciary is limited, particularly in higher courts, with only **13.4% of High Court judges** and **9.3% of Supreme Court judges** being women as of early 2024. While women comprise **36.3% of district judges**, their numbers drop significantly at senior levels. States like Bihar and Jharkhand have minimal to no female judges in their High Courts. The legal profession also shows gender imbalance; only **15.31% of advocates** are women, affecting the pool available for elevation. Addressing this gap requires measures beyond entry-level recruitment, such as mentorship programs, gender-sensitive policies, and promotions to senior roles.

# Tackling learning disabilities head-on

Picture a classroom where a student, eager to learn, raises their hand. As they begin to speak, their words come out haltingly, thoughts struggling to take shape. The teacher, pressed for time, gently moves on to another student. In that moment, more than just words are lost. Half-formed ideas retreat, clarity slips away, and with it, a crucial opportunity for learning is lost.

### A deeper truth

This struggle is not just about communication; it is about the very process of forming and articulating ideas. Each interruption of an attempt doesn’t just silence a voice; it stunts the growth of thoughts. In the rapid flow of classroom discourse, these students fall behind in speaking, in thinking, in understanding, in learning itself. In classrooms across India, this scene highlights a deeper truth: learning disabilities are far more complex than we often recognise. They don’t just involve reading or writing, but affect how students think, process, and engage with the world. Recent data suggest that 8-15% of schoolgoing children in India (50 million children) have been reported to have some form of learning disability. The challenges they face are often misunderstood. **The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016** officially recognises **‘specific learning disabilities’** among 21 categories, but most schools aren’t equipped to handle them.

Take **dyslexia**, for instance. It is not just about mixing up letters. It is about a brain that processes language differently, affecting not just reading but also comprehension, memory, and even social interactions. **Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)**, often dismissed as restlessness, is a complex disorder impacting attention and impulse control. Our education system, built for neurotypical students, often fails to meet diverse needs. Studies show most teachers lack the training or experience to teach in an inclusive manner, especially in rural India. The COVID-19 pandemic worsened the situation, as many teachers were unprepared to support students with learning disabilities online. The recent story of Radhika, a student with multiple learning disabilities who scored 97% in her CBSE exams, is exceptional. Yet, for every Radhika, countless students remain unsupported — not because they cannot learn, but because we haven’t adapted how we teach to meet the needs of such students. Students with unaddressed learning disabilities often internalise a sense of failure. They are not “lazy” or “stupid’; their brains simply work differently. Without proper support, they may never uncover their true potential. A study published in the Indian Journal of Psychiatry found that children with specific learning disabilities experience significantly higher rates of anxiety and depression compared to their peers. They battle mental health issues in silence, unable to express what they can’t fully understand. The government’s announcement of a diagnostic test for adult learning disabilities is a positive step. However, real change will happen only when we train our teachers. **B.Ed programmes** must focus on neurodiversity and adaptive teaching methods. While the **National Education Policy (NEP), 2020,** has set standards, the challenge is to turn them into practical classroom strategies.

### The way forward

To tackle learning disabilities head-on, we must develop comprehensive programmes that emphasise early identification and intervention, using screening tools and evidence-based methods tailored to India’s needs. Countries such as Finland excel in identifying and supporting students from a young age, but India faces unique hurdles due to its size. Promising steps have indeed been taken, such as the **22 Cross-Disability Early Intervention Centres (CDEIC)**. Kerala’s early intervention initiatives, though focused on hearing impairments, show the potential for broader support systems.

Technology is another key factor. Tools like text-to-speech software and AI-powered learning aids can level the playing field. Initiatives such as **PM e-Vidya, DIKSHA, and e-Pathshala under the Digital India framework, supported by NEP 2020**, aim to unify digital education. But the real challenge is ensuring that these tools reach every student, especially those with learning differences.

Finally, we need a cultural shift. Learning disabilities are not a source of shame, but different ways of processing information. Public awareness campaigns and films such as Taare Zameen Par can play a crucial role in changing perceptions, but awareness must start at home. Parents play a critical role in recognising early signs and advocating for the support their children’s needs. Educating them about available resources and how to navigate the system is important.

Teachers, too, need motivation. Incentivising specialised training in neurodiversity — through financial rewards, career advancement, or recognition — will encourage more educators to embrace adaptive methods. Government bodies, NGOs, and private institutions must work together to innovate and ensure that these policies become actionable solutions.

The reality of learning disabilities is complex, but our response doesn’t have to be. With understanding, empathy, and evidence-based interventions, we can create an education system that truly leaves no child behind. This is not just about fairness; it is about unlocking the potential of millions of young minds who think differently. As we stand at the cusp of becoming a global superpower, the time to act is now. Our children are counting on us.

The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, is a landmark legislation in India that replaced the Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995. The Act aligns with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, focusing on protecting and promoting the rights of people with disabilities (PwDs) in India. Here’s a draft overview highlighting the main sections of the Act:

### 1. **Expanded Definition of Disability**
   - The Act broadens the definition of disability from 7 categories in the 1995 Act to 21. The new categories include mental illness, autism spectrum disorder, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, chronic neurological conditions, multiple sclerosis, and several others.
   - The Central Government has the authority to add more disabilities if needed.

### 2. **Rights and Entitlements**
   - Every PwD has the right to equality, non-discrimination, respect for their dignity, and access to an inclusive environment.
   - Ensures access to all public services, including educational institutions, health services, and workplaces, by requiring reasonable accommodations.
   - Guarantees the right to live independently, participate fully in society, and access justice on an equal basis.

### 3. **Education and Employment**
   - Mandates inclusive education for children with disabilities, focusing on accessibility and individualized support.
   - Private and public sector establishments with 20 or more employees must comply with accessibility standards, fostering inclusive workplaces.
   - Reservations in government jobs have increased from 3% to 4% for PwDs, covering positions in government educational institutions and government-aided establishments.

### 4. **Skill Development and Employment Support**
   - Promotes vocational training and skill development for PwDs, enabling them to compete equally in the job market.
   - Special provisions include employment programs tailored to different disabilities and incentives for employers who hire PwDs.

### 5. **Social Security, Health, and Rehabilitation**
   - Requires the government to formulate schemes for providing PwDs with social security benefits, financial assistance, healthcare, and accessible rehabilitation services.
   - Includes provisions for free healthcare in government hospitals and priority in attending to PwDs in healthcare facilities.

### 6. **Accessibility Standards**
   - Mandates accessibility in all public buildings, transportation systems, and information and communication technology (ICT).
   - Introduces timelines for the implementation of universal accessibility features across various sectors.

### 7. **Legal Capacity and Guardianship**
   - Recognizes the legal capacity of PwDs, allowing them to make decisions regarding their lives.
   - Includes provisions for limited guardianship, where a PwD can make decisions with the support of a guardian if needed.

### 8. **Penalties for Violations**
   - Non-compliance with provisions of the Act results in penalties and fines, underscoring the need for adherence.
   - Enforces accountability and encourages strict compliance from public institutions and private establishments.

### 9. **Grievance Redressal Mechanism**
   - Establishes State and District-level Disability Advisory Boards for effective implementation and monitoring of the Act.
   - Enables PwDs to seek redressal through special courts for quick disposal of cases.

### Key Highlights of the Act:
   - **Increased Reservations**: Reservations in jobs and educational institutions to foster more opportunities for PwDs.
   - **Accessibility Mandate**: Strict timelines for ensuring accessibility in all public spaces.
   - **Legal Rights Recognition**: Full recognition of the legal rights of PwDs, ensuring equal participation in all aspects of life.

### Summary
The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, provides a comprehensive framework to protect and empower PwDs in India. It emphasizes inclusivity, accessibility, equal opportunity in education and employment, health, and social security, while aiming to create a supportive and barrier-free environment for people with disabilities.

> In Indian classrooms, students with learning disabilities often struggle silently, particularly when pressured or interrupted while expressing ideas. This momentary halt does more than just silence a student; it disrupts their ability to think, process, and articulate thoughts. Such instances reveal that learning disabilities extend beyond reading and writing, affecting cognitive engagement. With an estimated 8-15% (50 million) schoolgoing children in India facing learning disabilities, the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 recognizes these needs. However, most schools lack the necessary resources and training to support them, underscoring the need for more inclusive and understanding educational environments.
