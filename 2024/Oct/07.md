# HC orders autopsy at AIIMS for Bengal child rape victim

### Calcutta High Court Raises Concerns Over Investigation in Rape and Murder of Nine-Year-Old Girl

The **Calcutta High Court** expressed serious concerns on Sunday regarding the investigation into the alleged **rape and murder** of a nine-year-old girl in **Jaynagar**, located in **South 24 Parganas** district of West Bengal. The court noted that the charges under the **Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act** had not yet been included in the investigation. This raised alarm as POCSO is a crucial law designed to protect children from sexual violence, and its exclusion could significantly impact the legal proceedings in the case.

### **The Incident**

The incident occurred in the small town of Jaynagar, where the body of a nine-year-old girl was found under suspicious circumstances. Initial reports indicated that the child had been **sexually assaulted** and subsequently **murdered**, sparking outrage in the local community. Such heinous crimes against children are deeply disturbing, and there is a legal and moral imperative to ensure that justice is delivered swiftly and appropriately.

Following the discovery of the body, local authorities initiated an investigation into the matter. However, the High Court's concerns arose from the fact that even though the crime appeared to involve sexual violence, the **POCSO Act**, which deals specifically with such offenses, had not been applied in the charges filed by the investigating authorities.

### **Importance of the POCSO Act**

The **Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act**, enacted in 2012, is a vital piece of legislation aimed at safeguarding children from sexual abuse, harassment, and pornography. The act covers a broad range of offenses, including sexual assault, harassment, and exploitation of children. It also prescribes strict punishments for offenders and ensures that children’s rights are protected during investigations and trials.

Given that the victim in this case was a child, the inclusion of POCSO charges is crucial for ensuring that the investigation addresses all aspects of the crime, including the sexual violence that the child allegedly suffered. The absence of POCSO in the initial charges has raised questions about the thoroughness of the investigation and whether all necessary legal provisions are being applied.

### **Court’s Intervention and Call for Justice**

The Calcutta High Court's intervention highlights the importance of applying appropriate legal frameworks when dealing with sensitive and serious cases involving children. The court has emphasized that the investigation must be conducted with due diligence, ensuring that all relevant laws, particularly the **POCSO Act**, are applied to provide justice to the victim.

The court expressed its concern over the possibility that the failure to invoke POCSO charges could affect the gravity of the case and potentially lead to a miscarriage of justice. The High Court has directed the authorities to review the case and ensure that POCSO is included in the investigation, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive and child-sensitive approach to handling such cases.

### **Public Outcry and Response**

The incident has sparked widespread public outcry, with people demanding justice for the young victim. Local communities have organized protests and vigils, calling on law enforcement agencies to act swiftly and decisively. Child rights activists and legal experts have also urged the authorities to ensure that all relevant laws, including POCSO, are invoked to ensure a fair and thorough investigation.

The exclusion of POCSO in the initial stages of the investigation has been seen by many as a significant oversight, and there are concerns that this could set a dangerous precedent for future cases involving child victims of sexual violence. The public has called for greater accountability in the investigation process and urged the judiciary to monitor the case closely to ensure justice is served.

### **Conclusion**

The **Calcutta High Court’s concerns** over the omission of POCSO charges in the investigation of the rape and murder of a nine-year-old girl underscore the importance of a **comprehensive legal approach** to cases involving child victims. The **POCSO Act** is a critical tool in the fight against child sexual abuse, and its exclusion from the case could hinder justice for the victim. The court's intervention serves as a reminder that the legal system must be vigilant in applying all necessary laws to protect vulnerable children and ensure that those responsible for such heinous crimes are held accountable. The case is a stark reminder of the ongoing need to strengthen child protection mechanisms and ensure justice for victims of sexual violence.

# A learning curve

### Centre Launches Online Portal for PM Internship Scheme

On **October 3**, without much fanfare, the Indian government launched an online portal to implement the **PM Internship Scheme**, a key initiative announced in the **2024 Union Budget**. The scheme aims to address the critical issue of **unemployment** among India’s youth, particularly those struggling to secure jobs due to a **mismatch of skills** and market requirements. The portal is expected to serve as a platform for connecting India’s unemployed or underemployed youth with top companies for internships, helping them gain industry-relevant experience and skills.

### **PM Internship Scheme: Bridging the Skills Gap**

One of the primary objectives of the **PM Internship Scheme** is to address the gap between the skill sets of unemployed youth and the needs of the modern job market. While India has a large young population, many are considered **unemployable** because their formal education and training do not align with the demands of industries. This has led to high unemployment rates, despite the availability of jobs in sectors like IT, manufacturing, and services.

The scheme aims to equip youth with the skills required by top employers, allowing them to gain **hands-on experience** in real-world work environments. Internships have become an essential step in the career-building process, enabling young people to improve their employability, enhance their skill set, and build networks that could lead to future employment opportunities.

### **Functionality of the Portal**

The newly launched portal is designed to streamline the entire process of matching interns with companies. It allows **India’s top 500 companies** to post internship opportunities, including details such as job roles, required skills, and duration. **Unemployed youth** can register on the platform, upload their resumes, and apply for internships in relevant fields.

The portal also serves as a **monitoring tool** for tracking the progress of the internships. Both employers and interns can provide feedback, allowing for continuous improvement in the matching and training processes. Moreover, it ensures transparency and accountability by maintaining clear records of internship offers, acceptances, and outcomes.

### **Scope and Scale**

The scheme is expected to provide internships to **about one lakh youth** by the end of the year. The government has made it clear that this initiative is not just about creating temporary employment opportunities but about creating a **skilled workforce** that meets the demands of the market. The internships are likely to cover a wide range of sectors, including **technology, finance, healthcare, manufacturing, and services**.

Many leading companies, such as **Mahindra and Mahindra**, **Max Life Insurance**, and **Alembic Pharma**, have already signed up for the scheme, offering more than 1,000 internships within hours of the portal’s launch. As more companies join, the number of opportunities is expected to increase, with a projected target of 100,000 internships by the end of 2024.

### **Addressing Youth Unemployment and Enhancing Employability**

India’s **youth unemployment rate** has been a growing concern, with a large proportion of the country’s young population either unemployed or underemployed. This has created a significant need for programs that not only create job opportunities but also equip youth with the skills and experience necessary for sustained employment.

The PM Internship Scheme directly tackles this issue by offering practical, industry-specific experience. Internships allow young people to develop the **soft skills** and **technical knowledge** necessary to secure full-time employment in their chosen fields. Additionally, this initiative creates a **networking platform**, helping interns connect with potential employers, mentors, and industry leaders.

The scheme is particularly beneficial for those who may have completed formal education but have not been able to secure jobs due to a lack of practical experience. By providing them with internships, the government hopes to reduce unemployment and underemployment, ultimately boosting the country’s overall **economic productivity**.

### **Conclusion**

The launch of the online portal for the **PM Internship Scheme** marks a significant step toward addressing **youth unemployment** and **skill gaps** in India. By creating a centralized platform for internships and promoting collaboration between the government, educational institutions, and private companies, the scheme aims to empower India’s youth with the necessary skills to succeed in the job market. This initiative, if executed effectively, has the potential to make a substantial impact on the country’s employment landscape by transforming the future prospects of thousands of young Indians.

> On **October 3**, the Indian government launched an online portal for the **PM Internship Scheme**, aimed at addressing youth unemployment by bridging the gap between their skills and market demands. The portal connects unemployed or underemployed youth with India’s top 500 companies for internships, providing hands-on industry experience. The scheme, announced in the 2024 Union Budget, targets equipping around **one lakh youth** with skills in sectors such as technology, finance, and healthcare. The portal ensures transparency, progress tracking, and accountability, ultimately aiming to create a more **skilled workforce** and reduce youth unemployment in the country.

# Excavations begin at megalithic burial site in Chamarajanagar

### University of Mysore Scholars Begin Excavation of Megalithic Burial Sites in Chamarajanagar District

A team of history and archaeology scholars and students from the **University of Mysore** has embarked on an important archaeological excavation of **megalithic burial sites** in the **Chamarajanagar district** of Karnataka. The excavation is taking place at **Doddalathur village**, situated in a small valley formed by the **Male Mahadeshwara Hill** ranges in the **Hanur taluk** of the district. This effort is being conducted in collaboration with the **Mythic Society** of Bengaluru, a prominent organization dedicated to research in history and archaeology.

### **Significance of the Excavation**

The excavation aims to uncover valuable insights into the **megalithic culture**, which thrived in parts of southern India during the **Iron Age** (approximately 1000 BCE to 500 CE). **Megalithic sites** are characterized by large stone structures that were often used for burials or as commemorative monuments. These structures can include **dolmens**, **cairns**, and **stone circles**, which were part of the burial practices of ancient communities. The discovery and study of these burial sites are crucial for understanding the social, cultural, and technological aspects of early human societies in the region.

The Doddalathur village, where the current excavation is taking place, is believed to be part of a larger network of **megalithic burial sites** scattered across the **Deccan Plateau**. These burial sites typically contain not only skeletal remains but also a variety of **grave goods** such as pottery, iron tools, weapons, and occasionally ornaments made from materials like gold or semi-precious stones. Such artifacts help researchers piece together the lifestyle, trade, and belief systems of the communities that lived during the megalithic period.

### **Objectives of the Excavation**

The primary objective of this excavation is to explore and document the **megalithic burial practices** of the region. Researchers aim to study the **layout and construction** of these burial sites to understand more about the **funerary customs** and the **social hierarchy** of the ancient people. The size, complexity, and contents of these burials often reflect the status and importance of the individuals interred.

Additionally, the project aims to unearth artifacts and remains that can be analyzed for **radio-carbon dating** and other forms of **scientific analysis**, which will provide more accurate timelines of the settlement and its people. These findings can potentially rewrite parts of the regional history, giving more clarity on the interaction between the megalithic culture in southern India and other contemporary cultures in India and beyond.

### **Collaboration with Mythic Society**

The **Mythic Society**, which has a long-standing reputation in historical and archaeological research, is partnering with the University of Mysore to conduct this excavation. The collaboration brings together academic expertise and resources, enhancing the scope and precision of the excavation. Together, the teams will catalog and preserve any findings from the site to contribute to the wider body of knowledge regarding megalithic societies.

### **Preservation and Future Research**

The findings from this excavation will not only help scholars gain a deeper understanding of megalithic societies but also contribute to the **preservation** of India's rich archaeological heritage. Once the excavation is complete, the site and its findings will be documented and potentially exhibited to educate the public about the importance of megalithic culture in Indian history.

The University of Mysore team also hopes that this excavation will pave the way for **future research** in the area. Megalithic sites in Karnataka are relatively underexplored compared to other regions in India, and the successful excavation of Doddalathur could encourage more archaeologists to explore similar sites throughout the state.

### **Conclusion**

The ongoing excavation at **Doddalathur village** represents an exciting opportunity to uncover the secrets of **megalithic burial practices** in southern India. Led by scholars and students from the **University of Mysore** and supported by the **Mythic Society**, the excavation could yield crucial information about the cultural and social lives of the megalithic people. This project not only contributes to academic research but also plays an essential role in preserving India's rich archaeological heritage.

# A three-tier war in West Asia with no endgame

### The Three-Tier War in West Asia: A Complex and Escalating Conflict

In his October 2023 essay in **Foreign Affairs**, **U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan** highlighted what he perceived to be a relatively quiet period in the **Middle East** (or **West Asia**), despite ongoing tensions. He acknowledged that while the **Israeli-Palestinian conflict** remained tense, especially in the **West Bank**, the U.S. had de-escalated crises in Gaza. However, this assessment was swiftly upended on **October 7, 2023**, when **Hamas** launched its deadliest attack on **Israel**, killing at least 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostages. This incident marked the beginning of yet another deadly chapter in the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict.

### **Hamas Attack: A Game Changer**

The **Hamas** attack on **October 7** was a significant turning point. It shattered the relatively quiet period in the region, initiating a brutal conflict between **Israel** and Hamas, with wide-ranging consequences. This escalation led to one of the bloodiest spells in the Israel-Palestine conflict in decades. Israel's retaliatory strikes on **Gaza** have resulted in thousands of deaths and have further inflamed regional tensions.

Hamas, a **Palestinian Islamist group**, has long been at the center of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It governs the **Gaza Strip** and has repeatedly engaged in armed confrontations with Israel. Its attack in October 2023 was its most severe in years, escalating hostilities to a new level. In response, Israel launched a heavy military campaign against Gaza, leading to widespread devastation and suffering on both sides.

### **A Three-Tier War: The Broader Conflict**

The conflict in West Asia today is far more complex than just the **Israel-Palestine issue**. It is, in essence, a **three-tier war** involving:

1. **Israel and Hamas**: The direct military conflict between **Israel** and **Hamas** remains the focal point, with both sides engaged in intense fighting. The violence has drawn global attention, and calls for a ceasefire have been largely ignored as the conflict continues to escalate.

2. **Israel and Iran**: Behind Hamas stands **Iran**, a major regional power and supporter of the Palestinian cause. Iran has long provided financial and military support to **Hamas** and **Hezbollah** (a Lebanese militant group), further complicating the regional dynamics. The **Iran-Israel conflict** is a shadow war, with Iran supporting anti-Israel factions while Israel targets Iranian assets and allies in the region, including in **Syria** and **Lebanon**.

3. **Proxy Conflicts Involving Regional Powers**: The conflict in West Asia is also influenced by broader **regional rivalries**. Countries like **Saudi Arabia**, **Turkey**, and **Egypt** play pivotal roles in the region’s political landscape, often aligning with or against factions based on their geopolitical interests. Saudi Arabia and Iran, for example, are engaged in a broader power struggle, with Iran backing groups like **Hamas** and Hezbollah, and Saudi Arabia pursuing its own interests in Yemen and elsewhere.

### **No Clear Endgame**

What makes this three-tier war particularly dangerous is the absence of a clear **endgame**. The Israel-Palestine conflict has been ongoing for decades, and every fresh outbreak of violence further diminishes the prospects for a peaceful resolution. Hamas’s actions, coupled with Iran’s backing, complicate any diplomatic efforts. Meanwhile, Israel’s hardline military approach, aimed at eradicating Hamas, risks further destabilizing the region.

The broader **geopolitical implications** of the conflict also play into the uncertainty. As Israel and Iran continue their indirect confrontations, and as other regional powers assert their influence, the conflict could spiral into a larger war with consequences far beyond the immediate region.

### **Conclusion**

The October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel reignited long-standing tensions in **West Asia** and escalated the conflict into a **three-tier war** involving Israel, Hamas, Iran, and various regional actors. The situation today is deadlier and more complex than it has been in decades, with no clear resolution in sight. The intertwined local, regional, and international dimensions of the conflict make it a highly volatile and dangerous situation, with global implications.

> The October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel, which killed over 1,200 people and took 250 hostages, reignited severe violence in the **Israel-Palestine conflict**, marking one of its deadliest phases in decades. This escalation is part of a broader **three-tier war** in **West Asia**, involving Israel's conflict with Hamas, Iran's support for Hamas and Hezbollah, and regional rivalries involving powers like **Saudi Arabia** and **Turkey**. The conflict has no clear endgame, as Israel's military response, coupled with Iran's backing of anti-Israel factions, threatens to further destabilize the region, complicating diplomatic efforts and intensifying the geopolitical landscape.

# Muizzu to meet Modi, request India’s support over looming economic crisis

### Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu Begins Four-Day State Visit to India

**Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu** arrived in **New Delhi** on Sunday for a crucial four-day state visit to India, amid an escalating economic crisis and imminent debt repayment challenges facing his country. This visit marks his first official trip to India since taking office, and it comes at a time when the Maldives is grappling with substantial economic pressures, including a significant debt burden, particularly to China. President Muizzu’s meetings with Indian leaders, including **Prime Minister Narendra Modi**, are expected to focus on strengthening bilateral ties and seeking support for the Maldives' economic challenges.

### **Economic Crisis in the Maldives**

The Maldives, a small island nation in the Indian Ocean, has been facing **economic difficulties**, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and an overreliance on tourism. Tourism, which constitutes nearly 28% of the country's GDP and 60% of its foreign exchange earnings, was severely impacted during the pandemic, resulting in a massive loss of revenue. While tourism has been gradually recovering, the country's economy remains fragile.

A key issue is the **national debt**, which has increased significantly over the past decade. Much of this debt is attributed to **infrastructure projects** funded by loans, particularly from China, under its **Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)**. The Maldives owes a substantial portion of its debt to Chinese creditors, which has raised concerns about the country’s ability to meet its repayment obligations. As the deadline for some of these repayments approaches, President Muizzu faces growing pressure to find solutions to manage the debt crisis and avoid further financial instability.

### **India-Maldives Relations**

India and the Maldives have historically shared close ties, with India playing a pivotal role in the Maldives’ economic development, security, and disaster relief efforts. Over the years, India has provided the Maldives with **financial aid**, **investment**, and **infrastructure support**, and has been one of the first responders during natural disasters. India’s **“Neighborhood First” policy** has prioritized strengthening relations with countries in its immediate vicinity, including the Maldives.

During the presidency of **Ibrahim Mohamed Solih**, the Maldives pursued a **“India-first” policy**, which emphasized closer cooperation with India, particularly in areas of security, economic development, and counter-terrorism. India’s support was crucial in helping the Maldives manage the challenges posed by the pandemic, with India providing medical supplies, vaccines, and financial aid.

However, President Muizzu, who is seen as favoring closer ties with **China**, campaigned on a platform of balancing the Maldives’ relationships with both India and China. His visit to India is being closely watched, as it will provide insight into how he plans to navigate this delicate diplomatic balance.

### **Key Agendas for the Visit**

1. **Debt Relief and Economic Cooperation**: With the Maldives facing imminent debt repayments, it is expected that President Muizzu will seek **economic assistance** or restructuring agreements from India. India has previously extended financial support to the Maldives, including lines of credit for infrastructure development and budgetary aid. Discussions may focus on further support to ease the Maldives’ debt burden.

2. **Strengthening Economic Ties**: The two countries are expected to discuss ways to boost **trade and investment**, with a particular focus on tourism, infrastructure, and renewable energy. India has been a key partner in building infrastructure projects in the Maldives, including ports, airports, and housing projects. Strengthening economic cooperation could help the Maldives diversify its economy and reduce its dependence on tourism.

3. **Regional Security and Defense Cooperation**: As an important partner in ensuring **maritime security** in the Indian Ocean region, the Maldives plays a key role in maintaining regional stability. Both India and the Maldives are likely to discuss enhancing **defense cooperation**, with India providing continued support in areas like coast guard training, maritime surveillance, and counter-terrorism efforts. With growing Chinese influence in the region, India is keen to maintain its strategic ties with the Maldives to ensure regional security.

4. **Climate Change and Sustainable Development**: As a **low-lying island nation**, the Maldives is highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, including rising sea levels and extreme weather events. Both India and the Maldives are expected to discuss **climate change mitigation** strategies and collaborate on **sustainable development projects**, such as renewable energy initiatives and disaster preparedness.

### **Conclusion**

President **Mohamed Muizzu’s visit to India** comes at a critical juncture for the Maldives, as the country faces mounting economic challenges, particularly its debt burden. The meetings with Indian leaders, including **Prime Minister Narendra Modi**, are expected to focus on finding solutions to the Maldives’ financial woes, while also strengthening bilateral ties in areas such as trade, defense, and climate action. For India, maintaining a strong relationship with the Maldives is strategically important in the context of regional security and the growing influence of China in the Indian Ocean. This visit could define the future trajectory of **India-Maldives relations** under President Muizzu’s leadership.

> Maldives President **Mohamed Muizzu** arrived in **New Delhi** for a four-day state visit, focusing on addressing his country's **economic crisis** and imminent **debt repayment**, especially to China. In meetings with Indian leaders, including **Prime Minister Narendra Modi**, discussions are expected to cover **economic assistance**, debt relief, and boosting **bilateral ties** in areas like **trade, infrastructure, and defense**. India and the Maldives share historically close relations, with India providing crucial economic and security support. As Muizzu navigates balancing relations with India and China, this visit will shape the future trajectory of **India-Maldives relations** under his leadership.

# Judiciary, legislature have no executive authority, says V-P

### Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar on Separation of Powers in Democracy

On Sunday, **Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar** emphasized the importance of the **separation of powers** in India’s democracy, highlighting that the exercise of **executive authority** by either the judiciary or the legislature is not aligned with democratic or **constitutional prescriptions**. His remarks underscore the need for all branches of government—the **executive**, **legislature**, and **judiciary**—to function within their constitutionally defined boundaries to maintain a balanced and functional democracy.

### **Separation of Powers and Its Importance**

The concept of **separation of powers** is central to the **Indian Constitution**, where the three branches of government are expected to operate independently to avoid any one branch from overstepping its role. The **executive** (government), **legislature** (parliament), and **judiciary** (courts) have distinct functions. The executive implements laws, the legislature makes laws, and the judiciary interprets laws. This balance prevents the concentration of power and protects democratic governance.

Vice-President Dhankhar’s statement reflects a concern that any encroachment by one branch on the authority of another could disrupt this balance. If the judiciary or legislature assumes executive functions, it could undermine the proper functioning of democracy. His remarks seem to call for each branch to respect the autonomy of the others, ensuring that they adhere to their prescribed constitutional roles.

### **Judiciary and Executive Overreach**

The Vice-President’s comments are significant in the context of ongoing debates about **judicial overreach** and **legislative authority** in India. Judicial overreach refers to instances where the judiciary, through **activism or rulings**, appears to assume the role of the executive by directing government actions or policies. While judicial intervention is necessary to uphold **constitutional rights** and protect citizens, excessive interference can be viewed as undermining the executive's ability to function independently.

Similarly, if the legislature or the executive tries to exert influence over judicial decisions, it risks infringing on the judiciary’s role as the **guardian of the Constitution**.

### **A Call for Constitutional Adherence**

Vice-President Dhankhar’s remarks suggest a call for strict **adherence to the Constitution** and its principles of governance. He emphasized that any action or exercise of authority outside of constitutional boundaries poses a threat to the **democratic framework**. The statement reaffirms the need for dialogue and respect among the three branches of government to ensure that democracy in India functions as intended.

### **Conclusion**

Vice-President Dhankhar’s comments highlight the importance of maintaining a balance of power among the executive, legislature, and judiciary, in line with democratic values and constitutional principles. His call for adherence to the separation of powers reflects the ongoing necessity for each branch to function within its defined role to preserve democratic governance in India.

> Vice-President **Jagdeep Dhankhar** emphasized the importance of the **separation of powers** in India's democracy, stating that the **judiciary** or **legislature** exercising **executive authority** goes against democratic and constitutional principles. He stressed that each branch of government—the **executive**, **legislature**, and **judiciary**—should operate within its constitutionally defined limits to maintain balance and prevent overreach. Dhankhar's remarks highlight concerns about **judicial overreach** and the potential for disruption if any branch encroaches on another's role, calling for strict adherence to the **Constitution** to ensure that India's democratic system functions properly.

# The status of the civil war in Sudan

### Renewed Violence in Sudan: SAF Launches Offensive Against RSF

On **September 26**, the **Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF)** launched a major offensive against the paramilitary **Rapid Support Forces (RSF)** in **Khartoum** and **Bahri**, reigniting the ongoing civil war in Sudan, which had been relatively quiet for several months. The latest wave of violence has further destabilized the region, just as efforts were underway for ceasefire talks led by the **United States** on the sidelines of the **UN General Assembly**. After 18 months of conflict, peace remains elusive, and the human toll continues to rise.

### **Background of the Conflict**

The civil war in Sudan erupted in **April 2022** following a power struggle between the **Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF)**, led by **General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan**, and the **Rapid Support Forces (RSF)**, led by **General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo**, also known as **Hemedti**. The two factions, once allied during the overthrow of former President **Omar al-Bashir**, have since turned on each other in a violent contest for control over the country.

Initially, both the SAF and RSF were part of Sudan's transitional government, formed after Bashir’s ousting in 2019. However, disagreements over the integration of the RSF into the SAF, as well as broader issues of political power and military control, led to the collapse of peace efforts. Since the outbreak of fighting, both sides have engaged in intense urban warfare, especially in the capital, **Khartoum**, causing widespread destruction and massive civilian casualties.

### **Current Offensive and Casualties**

The **September 26 offensive** by the SAF has significantly intensified the conflict. The fighting has centered around **Khartoum** and its neighboring city **Bahri** (also known as **North Khartoum**), both critical urban centers. The RSF, known for its guerrilla-style tactics, has been entrenched in various parts of the cities, leading to street-by-street fighting.

In the 18 months of conflict, the **United Nations (UN)** estimates that more than **20,000 people** have been killed, while millions have been displaced. The **International Organization for Migration (IOM)** reported that as of **October 1**, there were approximately **10.9 million internally displaced persons (IDPs)** in Sudan, marking one of the largest displacement crises in the world. Additionally, millions of Sudanese have fled to neighboring countries, including **Chad**, **South Sudan**, and **Egypt**, creating a significant refugee crisis.

### **Humanitarian Crisis**

Sudan's civil war has led to one of the most severe **humanitarian crises** in the world today. Access to food, clean water, and medical care has been severely limited due to the conflict. Humanitarian organizations have struggled to operate amid the violence, and both the SAF and RSF have been accused of committing **war crimes** and targeting civilians. Infrastructure in major cities like **Khartoum**, including hospitals, schools, and utilities, has been damaged or destroyed, exacerbating the suffering of ordinary people.

The **World Food Programme (WFP)** estimates that nearly **19 million Sudanese**—about 40% of the population—are facing **acute food insecurity** due to the war, with the situation worsening as the conflict drags on. There have also been widespread reports of **sexual violence**, **looting**, and **forced recruitment** by both sides.

### **Failed Ceasefire Efforts**

Despite several attempts by international actors, including the **African Union (AU)**, **United Nations**, and the **United States**, ceasefire agreements and peace talks have consistently failed. Both the SAF and RSF have violated ceasefire agreements within hours of implementation, undermining the possibility of a lasting peace.

The **U.S.-led ceasefire talks** planned for the sidelines of the **UN General Assembly** are seen as another attempt to negotiate a peace deal, but optimism is low given the failure of previous efforts. The deep-rooted distrust between the two factions, compounded by the involvement of external actors, including **Egypt**, **Saudi Arabia**, and the **United Arab Emirates**, complicates the situation further.

### **International Implications**

Sudan’s conflict has far-reaching implications for the region and beyond. The instability threatens to spill over into neighboring countries, particularly **South Sudan** and **Chad**, which are already struggling with internal issues. Additionally, the mass displacement of people from Sudan has created a significant refugee crisis, putting pressure on already fragile economies in surrounding countries.

Global powers, including the **United States**, the **European Union**, and **Russia**, have strategic interests in Sudan, particularly regarding its **Red Sea coast** and its **gold resources**, making the conflict a focal point for international diplomacy.

### **Conclusion**

The **Sudanese civil war** continues to spiral out of control, with no clear end in sight. The recent **SAF offensive** has only escalated the violence, while millions of civilians remain trapped in a worsening humanitarian crisis. Despite international efforts to broker peace, the deep-rooted tensions between the SAF and RSF, along with regional and global interests, make it difficult to find a resolution. As Sudan descends further into chaos, the need for a comprehensive peace plan and sustained international pressure on the warring factions has never been more urgent.

# Five languages got classical tag after key provision dropped

### Union Cabinet Grants Classical Language Status to Five More Languages

The **Union Cabinet** has made a significant decision to accord **classical language status** to five more languages, including **Marathi** and **Bengali**. This decision comes after a crucial modification in the criteria for granting classical status, particularly the removal of the requirement that a language must have an **original literary tradition**. The move reflects a more inclusive approach to recognizing the rich linguistic heritage of Indian languages and acknowledges their historical and cultural importance.

### **The Revised Criteria for Classical Language Status**

The previous criterion mandated that a language seeking classical status must have an **original literary tradition**, meaning it had to produce unique literary works that were not heavily influenced by or borrowed from other languages. However, this criterion proved to be a challenge, particularly for languages that developed alongside others, as ancient languages often borrowed from each other, influencing and enriching one another’s traditions.

A **senior member** of the **Linguistic Expert Committee**, which advises the government on such matters, explained the difficulty in proving or disproving the originality of literary traditions. "All ancient languages borrowed from each other but recreated the texts in their own way," he said, adding that the committee realized it was unreasonable to expect proof of purely original works, especially when languages have coexisted and evolved together for centuries.

As a result, the committee recommended shifting the focus from literary originality to more **tangible evidence**, such as **archaeological**, **historical**, and **numismatic** (related to coins and currency) records. These forms of evidence provide a clearer, more concrete understanding of a language's historical significance and its role in the cultural and social fabric of a civilization.

### **Significance of the Decision**

The decision to relax the criteria opens the door for more languages to be recognized as classical. The **classical language status** is not just a symbolic honor; it also comes with tangible benefits. It enables the language to receive increased **financial support** from the government for **research**, **preservation**, and **promotion**. Institutions dedicated to the study of these languages can receive grants for research projects, scholarships, and initiatives aimed at reviving and promoting the language’s rich heritage.

For languages like **Marathi** and **Bengali**, which have extensive literary traditions, this recognition serves as a validation of their historical importance. Marathi, spoken predominantly in the state of Maharashtra, has a rich cultural and literary history, with roots going back over a millennium. Similarly, Bengali, spoken primarily in West Bengal and Bangladesh, has a vibrant literary tradition, contributing significantly to the arts, philosophy, and politics.

### **Archaeological, Historical, and Numismatic Evidence**

The focus on **archaeological**, **historical**, and **numismatic evidence** offers a new approach to recognizing a language's classical status. Archaeological findings, such as ancient manuscripts, inscriptions, and monuments, provide insight into the use and evolution of a language over centuries. **Historical documents**, including royal edicts, official records, and ancient texts, shed light on how the language was used in governance, culture, and trade.

**Numismatic evidence**—the study of coins—plays a significant role in understanding the spread and influence of a language. Coins often bear inscriptions in local languages and reflect the political and economic power of a kingdom. The use of specific languages in ancient coins highlights their importance in administration and daily life.

### **Impact on Other Languages**

The removal of the requirement for an original literary tradition could pave the way for other languages with rich cultural histories to be recognized as classical languages. Many Indian languages that have evolved over centuries, borrowing and lending from each other, can now present their historical evidence to seek classical status. This shift could lead to a broader acknowledgment of India’s vast and diverse linguistic heritage.

### **Conclusion**

The Union Cabinet’s decision to grant **classical language status** to **Marathi**, **Bengali**, and three other languages marks a pivotal moment in recognizing the historical and cultural significance of Indian languages. By removing the criterion of original literary tradition, the government has taken a more inclusive approach, acknowledging the complex and interconnected evolution of languages. The focus on archaeological, historical, and numismatic evidence provides a more tangible basis for granting classical status, ensuring that India’s rich linguistic heritage is properly honored and preserved. This decision not only celebrates the contributions of these languages but also paves the way for further research, preservation, and promotion of India’s diverse linguistic traditions.
