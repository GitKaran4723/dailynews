# Why India is at risk of becoming a ‘diminishing democracy’

India, the world’s largest democracy, has long held a position of respect in global democratic rankings due to its diverse electoral system, vibrant civil society, and historical commitment to democratic principles. However, in recent years, concerns have been raised that India may be at risk of becoming a ‘diminishing democracy,’ where democratic norms weaken, institutions face erosion, and individual freedoms are compromised. These concerns center on issues such as press freedom, judicial independence, political centralization, minority rights, and civil liberties. Here’s an exploration of the factors that could contribute to this erosion of democratic standards in India.

### 1. **Concentration of Power and Centralization**

   - In recent years, there has been an increasing centralization of power within the executive branch of the Indian government. This consolidation, led largely by the Prime Minister’s Office, can undermine the autonomy of other branches, such as the judiciary and the legislature. Centralized power, while expedient, runs the risk of undermining democratic principles, as decisions become increasingly unilateral, sidelining the voices of elected representatives.
   - Additionally, state governments often face encroachment from the central government, with resources and autonomy at times withheld for political reasons. This centralization weakens federalism, a core principle in India’s democratic setup, where states should have a degree of independence in managing regional matters.

### 2. **Judicial Independence and Autonomy**

   - The judiciary in India has historically been a strong guardian of constitutional rights and democracy. However, recent trends indicate potential challenges to its independence, with allegations of pressure on the judiciary to align with the government’s interests. Instances of selective appointments and delays in filling judicial vacancies contribute to these concerns.
   - Additionally, public faith in the judiciary can diminish when perceived as favoring the executive, raising concerns about checks and balances. A judiciary compromised in its independence is less able to uphold individual freedoms, prevent governmental overreach, and maintain constitutional integrity.

### 3. **Erosion of Press Freedom**

   - Press freedom is essential in a democracy, providing transparency, holding power to account, and informing the public. However, India’s press freedom ranking has declined in recent years, as journalists face increasing challenges, from legal intimidation to physical threats and even arrests.
   - Certain media outlets appear constrained in their ability to criticize the government, with fears of retaliation or shutdowns looming large. Government influence over major media corporations and pressure on independent journalism undermine the democratic role of the press, reducing citizens’ access to unbiased information and diverse perspectives.

### 4. **Civil Liberties and Freedom of Expression**

   - A democracy thrives on freedom of expression, allowing citizens to voice dissent, criticism, and differing opinions. However, India has seen increasing restrictions on freedom of expression, with dissenters, activists, and intellectuals facing harassment or arrests under laws such as the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) and sedition charges.
   - The growing use of such laws against those perceived to criticize the government raises concerns about silencing opposition voices. Civil liberties are further threatened by surveillance on social media and restrictions on internet access in certain areas, particularly in regions experiencing unrest, such as Jammu and Kashmir.

### 5. **Challenges to Minority Rights**

   - Protecting minority rights is a cornerstone of a healthy democracy. However, India has witnessed a rise in polarization along religious and ethnic lines, leading to increased instances of communal violence and marginalization of certain communities.
   - Policy changes, such as the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), are viewed by some as discriminatory, creating fear and insecurity within minority populations. The perception of bias and exclusion fuels social divisions, weakening the democratic ideal of equal treatment for all citizens.

### 6. **Weakening of Democratic Institutions and Civil Society**

   - Civil society organizations (CSOs) are fundamental to democracy, promoting social change, human rights, and accountability. However, in recent years, CSOs in India have faced restrictions through regulations such as the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA), which limits their funding and activities.
   - Excessive restrictions hamper civil society’s ability to function independently and advocate for democratic principles. A robust democracy requires an active civil society capable of challenging and critiquing government policies, which becomes difficult when CSOs face legal and financial constraints.

### 7. **Electoral Integrity and Polarization**

   - India’s electoral process is a critical aspect of its democratic structure, yet issues such as electoral funding, biased media coverage, and voter polarization raise concerns. The lack of transparency in political funding through mechanisms like electoral bonds potentially allows anonymous, unchecked influence on political campaigns.
   - Additionally, voter polarization on religious and cultural lines has intensified, affecting the quality of democratic participation and shifting focus from policy issues to identity-based conflicts. This polarization risks creating a divided electorate, impacting social cohesion and diminishing democratic discourse.

### Conclusion

India’s risk of becoming a ‘diminishing democracy’ arises from multifaceted challenges that strain its democratic fabric. Concentration of power, diminished judicial and press freedoms, constraints on civil liberties, and the erosion of minority rights undermine core democratic principles. Safeguarding India’s democratic ideals requires a renewed commitment to upholding checks and balances, protecting institutional independence, ensuring accountability, and fostering a culture of inclusivity and respect for civil liberties. Only through sustained vigilance and reform can India preserve its standing as a robust, pluralistic democracy.

> India faces risks of becoming a 'diminishing democracy' due to factors such as power centralization, judicial pressure, restricted press freedom, and reduced civil liberties. Concentration of executive power challenges federalism, while concerns over judicial independence weaken checks and balances. Press freedom has declined, with increasing threats to journalists and media independence. Civil liberties face restrictions through laws limiting dissent and surveillance, while polarization threatens minority rights and social cohesion. Civil society and electoral integrity are also under strain, with funding constraints and rising polarization. Safeguarding India’s democracy requires renewed efforts to protect institutional autonomy, civil liberties, and inclusive governance.

# Politics of Inclusion: Caste, Minority, and Representation in India, Zoya Hasan

Certainly! In *Politics of Inclusion: Caste, Minority, and Representation in India*, Zoya Hasan delves deeply into the question of how India’s democratic framework has addressed the issues of social exclusion and inequality, focusing on caste-based and religious minorities. Her work examines how policies of inclusion, such as affirmative action and reservations, have aimed to create pathways for these marginalized groups to participate fully in economic, social, and political life. However, Hasan argues that while these measures have been essential, they are often limited by broader structural and societal challenges.

### Key Themes and Concepts

1. **Historical Exclusion and Structural Inequalities**  
   Hasan begins by tracing how historical and institutional exclusion has shaped the lives of marginalized communities in India. Caste discrimination, deeply embedded in social structures, led to long-term denial of rights and opportunities for Scheduled Castes (Dalits) and Scheduled Tribes, which necessitated policies like reservations in government jobs and education. Similarly, religious minorities, especially Muslims, have faced systemic exclusion, limiting their access to socioeconomic mobility and political representation.

2. **Affirmative Action and Reservations**  
   Hasan discusses the role of reservations in promoting social inclusion, arguing that these policies have been vital in improving access to education, employment, and political opportunities for marginalized groups. She provides an analysis of how affirmative action policies have evolved, assessing their successes and limitations. While quotas in educational institutions and government jobs have brought some change, Hasan points out that such measures alone cannot address the depth of socio-economic exclusion. She argues for an expansion of these policies to encompass economic and social empowerment rather than relying solely on reservations.

3. **Political Representation and the Struggle for Inclusion**  
   Political representation is another core focus in Hasan’s analysis. She examines the electoral system, legislative quotas, and the participation of marginalized groups in politics. While Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes have reservations in parliamentary seats, this inclusion has been limited in impact, as structural inequalities continue to inhibit genuine empowerment. Religious minorities, notably Muslims, lack similar provisions, and their representation in politics has been steadily declining, which Hasan sees as a troubling sign for India’s democracy. She argues that political inclusion cannot be meaningful unless it allows these groups to shape policies that directly affect their lives.

4. **Intersection of Caste, Religion, and Gender**  
   Hasan also explores how caste, religious, and gender identities intersect to create multiple layers of discrimination and exclusion. For instance, Dalit women often face compounded disadvantages as a result of both caste and gender discrimination, which policies frequently fail to address adequately. The book argues that policies need to consider these intersections, advocating for a more nuanced approach that recognizes the complex realities of marginalized groups.

5. **Challenges to Effective Inclusion**  
   Hasan highlights several challenges that undermine effective inclusion. One key issue is political resistance: affirmative action policies and minority rights often face opposition from dominant social groups, creating political divides and slowing down the implementation of inclusive policies. Additionally, social biases and institutional discrimination in workplaces, schools, and communities often persist, even in the presence of legal safeguards.

6. **Beyond Quotas: Toward Social Transformation**  
   Hasan argues that true inclusion requires going beyond quotas and reservations. She calls for policies that empower marginalized communities economically and socially, promoting grassroots change. Hasan emphasizes the need for reforms that foster social transformation, such as improving quality education, access to healthcare, skill development, and creating environments that allow marginalized groups to participate fully in society. 

### Hasan’s Argument for a Broader Approach

Ultimately, Hasan contends that while India's democratic system has made strides toward inclusivity, structural inequalities persist due to deeply ingrained social hierarchies and political resistance. She calls for a broader approach to inclusion, one that doesn’t solely rely on reservations but also focuses on dismantling the social and economic barriers that prevent genuine equality.

### Why Hasan’s Analysis Matters Today

Hasan’s work is particularly relevant in contemporary India, where issues of caste, minority rights, and representation remain central to social justice and equality. Her analysis provides a framework for understanding why, despite progressive policies, exclusion and inequality remain significant challenges. Hasan’s call for policies that address the root causes of exclusion offers a roadmap for making India’s democracy more inclusive and equitable.

### Conclusion

In *Politics of Inclusion*, Hasan provides a nuanced examination of India's efforts to achieve social inclusion for marginalized groups, revealing the limitations and challenges of current policies. Her work advocates for a holistic approach to inclusivity—one that recognizes the complex intersections of caste, religion, and gender and that addresses the underlying societal and structural inequalities. Through this perspective, Hasan’s analysis highlights the need for ongoing reforms and sustained social transformation to achieve true inclusivity in India’s democracy.

She assesses policies like reservations and affirmative action, highlighting their successes and limitations in promoting social and political inclusion. Hasan argues that while these measures help, they do not fully address structural inequalities and the deeper social exclusion that persist. True inclusion, she suggests, requires policies beyond quotas, focusing on economic empowerment, quality education, and dismantling systemic barriers. Hasan emphasizes that achieving genuine democracy in India necessitates broader, transformative reforms.

# Exit polls

Exit polls are surveys conducted immediately after voters leave polling stations, aiming to predict election outcomes before official results are announced. In democracies worldwide, exit polls play a significant role in understanding voter behavior, gauging public sentiment, and offering early insights into electoral outcomes. Media organizations, research agencies, and political analysts closely analyze exit poll data to forecast trends and outcomes, often shaping public discourse even before the final votes are counted.

### How Exit Polls Work

Exit polls are usually conducted by research agencies and polling organizations that deploy survey teams across various polling locations. These teams ask voters whom they voted for or about issues that influenced their decision. To ensure representativeness, polling stations are selected based on geographical diversity, urban-rural composition, and the demographic profile of the electorate. Pollsters use sampling techniques to gather data, which is then weighted and adjusted to reflect the broader voting population accurately.

### Importance of Exit Polls

Exit polls serve several important functions:
1. **Early Indicators**: Exit polls provide early predictions of election outcomes. This can help media, analysts, and political parties get a sense of potential results before the final count, providing a preliminary understanding of the electorate’s mood.
2. **Understanding Voter Behavior**: Exit polls reveal how various demographics, such as age, gender, income, and education, voted. This helps analysts and political parties understand voting patterns and the preferences of different voter groups.
3. **Influencing Public Discourse**: The results of exit polls often influence public opinion and media narratives, impacting how people perceive the electoral process and the issues that drove the vote.
4. **Policy Implications**: Political parties often analyze exit polls to identify the issues voters care about. This can inform policy development and campaign strategies in future elections.

### Challenges and Limitations

While exit polls offer useful insights, they have notable limitations and challenges:
1. **Sampling Errors**: If sampling is not representative of the population, exit polls may misrepresent the actual voting outcome. Errors in selecting polling stations or demographic weighting can lead to inaccurate predictions.
2. **Non-Response Bias**: Some voters may refuse to disclose their choice or may provide misleading information, skewing results. This bias is particularly relevant in regions with sensitive political climates.
3. **Timing and Legal Restrictions**: In some countries, exit poll results cannot be broadcast until after polling ends to avoid influencing ongoing voting. In India, for instance, exit polls can only be released after the last phase of polling concludes.
4. **Complex Voting Systems**: In countries with complex or multi-layered voting systems, like India’s multi-phase elections, exit polls must account for regional differences and phase-wise voting patterns, making accurate predictions challenging.

### Exit Polls in India

In India, exit polls have gained prominence over the years, especially due to the multi-phase elections and the diverse electorate. The Election Commission of India (ECI) regulates the timing of exit polls, ensuring they are released only after the last phase of voting. This is intended to prevent exit polls from swaying voters in subsequent phases. In past elections, exit polls in India have had mixed success, with varying accuracy in predicting outcomes across different states and regions. They often closely align with trends in urban areas, while rural patterns can be harder to capture due to logistical and sampling challenges.

### Public Reaction and Impact

The release of exit polls sparks public excitement and media attention, often influencing stock markets, public discussions, and even political strategies for potential coalitions or alliances. However, political parties approach exit polls with caution, as they are aware of potential inaccuracies. Instances where exit polls have significantly diverged from actual results serve as reminders of their inherent limitations.

### Conclusion

Exit polls provide valuable insights into voter behavior and electoral trends, playing an important role in democratic societies. However, they must be interpreted carefully, keeping in mind their limitations and potential for error. While exit polls can help predict trends, they are not substitutes for final vote counts, which ultimately determine the outcome. Exit polls, despite their challenges, continue to be a crucial element of modern elections, shaping narratives and helping citizens engage with the democratic process.

> Exit polls are surveys conducted post-voting to predict election outcomes and analyze voter behavior. These polls provide early insights by gathering data from voters at polling stations and are widely followed by media, analysts, and the public. Key functions of exit polls include understanding demographic voting patterns and influencing public discourse. However, exit polls have limitations like sampling errors, non-response bias, and complex regional voting patterns, making accuracy challenging. In India, exit polls can only be released after the final voting phase to prevent influence on ongoing phases. While valuable, exit polls are ultimately only preliminary indicators until official results.

# Maithili missed out on classical status as proposal did not come from Bihar govt.

This month, five languages were awarded classical language status in India, but Maithili missed out due to procedural issues. Despite a comprehensive 300-page proposal for Maithili’s recognition prepared by the Patna-based Maithili Sahitya Sansthan, it was not officially forwarded to the Union Home Ministry by the Bihar government, a necessary step in the process. According to committee sources, the Linguistics Expert Committee, which includes representatives from the Ministries of Home and Culture and linguistic experts led by the Sahitya Akademi president, evaluates such proposals. Upon the committee’s recommendation, the proposal is then reviewed by the Union Cabinet, and a Gazette notification is issued if approved.

### Criteria for Classical Status

In India, languages granted classical status enjoy special recognition and funding for academic and research initiatives to preserve and promote linguistic heritage. However, this status requires a formal, multi-step process. The Linguistics Expert Committee evaluates languages based on criteria like antiquity, a rich literary heritage, and cultural impact. Once the committee agrees, the proposal moves to the Union Cabinet, where it is finalized and published in the Gazette, thus officially according classical status. 

The current lapse was procedural rather than based on merit. The Bihar government’s failure to forward the proposal meant that Maithili, despite being discussed, could not be formally considered for classical status.

### Maithili: A Language of Significance

With a speaker base of about 12 million in India per the 2011 Census, Maithili holds significant cultural and historical importance. It was officially recognized in the Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution in 2003 and is also an optional subject in the UPSC civil services examination, reflecting its academic and cultural value. In 2018, Jharkhand granted Maithili second official language status, joining Bihar in honoring the language. In Nepal, Maithili is the second most spoken language, highlighting its cross-border influence and importance in the cultural fabric of the Indian subcontinent.

### The Path Forward for Maithili’s Classical Status

Given the rich literary tradition of Maithili, stakeholders advocate for reinitiating the proposal for classical language status. Recognition as a classical language would enable Maithili to access funds for academic research, specialized projects, and preservation initiatives, preserving its legacy and promoting its cultural influence.

The delay in the proposal process reflects the complexities of bureaucratic procedures in language recognition. Moving forward, supporters of Maithili hope the Bihar government will officially advance the proposal, allowing Maithili to gain the classical status it deserves.

### Conclusion

The missed opportunity for Maithili’s classical status underscores the importance of adhering to procedural requirements for language recognition. While Maithili’s rich history and broad speaker base make it eligible, the oversight by the Bihar government has temporarily delayed its journey. The language remains crucial to the cultural heritage of Bihar, Jharkhand, and Nepal, and its proponents continue to seek recognition for its historical and linguistic contributions. By securing classical status, Maithili could gain enhanced resources and support for its preservation and promotion, ensuring its legacy endures for future generations.

> Maithili missed out on receiving classical language status recently due to a procedural lapse, as the Bihar government failed to forward the official proposal to the Union Home Ministry. Although the Patna-based Maithili Sahitya Sansthan prepared a comprehensive proposal, it was not formally submitted, preventing consideration by the Linguistics Expert Committee. With around 12 million speakers in India, Maithili holds cultural significance, recognized in the Eighth Schedule and as an optional UPSC subject. Supporters urge Bihar to advance the proposal, which could enable Maithili to access research funding and preservation efforts, helping maintain its linguistic and cultural heritage.

# Shah unveils mobile app for birth and death registration

Union Home Minister Amit Shah recently unveiled the Civil Registration System (CRS) mobile application, aiming to enhance governance through technology. This app is designed to streamline the registration process for births and deaths, allowing citizens to register these events conveniently from anywhere and at any time. The application supports multiple languages, accommodating registration in each State's official language to ensure accessibility for users from diverse linguistic backgrounds.

The launch of the CRS app marks a significant step toward digitizing public services, aligning with the government’s Digital India initiative to make services more efficient and accessible. Traditionally, registering births and deaths required visiting local government offices, dealing with paperwork, and often enduring delays. By transitioning to a digital format, the CRS app simplifies this process, reducing the need for physical visits, cutting down on paperwork, and ensuring quicker access to crucial documents. 

Through this application, individuals can now report a birth or death by logging into the app and submitting required information and documents digitally. The app offers tracking features, allowing users to monitor the status of their application and receive notifications upon successful registration. For citizens, this means reduced dependency on intermediaries and greater convenience, especially for those in remote or rural areas.

The CRS app not only benefits individual citizens but also enhances data accuracy and centralization for government agencies. A streamlined digital system helps in maintaining a comprehensive database, which can assist in planning and implementing welfare programs. Real-time data on births and deaths enables the government to track demographic trends, which is crucial for effective policy-making in health, education, and social welfare. Additionally, accurate records of vital statistics are essential for determining resource allocation across regions and ensuring efficient delivery of benefits.

The launch of the CRS app is also significant in the context of India’s goals to improve record-keeping and statistical accuracy in civil registration, aligning with international standards. By integrating technology into this essential civic service, the government aims to address gaps in registration, particularly in regions with historically low registration rates due to accessibility challenges.

In conclusion, the Civil Registration System mobile application promises a transformative approach to civil registration in India. By making the process more accessible, efficient, and accurate, the app addresses longstanding challenges in vital statistics registration. This shift not only improves service delivery for citizens but also supports better governance and informed decision-making across various sectors. As India continues to embrace digital governance, the CRS app sets a model for future technology-driven solutions in public administration.

> Union Home Minister Amit Shah launched the Civil Registration System (CRS) mobile app to simplify the registration of births and deaths. The app allows citizens to register these events from anywhere, at any time, in their State’s official language, making the process more accessible and hassle-free. By digitizing civil registration, the app reduces reliance on physical paperwork and office visits, benefiting rural and remote areas especially. The centralized, real-time data supports accurate record-keeping and aids in policy planning across health, education, and welfare sectors. This initiative reflects the government’s commitment to technology-driven governance under the Digital India mission.

# What is clicking on the U.S. presidential campaign trail

Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are so far apart that only a continental drift can bring them closer. It is not just that one is African-American and the other White. Or that one is a woman and the other is a man. Or that Kamala Harris is a Californian and Donald Trump a New Yorker. More significantly, Kamala Harris’s campaign is leveraged on a diminishing statistic while Mr. Trump’s is set on an ascending one.

The two campaigns

Abortion rights are topmost on Ms. Harris’s to-do list, but how pressing is that? The rate of abortion has fallen steadily in the United States since the 1970s when the verdict in Roe vs Wade was passed. Legalising abortion did not result in more abortions, as some of the opponents to the judgment feared. Nor was there a dramatic increase in abortion clinics.

While abortion rates are falling, immigration, which is Mr. Trump’s cause, is rising. The immigration acts of 1965 and 1990 allowed Latin Americans and Asians in and, since then, the bulk of U.S. migrants have been Mexicans. There is a sharp rise too in unauthorised migrants who, today, comprise about 25% of foreign-born people in the U.S.

Between 1981 and 2021, abortion rates fell in the U.S. from 29.3 per 1,000 women in the 15-44 year age range to 11.6 abortions per 1,000 women. The fall is not because some States have put restrictions on abortion but rather on account of highly effective contraceptive methods, such as the intrauterine device. Also, more women seek careers now rather than raising children.

To then peg an election campaign primarily on abortion does not resonate with women the way it used to in the 1970s. No doubt, abortions still happen, often forcing women to travel, under duress, from their home State, which restricts abortion, to another where it is allowed. This can result in fatalities, but not at an overwhelming rate. Paradoxically, women beyond the child-bearing age are very committed to bringing abortion rights back simply because they fought for it in the 1970s. It was a great advance then not only because unwanted pregnancies were high but also because single parents could now pay greater attention to child rearing than child bearing.

The tirade against migrants

In contrast to the pre-1965 profile where most migrants were White, today about 50% of immigrants to the US are from Latin America, and as much as a quarter from Mexico alone. This probably explains why Mr. Trump’s tirade against migrants from south of the border is so appealing. There are so many of them and they all look so different.

In 2022, about 10.6 million immigrants (or 23% of all immigrants in the U.S.) were Mexicans. Next were those from India (6%) and China (5%). Though 77% of immigrants are in the U.S. legally, about 25%, mostly Mexicans, are unauthorised. This was not so till 1968 when primarily Europeans and the British could enter the U.S.

Donald Trump’s grandfather was an immigrant from Germany and got in easily. Yet, he hid this ancestry for, in those days, Germans were looked down upon, much like the Mexicans are today. However, time and skin colour have erased that memory, and their descendants, like Donald Trump, have low tolerance for latter day Latin America migrants.

As the presence of migrants is combustible, all of them are clubbed together for the authorised ones are not bodily stamped. Fighting for the cause of migrants then becomes a huge altruistic effort for they cannot fight for themselves. It is home advantage for those who rally behind the “Make America Great Again” banner.

This is also the reason why Mr. Trump does not have a full cast of celebrities on stage with him. His cause needs no translation into everyday tongue. Any attempt to undermine the huge presence of unauthorised migrants will be met instantly with hostility and disbelief. Unsurprisingly, Ms. Harris tends to wander when confronted with this issue.

As abortion rights actively matter to fewer women today, Democrats are forced to frame this demand in terms of rights and that always needs explanation. As Ms. Harris readily cedes ground on this if religious leaders intervene, the moral ownership of that right is vastly weakened. When law and morality clash, morality usually wins.

That is why Ms. Harris is usually part of an elaborate ensemble in public with entertainers such as Bruce Springsteen, Usher, Lizzie, and now even Beyoncé. Barack Obama is also pushing for her onstage, and so has Michelle Obama. In the medley, one is likely to lose sight of the lead actor, Kamala Harris herself; she gets lost in the crowd.

In totality

The polls say it is an even fight but Ms. Harris’s camp is working much harder as a lot of their trek is uphill. Mr. Trump, in contrast, is on cruise control and travels light. He is the star of the show — an entertainer and political leader in one handy wrap. If he has somebody else on stage, that will be a side order. Nobody eclipses him when his show comes on.

In recent memory, the contrasting styles of the finalists has never been so stark. This is all because of the cause each one promotes. Ms. Harris’s case is loaded with itsy-bitsy, fading numbers that need a regimen of grey cells to arrange. Mr. Trump’s appeal has a gut feel that requires little explanation. He sets your heart thumping, so your brain can rest.

Somewhere along the line, by intuition or by luck, Mr. Trump has mastered the art of keeping it simple, even if it seems stupid. That is politics.

> On the U.S. presidential campaign trail, key issues shaping voter opinions and campaign strategies include the economy, healthcare, immigration, climate change, and gun control. Economic concerns like inflation and job stability are at the forefront, with candidates emphasizing plans to strengthen the middle class. Healthcare reform remains critical, particularly regarding access and affordability. Immigration policies continue to be polarizing, with candidates proposing contrasting approaches on border control and pathways to citizenship. Climate change actions are increasingly relevant, especially among younger voters, while gun control debates also persist, driven by ongoing gun violence. Each issue influences campaign agendas and voter engagement across diverse demographics.

# A picture of a growing economic divide in India

In September, the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM) released a report, *Relative Economic Performance of Indian States: 1960-61 to 2023-24*, highlighting the contribution of each Indian state to national income and per capita income relative to the all-India average. The report provides insights into the economic importance of each state and reflects the well-being of their citizens. However, this aggregate data often masks regional disparities within states, indicating that while certain areas are prosperous, others struggle economically. For instance, Maharashtra is a major economic contributor with a per capita income 150% above the national average. Yet, there are vast disparities within the state, from the affluent Mumbai to poverty-stricken regions like Vidarbha, where farmer suicides are common due to economic hardship. Mumbai itself, while wealthy and contributing significantly to direct taxes, also faces severe inequalities, with millions living in sprawling slums and poor living conditions.

### Regional Economic Disparities

The report identifies a persistent trend in the regional economic divide across India. The western and southern states consistently outperform the rest of the country in terms of economic growth and per capita income, while eastern states and some northern states, excluding Haryana and Delhi, lag behind. This growing divide in economic performance between regions is a matter of concern for a diverse and federal nation like India.

The prosperous states in the west and south have been able to develop more robust economies, driven by sectors like technology, manufacturing, finance, and services. On the other hand, the eastern states, with historically lower levels of industrialization and investment, face challenges like slower economic growth, lower per capita incomes, and higher poverty rates.

### Implications of Regional Inequality

The disparities in economic performance and income between states and regions can have significant socio-economic implications. Regional inequality affects access to opportunities, quality of life, and social cohesion. For instance:
1. **Migration Pressures**: People from economically weaker states migrate to more prosperous states in search of better job opportunities, often leading to overcrowding, strained infrastructure, and social tensions in host states.
2. **Impact on Social Welfare**: Higher income disparities contribute to uneven access to healthcare, education, and public services, with economically weaker states often struggling to provide adequate resources to their populations.
3. **Challenges for Federal Balance**: Persistent regional disparities create challenges for India’s federal system, where the goal is balanced economic development across all states.

### Addressing Regional Disparities

To bridge the economic divide, targeted policy interventions are needed:
1. **Promoting Investment in Lagging Regions**: Incentives for industries to set up in the eastern and less-developed northern states could stimulate economic activity and job creation.
2. **Enhancing Infrastructure**: Better infrastructure, including roads, digital connectivity, and energy access, is essential for economic development in underperforming regions.
3. **Skill Development and Education**: By improving educational outcomes and providing skill training, weaker states can enhance workforce capabilities, attracting investment and creating local employment.
4. **Decentralized Planning**: State-specific economic strategies can help address unique challenges and leverage local strengths, promoting more balanced development across India.

### Conclusion

The EAC-PM report highlights significant disparities in the economic performance of Indian states, pointing to a growing divide between the prosperous west and south, and the lagging east and some northern regions. This divide underlines the need for balanced economic policies that address regional inequalities, fostering inclusive growth. A concerted effort toward equitable development can promote stability and sustain India’s economic growth, ensuring that all regions contribute meaningfully to the country’s prosperity and that the benefits of growth reach every citizen.

> The EAC-PM report, *Relative Economic Performance of Indian States: 1960-61 to 2023-24*, highlights regional disparities in India’s economic landscape. While western and southern states perform well, eastern and most northern states lag behind, creating a growing economic divide. Maharashtra, for instance, has a high per capita income, yet stark internal inequalities exist between affluent Mumbai and poorer regions like Vidarbha. This regional divide affects migration, social welfare, and strains federal balance. Addressing it requires targeted policies, investment in lagging regions, infrastructure upgrades, and skill development, aiming for balanced, inclusive growth to ensure all states contribute to national prosperity.

# Two programmes launched to fuel growth of start-ups in State

The Karnataka government has introduced two major programs—ELEVATE 2024 and the Karnataka Acceleration Network (KAN)—aimed at supporting early and growth-stage start-ups within the state. These initiatives focus on addressing the critical funding and resource challenges faced by start-ups, thus fostering a conducive environment for innovation, job creation, and economic growth.

### ELEVATE 2024: Supporting Early-Stage Start-ups

ELEVATE 2024 is a grant-in-aid seed funding initiative tailored to empower early-stage start-ups in Karnataka. The program provides up to ₹50 lakh in grant funding per start-up, which can help alleviate the initial financial burdens many new businesses face. The grant aims to support innovative ideas with the potential for growth but lacking the necessary financial backing to get off the ground.

Under ELEVATE 2024, start-ups are not only provided with financial support but also gain access to a range of additional resources:
1. **Incubation Facilities**: Start-ups selected for ELEVATE gain access to incubation centers, which provide office spaces, resources, and opportunities to network and collaborate with other start-ups and innovators. Such an environment fosters creativity and allows entrepreneurs to focus on product development and scaling.
2. **Expert Mentorship**: The program offers access to industry experts who can provide crucial guidance on navigating the start-up ecosystem, refining business models, and making strategic decisions. Mentorship from seasoned entrepreneurs and domain specialists helps new businesses avoid common pitfalls and accelerates their growth potential.
3. **Access to Venture Capital Networks**: To help start-ups transition from early-stage funding to larger investment opportunities, ELEVATE 2024 provides them with exposure to venture capital (VC) networks.

### Karnataka Acceleration Network (KAN): A Growth-Stage Accelerator

KAN, or the Karnataka Acceleration Network, is specifically designed to support growth-stage start-ups that have moved beyond the early-stage phase and are now seeking to scale operations, expand market reach, and achieve sustainable growth. KAN offers:
1. **Funding Opportunities**: While KAN does not directly provide grants, it connects start-ups with a network of potential investors, helping them secure larger funding rounds. This network is especially beneficial for start-ups looking to expand beyond the local market and establish a more substantial presence.
2. **Market Access and Expansion**: One of the core benefits of KAN is facilitating market access, both domestically and potentially internationally. By leveraging government partnerships and established business networks, start-ups gain opportunities to enter new markets and reach more customers.
3. **Ongoing Mentorship and Strategic Guidance**: Unlike early-stage mentorship, KAN’s guidance focuses on strategies for scaling, handling rapid growth, and managing operational challenges. This mentorship is tailored to the needs of maturing start-ups that require different insights compared to early-stage businesses.

### Vision and Impact

Minister Priyank Kharge, speaking at a media conference, explained that both ELEVATE 2024 and KAN align with Karnataka’s broader mission to support and develop a thriving start-up ecosystem. The programs reflect the government’s commitment to fostering entrepreneurship and innovation within the state, which already boasts one of India’s most vibrant start-up communities.

Through these initiatives, Karnataka aims to address a significant gap in start-up funding and resources, particularly for early-stage ventures, which often struggle to find adequate financial support. By providing start-ups with both funding and strategic support, the government seeks to create an ecosystem where local innovations can flourish, potentially making Karnataka a leading start-up hub not just within India but globally.

Additionally, these programs are expected to contribute positively to Karnataka’s economy, creating jobs, attracting skilled talent, and encouraging the development of technology-driven solutions across sectors. They will also likely improve Karnataka's appeal to domestic and international investors, establishing the state as a premier destination for start-up activity in India.

### Conclusion

The launch of ELEVATE 2024 and KAN represents a strategic move by the Karnataka government to bolster the state’s start-up ecosystem by addressing funding, mentorship, and market access needs. ELEVATE 2024 offers essential seed funding and incubation for early-stage start-ups, while KAN supports scaling and market entry for growth-stage businesses. Together, these programs aim to create a comprehensive support framework that nurtures innovation, drives economic growth, and enhances Karnataka's reputation as a dynamic start-up destination.

> The Karnataka government launched two initiatives, ELEVATE 2024 and the Karnataka Acceleration Network (KAN), to support start-ups at different growth stages. ELEVATE 2024 provides up to ₹50 lakh in grants to early-stage start-ups, along with incubation, mentorship, and access to venture capital networks. KAN targets growth-stage start-ups, offering mentorship, market access, and connections to investors for further expansion. These programs aim to overcome funding and resource challenges, fostering innovation, job creation, and economic growth. Together, ELEVATE 2024 and KAN strengthen Karnataka’s start-up ecosystem, positioning the state as a top start-up hub in India and a global innovation center.

# PM rolls out health cover for persons aged 70 and above

In a significant expansion of the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY), Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that all senior citizens aged 70 and above will now receive health coverage under the scheme, irrespective of income. This policy shift aims to provide comprehensive healthcare access to millions of elderly citizens, who are among the most vulnerable due to age-related health challenges and often limited financial resources. The move underscores the government’s focus on inclusivity and equitable healthcare access, extending the scope of PM-JAY, which is already the world's largest government-funded health insurance scheme.

### Ayushman Bharat PM-JAY: A Brief Overview
Launched in 2018, Ayushman Bharat PM-JAY is a flagship health insurance scheme by the Government of India, providing financial protection for secondary and tertiary healthcare services. Under this scheme, eligible families receive health coverage of up to ₹5 lakh per family per year, covering treatment costs in empanelled hospitals for a range of services, including major surgeries, chronic diseases, and cancer treatment. Initially targeted at economically weaker sections, PM-JAY has expanded over the years to cover more citizens, reflecting the government’s commitment to ensuring universal healthcare.

### Significance of the Expansion for Senior Citizens
The inclusion of senior citizens aged 70 and above, regardless of income, is a critical step, as this demographic faces unique healthcare challenges. The elderly are more prone to chronic diseases, comorbidities, and age-related conditions requiring ongoing medical attention. Many senior citizens, especially those who are retired, have limited or no regular income, making healthcare costs burdensome. By expanding PM-JAY to cover these citizens, the government is alleviating a significant financial burden, enabling them to access quality healthcare without financial distress.

This initiative addresses both economic and social dimensions:
1. **Financial Security**: Elderly citizens often rely on fixed savings or limited pensions, which can quickly be depleted by medical expenses. Free health coverage allows them to access necessary care without compromising their financial security.
2. **Social Welfare**: This policy highlights the government’s recognition of the elderly’s social value and aims to promote dignity in old age. By removing the income criterion, the policy reinforces inclusivity, ensuring even those who do not fall into economically weaker categories can receive assistance.

### Implementation and Challenges
With this expanded coverage, the government will need to address several challenges:
1. **Increased Demand on Healthcare Infrastructure**: The inclusion of millions more citizens under PM-JAY will increase demand for healthcare services, especially in empanelled hospitals. Ensuring that facilities can handle this rise in demand, both in rural and urban areas, will be essential to maintain quality and timely care.
2. **Awareness and Access**: Educating senior citizens, particularly those in rural areas, about the benefits and processes of PM-JAY is crucial for effective utilization. Since many elderly individuals may not be digitally savvy, additional offline outreach efforts will be required to ensure accessibility.
3. **Funding and Budget**: This expansion entails increased costs for the government. To maintain sustainability, the government may need to reassess funding allocations and streamline processes to manage costs without compromising care quality.
4. **Monitoring and Fraud Prevention**: As the scheme grows, monitoring compliance and preventing misuse or fraud will be vital to safeguard resources. Implementing robust oversight mechanisms will help ensure that benefits reach the intended beneficiaries.

### Broader Implications for Healthcare in India
The expansion of PM-JAY to include all senior citizens marks a milestone in India’s journey toward universal healthcare coverage. This move aligns with the goals of Ayushman Bharat, which seeks to address healthcare access and equity on a national scale. As India progresses toward achieving universal healthcare, this expansion demonstrates the government’s commitment to inclusive policies that protect vulnerable populations.

In conclusion, the inclusion of all senior citizens under PM-JAY signifies a major stride in India’s healthcare system, prioritizing vulnerable groups and addressing their specific needs. With continued efforts to strengthen healthcare infrastructure and outreach, this expansion promises to create a more resilient, inclusive, and equitable healthcare landscape across India.

> Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that Ayushman Bharat PM-JAY health coverage will now include all senior citizens aged 70 and above, regardless of income, aiming to provide financial relief and healthcare access to India’s elderly. This expansion helps address age-related health issues and reduces the financial burden on retirees with limited income. Challenges include managing increased demand on healthcare infrastructure, raising awareness among rural elderly, and ensuring funding sustainability. This policy shift advances India’s progress toward universal healthcare, reflecting the government’s commitment to inclusive, equitable healthcare access and social welfare for the country’s aging population.
