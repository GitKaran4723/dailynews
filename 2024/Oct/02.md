# Iran fires missiles at Israel, warns against retaliation

On Tuesday, Iran launched a barrage of **ballistic missiles** at Israel, marking a significant escalation in regional tensions. The missile attack was reportedly in **retaliation for Israel’s military operations** targeting Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed militant group based in Lebanon. This exchange comes amid heightened hostilities between Israel and its adversaries in the region, including Hezbollah, which plays a pivotal role in Lebanon's political and military landscape and serves as a key ally of Tehran.

Alarms sounded across Israel, sending citizens rushing into **bomb shelters** as missiles descended on various locations, including **Jerusalem** and the **Jordan River Valley**. The impact of the strikes was felt immediately, with explosions echoing in the affected areas. The Israeli government, equipped with one of the world’s most advanced anti-missile defense systems, **Iron Dome**, attempted to intercept some of the incoming missiles, although details on the success rate of the interceptions have yet to be confirmed.

The missile strikes followed Israel’s ongoing operations against Hezbollah positions in Lebanon. Hezbollah, with strong financial and military support from Iran, has been a long-standing adversary of Israel. Over the years, Hezbollah’s role in regional conflicts, particularly its involvement in the Syrian Civil War and its fortified presence along Lebanon’s southern border with Israel, has made it a direct target for Israeli military campaigns.

The scale and intensity of Iran’s missile salvo underline the growing tensions in the **Middle East**, where multiple conflicts intersect, often pulling in external players. Israel’s air defense forces and military apparatus were on full alert following the missile attacks, with reports indicating that citizens across the country, including media personnel, were forced to take shelter. Footage broadcast on state television showed reporters lying flat on the ground for safety during live broadcasts, further reflecting the gravity of the situation.

This escalation is part of a broader regional power struggle between **Iran** and **Israel**, with Hezbollah acting as a proxy force for Tehran. Iran's ballistic missile capabilities, which have been the subject of international scrutiny and sanctions, are a major component of its military strategy in countering perceived threats from Israel and its allies.

As tensions continue to mount, the missile strike raises concerns about a potential wider conflict in the region, with international observers urging for de-escalation to prevent further violence.

The missile exchange between **Iran and Israel** has significant implications for both **India** and the **world**, particularly in terms of regional stability, energy security, and global diplomacy.

### **Impact on India**

1. **Energy Security**: India is heavily dependent on the **Middle East for oil imports**, with countries like Iran being key suppliers in the past. Any escalation of conflict in the region could disrupt oil supplies, leading to **rising oil prices** and increased import costs. Higher energy prices could contribute to inflationary pressures on India's economy, affecting industries and consumers alike.

2. **Strategic Balancing**: India maintains **strong diplomatic relations with Israel**, having cooperated on defense, agriculture, and technology. At the same time, India also has historically important ties with **Iran**, especially concerning energy security and the development of the **Chabahar port**. India will likely need to carefully navigate its position without alienating either party, especially given the geopolitical complexities of the region.

3. **Indian Diaspora**: There are millions of **Indians working in the Middle East**, and any escalation could pose risks to their safety and livelihoods. In the event of a broader conflict, India may need to evacuate its citizens, similar to past efforts during conflicts in West Asia.

### **Impact on the World**

1. **Global Energy Markets**: The Middle East is a major supplier of **global oil** and **natural gas**, and any disruptions could lead to a **global energy crisis**. This could result in a sharp rise in global oil prices, exacerbating inflation, especially for energy-dependent economies like those in Europe and Asia.

2. **Escalation of Regional Conflicts**: An Iran-Israel conflict could further destabilize the **Middle East**, potentially dragging in regional powers like **Saudi Arabia** and **Turkey**, as well as global superpowers such as the **United States** and **Russia**. This would likely worsen humanitarian crises in countries like **Syria**, **Lebanon**, and **Yemen**.

3. **Global Diplomacy**: The conflict may complicate ongoing diplomatic efforts, such as the **Iran Nuclear Deal** (JCPOA). A deteriorating situation could also increase tensions between the **U.S.** and **Iran**, potentially affecting diplomatic relationships worldwide, including with countries attempting to mediate or maintain neutrality.

4. **Terrorism and Security**: A rise in regional tensions could spur **proxy conflicts** and embolden **militant groups** like Hezbollah, leading to an uptick in terrorist activities in neighboring regions. This would have far-reaching effects on global security, increasing instability and requiring nations to bolster counterterrorism measures.

In summary, the conflict between **Iran and Israel** presents significant challenges for India and the world, primarily in terms of **energy security**, **regional stability**, and **diplomatic balancing**. The potential for broader conflict in the Middle East could disrupt global markets and strain international relations, especially in an already tense geopolitical landscape.

> Iran launched a **ballistic missile attack** on Israel in retaliation for Israel's military actions against Tehran-backed Hezbollah forces in Lebanon. The missile strikes triggered **air raid alarms** across Israel, including in **Jerusalem** and the **Jordan River Valley**, forcing residents to seek shelter. Explosions were heard, and footage showed reporters on state television lying flat for safety during live broadcasts. Israel's **Iron Dome** defense system attempted to intercept the missiles. This escalation highlights the deepening conflict between **Iran** and **Israel**, with growing concerns of a broader regional conflict involving Hezbollah and other Iranian proxies.

# The Waqf Bill 2024 is one that needs review

The **Waqf Bill 2024**, which seeks to introduce certain reforms in the administration of waqf properties, faces criticism for infringing on established norms of religious management and representation. The concerns stem from comparisons with existing laws such as the **Uttar Pradesh Sri Kashi Vishwanath Temple Act, 1983**, which outlines specific regulations about the religious identity of those involved in temple management. Under this Act, it is explicitly stated that **non-Hindus** are not eligible to be part of the temple's management at any level. Additionally, if any of the specified officials, such as government Secretaries, Varanasi’s Collector, or Commissioner, is non-Hindu, the next eligible Hindu officer in the hierarchy shall be appointed to the Board. 

### **Context of Religious Management in India**

India has a unique and pluralistic approach to religious management, and the laws governing different religious institutions vary based on their historical and regional contexts. For Hindu temples, as seen in the Sri Kashi Vishwanath Temple Act, there are strict guidelines that limit the participation of non-Hindus in temple management. These restrictions exist to ensure that the administration and preservation of the religious and cultural practices are carried out in accordance with Hindu traditions and beliefs. Similar laws are present in other states concerning the management of prominent temples.

### **Infringement Concerns with the Waqf Bill 2024**

The **Waqf Bill 2024**, in contrast, introduces reforms in the administration of **waqf properties**, which are endowments made by Muslims for religious or charitable purposes. Waqf boards, which manage these properties, traditionally consist of Muslim members. The criticism arises from the perception that the Bill may allow for non-Muslims to be involved in the management of waqf properties, or may infringe on the autonomy of waqf boards. This, critics argue, would be inconsistent with the principles of religious autonomy upheld in laws like the Sri Kashi Vishwanath Temple Act.

In addition to concerns over religious representation, there are broader apprehensions about potential government interference in the administration of waqf properties. Critics fear that this could undermine the community-driven nature of waqf boards, which are responsible for managing vast properties and ensuring that their proceeds are used for the designated religious and charitable purposes.

### **Comparative Religious Governance**

While Hindu temple management laws explicitly ensure that only Hindus are involved in the administration, Muslim waqf properties traditionally follow a similar principle of internal governance. The Waqf Bill 2024 is seen by some as deviating from this norm, potentially opening up avenues for non-Muslim participation or greater government control. This divergence from religious self-governance contrasts with the autonomy granted to temple boards, raising concerns about equity in the treatment of religious communities.

### **Legal and Social Implications**

The debate surrounding the Waqf Bill 2024 touches upon broader themes of religious freedom, community autonomy, and the state's role in managing religious institutions. Critics argue that any dilution of waqf autonomy could set a concerning precedent, not just for Muslim religious institutions but also for other communities. The balance between **state oversight** and **religious self-governance** is a sensitive issue in a multi-religious country like India, and any perceived infringement on this balance can have significant social and political repercussions.

### **Conclusion**

The **Waqf Bill 2024** faces opposition over concerns that it may infringe upon religious autonomy, particularly when compared to existing laws like the **Uttar Pradesh Sri Kashi Vishwanath Temple Act**, which safeguard religious representation. The controversy highlights the delicate balance between state involvement and religious governance, a balance that is crucial to maintaining harmony in India's diverse social fabric.

The **Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024**, introduced in the **Lok Sabha** in August 2024, proposes significant changes to the governance of **Waqf properties** in India. It aims to enhance transparency, accountability, and efficiency in the management of these properties, which are endowments made for religious or charitable purposes under **Islamic law**.

### Key Changes:
1. **Removal of Waqf by User**: The bill removes the recognition of waqf properties based on long-term use, clarifying that only properties declared by a practicing Muslim for at least five years can be designated as waqf, with mandatory ownership requirements.
   
2. **Government Property**: Any **government property** identified as waqf will revert to state ownership, with the **Collector** responsible for determining the property's status in case of disputes.

3. **Centralized Management**: The bill proposes transferring the power to survey and manage waqf properties from **Waqf Boards** to **state collectors**, bringing waqf governance under **state revenue laws**.

4. **Composition of Waqf Boards**: It allows the inclusion of **non-Muslims** in Waqf Boards and mandates the inclusion of representatives from various Muslim sects, ensuring diversity. This provision has been a point of contention, as it contrasts with traditional Waqf Board structures that were exclusively Muslim.

5. **Appeal Mechanisms**: Tribunal decisions related to waqf properties can now be appealed to the **High Court**, which is a departure from the previous system where tribunal decisions were final.

6. **Increased Government Oversight**: The bill gives the **central government** the power to audit waqf accounts, set regulations, and appoint members to Waqf Boards, aiming to curb mismanagement but raising concerns about increased government control.

The bill has sparked debate, with some viewing it as necessary for reform and others criticizing it for potentially infringing on the autonomy of Waqf institutions. The proposal to include non-Muslim members in Waqf Boards has particularly drawn criticism from various quarters.

> The **Waqf Bill 2024** faces criticism for potential infringements on religious autonomy, as it may allow non-Muslims or the government to interfere in the management of **waqf properties**, which are traditionally administered by Muslims. Comparisons are drawn to the **Uttar Pradesh Sri Kashi Vishwanath Temple Act, 1983**, which ensures that only Hindus manage the temple’s affairs. The bill raises concerns about equity and religious freedom, as critics argue that it could undermine the community-driven nature of waqf boards. This controversy underscores the broader issue of balancing **state oversight** and **religious governance** in India’s diverse society.
