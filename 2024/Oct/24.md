# Cyberfraud losses could amount to 0.7% of GDP, projects Ministry’s study

India is facing a significant threat from cyberfrauds, with projections indicating potential losses of over ₹1.2 lakh crore (approximately $15 billion) over the next year. This alarming forecast comes from the **Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C)**, which operates under the **Union Home Ministry**. Cybercrimes in India have seen a sharp rise in recent years, fueled by the increasing digitization of financial transactions, growing internet penetration, and the expanding use of smartphones. While technological advancements have brought numerous benefits, they have also opened up new avenues for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities in both personal and institutional systems.

### Growth of Cybercrime in India

India has witnessed a steady increase in cybercrime, with cases ranging from **phishing attacks**, **identity theft**, and **financial fraud** to more sophisticated crimes like **ransomware attacks** and **corporate data breaches**. The growing reliance on digital platforms, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, accelerated this trend. Many people, especially in rural areas, embraced online payment systems without fully understanding the risks involved, making them more vulnerable to cyberfraud.

According to the I4C’s projection, the losses caused by cyberfraud will stem from a variety of sources, including personal data theft, unauthorized financial transactions, and other forms of digital deception. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), individual consumers, and even large corporations are increasingly being targeted by cybercriminals. The **National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB)** reported over 52,000 cases of cybercrime in India in 2021, a number that is expected to rise as the use of digital tools expands.

### Common Forms of Cyberfraud

1. **Phishing Attacks**: Phishing is one of the most common forms of cybercrime, where fraudsters use fake emails, messages, or websites to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information like passwords, bank account details, and credit card numbers. Despite awareness campaigns, phishing scams continue to be highly effective, particularly when fraudsters impersonate trusted institutions like banks or government agencies.

2. **Financial Fraud**: Online financial fraud includes unauthorized transactions, fraudulent digital payments, and hacking into individuals' bank accounts or digital wallets. The rise of Unified Payments Interface (UPI)-based transactions has also seen an increase in UPI-related fraud, where criminals use social engineering techniques to manipulate victims into transferring money.

3. **Ransomware**: Ransomware attacks have been on the rise globally, including in India, where hackers infect a computer or network with malware, locking access to critical files until a ransom is paid. These attacks target individuals, businesses, and even government institutions, causing significant financial losses and operational disruptions.

4. **SIM Swap Fraud**: SIM swap fraud is a relatively new but growing form of cybercrime in India, where fraudsters trick telecom companies into transferring a victim’s phone number to a SIM card controlled by the criminal. This enables the fraudster to intercept OTPs (One-Time Passwords) and authentication codes, facilitating access to bank accounts and other sensitive information.

### Government Initiatives to Tackle Cybercrime

The Indian government, through the **Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C)**, has initiated multiple steps to combat the growing threat of cyberfraud. I4C operates as a hub for **investigating cybercrime**, raising awareness, and providing resources to law enforcement agencies across the country. The platform also encourages public-private partnerships to strengthen the cybersecurity ecosystem.

The **Cyber Crime Reporting Portal** launched by the Ministry of Home Affairs allows citizens to report cybercrimes, with a particular focus on cyberbullying, financial fraud, and crimes targeting women and children. Additionally, the **CERT-IN (Computer Emergency Response Team - India)** monitors and responds to cyber threats, providing advisories and best practices to businesses and individuals to safeguard against attacks.

### Preventive Measures

Given the projected rise in cyberfrauds, it is crucial for both individuals and organizations to adopt proactive measures to protect themselves from these crimes. Some key preventive strategies include:

1. **Raising Awareness**: Educating the public about the risks associated with online transactions and common fraud techniques is essential. Users should be cautious while sharing sensitive information online and verify the authenticity of websites and apps before making transactions.

2. **Strengthening Cybersecurity**: Businesses, especially SMEs, should invest in robust cybersecurity infrastructure, including firewalls, encryption, and regular software updates. Employees should be trained to recognize phishing attempts and other social engineering tactics.

3. **Regular Audits**: Conducting regular cybersecurity audits and implementing stringent data protection policies can help organizations identify vulnerabilities before they are exploited by cybercriminals.

### Conclusion

India is at a critical juncture in its battle against cyberfraud. As the country continues to embrace digitalization, the potential losses from cybercrime, as projected by the I4C, serve as a stark reminder of the need for heightened vigilance. Through a combination of government action, technological investment, and public awareness, India can mitigate these risks and ensure that the benefits of digital transformation are not overshadowed by its dangers.

> India is projected to lose over ₹1.2 lakh crore to cyberfrauds in the next year, according to the **Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C)** under the **Union Home Ministry**. The rise in cybercrimes is attributed to increased digitization, with common threats including **phishing**, **financial fraud**, **ransomware**, and **SIM swap fraud**. Despite government initiatives like the **Cyber Crime Reporting Portal** and **CERT-IN**, cybercrime cases are growing. The government and businesses are urged to raise awareness, strengthen cybersecurity, and implement proactive measures to prevent these losses. Public vigilance and robust infrastructure are essential in combating the increasing threat of cyberfraud.

# Celebration and vigil

India has achieved significant progress in public health by bringing **kala-azar** and **trachoma** to the brink of elimination. Kala-azar, also known as **visceral leishmaniasis**, is the second deadliest parasitic disease after malaria in India, while **trachoma**, caused by the bacteria *Chlamydia trachomatis*, is the leading infectious cause of blindness globally. India has reduced kala-azar cases to fewer than one in 10,000 people for two consecutive years, making the country eligible to seek **WHO certification** for elimination. In 2023, India recorded 595 cases and four deaths from kala-azar, while the numbers have further decreased in 2024.

Elimination differs from eradication in epidemiology; elimination means that a disease is no longer a public health problem, with cases kept under a specified limit, while eradication refers to the complete cessation of disease cases. Eradication has only been achieved with **smallpox**, and achieving elimination, particularly without vaccines, is a major public health challenge.

The **sandfly**, which carries the **Leishmania donovani** parasite, transmits kala-azar. While no vaccine exists for kala-azar or trachoma, India's public health efforts have focused on controlling the vectors and improving healthcare access. This makes the progress against both diseases particularly noteworthy. Historically, India contributed about **11.5%** of global kala-azar cases and, in the 1970s, **trachoma** was responsible for **5%** of all blindness in the country.

India must maintain its low kala-azar numbers for another year to officially eliminate the disease as a public health problem.

**Kala-azar**, also known as **visceral leishmaniasis**, is a parasitic disease caused by the **Leishmania donovani** protozoan. It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected **female sandflies** of the genus **Phlebotomus**. Kala-azar is the second deadliest parasitic disease in the world after malaria and is a major public health issue in several tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of India.

### Causes and Transmission

The **Leishmania donovani** parasite resides in the blood and internal organs like the liver, spleen, and bone marrow. Sandflies become infected by biting a person or animal already carrying the parasite. When the infected sandfly bites another person, it transmits the parasite into the bloodstream. Kala-azar is **vector-borne**, meaning it depends on the sandfly to spread, and human-to-human transmission is rare.

### Symptoms of Kala-azar

The symptoms of kala-azar typically appear between **2 to 8 months** after being bitten by an infected sandfly. The disease primarily affects the **internal organs**, and symptoms can become severe if not treated. Common symptoms include:

1. **Fever**: Persistent or recurrent fever is a hallmark of kala-azar, often spiking and accompanied by sweating.
2. **Weight loss**: Significant and rapid weight loss occurs despite a normal or increased appetite.
3. **Enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly)**: This is one of the key symptoms, along with an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly).
4. **Weakness and fatigue**: The disease causes extreme fatigue and general weakness due to its effects on internal organs.
5. **Anemia**: Kala-azar can cause severe anemia, leading to pale skin, weakness, and shortness of breath.
6. **Darkening of the skin**: This is the origin of the name “kala-azar,” which means “black fever” in Hindi.

If left untreated, visceral leishmaniasis is almost always **fatal** within 2 years due to complications such as organ failure, secondary infections, or severe anemia.

### Diagnosis and Treatment

**Diagnosis** of kala-azar involves a combination of clinical symptoms and laboratory tests. The most common diagnostic methods include:

- **Serological tests**: These detect antibodies against the parasite in the blood. The **rk39 rapid diagnostic test** is commonly used in India.
- **Microscopic examination**: Samples of blood, bone marrow, or tissue from the spleen may be examined under a microscope to detect the presence of the parasite.
- **Molecular tests**: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests can detect parasite DNA, though these are more sophisticated and less widely available in resource-limited areas.

**Treatment** for kala-azar involves **antileishmanial drugs**. The most commonly used drugs include:

- **Miltefosine**: An oral drug used as the first line of treatment for kala-azar.
- **Amphotericin B**: Given intravenously, particularly in resistant cases, it is considered the most effective treatment but requires hospitalization.
- **Sodium stibogluconate**: An older treatment, still used in some cases but associated with more side effects.
  
Early treatment significantly improves outcomes, reducing the risk of complications and mortality.

### Epidemiology

Kala-azar is found in parts of Asia, Africa, and South America. India is one of the most affected countries, accounting for a significant share of the global kala-azar burden. The disease is concentrated in **Bihar**, **Jharkhand**, **West Bengal**, and **Uttar Pradesh**, with Bihar historically reporting the highest number of cases.

**Climate and environmental factors** play a crucial role in the spread of kala-azar. Sandflies thrive in warm, humid environments, and areas with poor sanitation and crowded living conditions are particularly vulnerable to outbreaks. Agricultural activities, deforestation, and changes in water management can also contribute to increased transmission.

### Elimination Efforts

India has made significant progress toward **eliminating kala-azar** as a public health problem. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines elimination as reducing the incidence of the disease to fewer than **one case per 10,000 people** in endemic areas. India has already met this target for two consecutive years, reducing cases through a combination of **vector control** (such as insecticide spraying) and **case management**.

India's Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, in partnership with WHO and other global health organizations, has been actively working to eliminate kala-azar by strengthening healthcare infrastructure, improving access to treatment, and raising awareness about the disease.

### Challenges and Future Prospects

Despite significant progress, some challenges remain in the battle against kala-azar. These include:

- **Drug resistance**: There is growing concern about the **resistance** to antileishmanial drugs, particularly sodium stibogluconate, which complicates treatment in some areas.
- **Relapse and post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL)**: Some patients who recover from kala-azar may develop PKDL, a skin condition that can serve as a reservoir for the disease, potentially leading to further transmission.
- **Access to healthcare**: In rural and remote areas, access to timely diagnosis and treatment remains a challenge, limiting the ability to manage outbreaks.

India is on the verge of **eliminating kala-azar** as a public health issue. However, maintaining low transmission levels and preventing resurgence requires ongoing efforts in **surveillance**, **vector control**, and **healthcare access**. The elimination of kala-azar would mark a significant public health victory for the country and pave the way for addressing other neglected tropical diseases.

### Conclusion

Kala-azar is a deadly parasitic disease that has plagued India for decades. While treatment is available, early detection and effective public health interventions are essential to control its spread. India's success in reducing cases to below the elimination threshold represents a major achievement, and with continued efforts, the disease could soon cease to be a significant public health threat.

> India has made significant strides in public health by nearly eliminating **kala-azar** and **trachoma**. Kala-azar, the second deadliest parasitic disease in India, has seen cases reduced to fewer than one in 10,000 for two consecutive years, making the country eligible for **WHO certification**. In 2023, India reported 595 cases of kala-azar, with further declines in 2024. While elimination means reducing the disease to a manageable level, eradication (achieved only with smallpox) is much harder. With no vaccines for kala-azar or trachoma, India’s achievement in reducing the spread through control measures marks a crucial public health victory.

# BRICS should strengthen financial integration: PM

At the **16th BRICS Summit** held in **Kazan**, Prime Minister Narendra Modi emphasized India’s strong support for greater financial integration among the BRICS member countries—**Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa**. His remarks highlighted India's commitment to deepening economic cooperation within the bloc by fostering trade in local currencies and enhancing cross-border financial transactions. Modi’s vision for financial integration aligns with BRICS' broader goals of reducing dependence on the U.S. dollar and promoting financial sovereignty among emerging economies.

### Focus on Financial Integration

Prime Minister Modi’s call for **greater financial integration** comes at a time when BRICS countries are seeking alternatives to global financial systems dominated by Western institutions. With economic uncertainties and global financial disruptions, there is a growing push among BRICS nations to strengthen their financial architecture. Modi stated, **“We welcome efforts to increase financial integration among BRICS countries. Trade in local currencies and smooth cross-border payments will strengthen our economic cooperation.”** By promoting **trade in local currencies**, BRICS nations can mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates and reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar, which dominates global trade.

India has been a proponent of exploring alternatives to the U.S. dollar in international trade, especially in light of global economic challenges and sanctions imposed on countries like Russia. The use of local currencies in bilateral and multilateral trade between BRICS members could enhance economic stability, reduce transaction costs, and encourage more trade among these emerging economies.

Modi also stressed the importance of building a smooth and efficient **cross-border payment system** within BRICS, which would facilitate easier and faster transactions between member countries. This system would help overcome the challenges posed by sanctions, financial barriers, and currency volatility. By streamlining payments, BRICS countries can foster a more interconnected and resilient economic bloc.

### India’s Stance on International Terrorism and Middle East Tensions

In addition to financial matters, **India’s uncompromising position on international terrorism** was a key aspect of Modi’s address at the BRICS summit. Modi reiterated India’s long-standing policy of zero tolerance towards terrorism and called for global cooperation to combat this menace. His statement was made in the context of escalating violence in the **Gaza Strip** and **Lebanon**, with the BRICS nations expressing deep concern over the ongoing conflicts in the region.

The BRICS summit plenary session, while addressing these issues, took a critical stance against the recent actions of **Israel** in the Gaza Strip, blaming Israel for the **“unprecedented escalation of violence”** and expressing alarm over the deteriorating situation in Lebanon. While the BRICS nations condemned the violence, Modi used the platform to reiterate that terrorism in any form, anywhere, is unacceptable. He emphasized the need for concerted global efforts to counter terrorist activities, signaling India’s firm position against terrorism on international platforms.

India’s emphasis on combating terrorism resonates with its own challenges of dealing with cross-border terrorism, particularly from Pakistan. The BRICS summit, therefore, served as an important venue for Modi to further India’s anti-terrorism agenda and push for more coordinated action among global powers.

### Strengthening BRICS Economic Cooperation

The push for financial integration within BRICS is part of a larger strategy to enhance **economic cooperation** and **resilience** within the bloc. The BRICS countries collectively represent about 40% of the global population and around 25% of global GDP, making their economic cooperation crucial for shaping the global economy. Modi’s proposal for deeper financial ties, including the **use of local currencies** and enhanced **cross-border payment mechanisms**, aims to build a more sustainable and independent financial system for BRICS countries.

By strengthening financial ties, BRICS nations can better navigate the challenges posed by global economic uncertainties, including rising inflation, currency fluctuations, and geopolitical tensions. Enhanced financial integration can also open up new avenues for investment, innovation, and trade, thereby promoting growth and development across the bloc.

### Conclusion

Prime Minister Modi’s address at the 16th BRICS Summit highlighted India’s strong support for greater financial integration within the bloc, emphasizing the need for trade in local currencies and efficient cross-border payments. His call for enhanced economic cooperation was coupled with India’s firm stance against terrorism, reflecting India’s priorities in both financial and security domains. As BRICS continues to evolve as a significant global grouping, India’s active participation and leadership in these areas will contribute to shaping a more resilient and interconnected global economic landscape.

> At the **16th BRICS Summit** in Kazan, Prime Minister **Narendra Modi** emphasized India’s support for **greater financial integration** among BRICS nations, advocating for trade in local currencies and enhanced cross-border payment systems to strengthen economic cooperation and reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar. He also reiterated India’s uncompromising stance against **international terrorism**, urging global efforts to combat terrorism, particularly in the context of escalating violence in the **Gaza Strip** and **Lebanon**. Modi's vision for deeper financial ties and cooperation within BRICS aligns with the bloc’s broader goals of economic resilience and addressing global challenges collectively.

# Modi, Xi welcome border pact, seek to rebuild ties

In a significant diplomatic breakthrough, **Prime Minister Narendra Modi** and **Chinese President Xi Jinping** held their first formal bilateral meeting in five years, where they welcomed the recent agreement to resolve the military stand-off at the **Line of Actual Control (LAC)**. The meeting, which took place amid heightened tensions between India and China, signified a crucial step towards restoring normalcy in their relations, which have been strained since the 2020 border clash in eastern Ladakh.

### Background of the LAC Dispute

The Line of Actual Control, which serves as the de facto border between India and China, has long been a source of contention. Tensions escalated dramatically in **2020** when a violent clash in the **Galwan Valley** resulted in casualties on both sides, marking the most serious confrontation between the two nations in decades. Since then, multiple rounds of diplomatic and military talks have been held to de-escalate the situation, but a resolution had remained elusive until recently.

The **LAC stand-off** saw both nations build up significant military presence along disputed areas, particularly in eastern Ladakh, leading to a prolonged standoff. This not only heightened border tensions but also affected the broader **India-China relationship**, which has historically been marked by both cooperation and competition in economic, strategic, and geopolitical spheres.

### The Recent Agreement and Diplomatic Progress

Earlier this week, Indian and Chinese officials announced that they had reached an agreement to resolve the remaining friction points at the LAC, particularly in **Demchok** and **Depsang**. This agreement is seen as a major development in efforts to de-escalate tensions along the border. Both sides have now committed to initiating processes aimed at **disengagement of troops** and reducing military build-up in these sensitive areas.

In their bilateral meeting, Modi and Xi hailed this development as a pivotal step toward bringing relations back on a **normal path**. While specific details of the disengagement process have not been made public, officials from both nations have indicated that the agreement involves phased withdrawal of troops from forward positions, a move aimed at **confidence-building** between the two nuclear-armed neighbors.

### Moving Towards Normalcy in India-China Relations

The bilateral meeting between Modi and Xi marked the highest level of dialogue between the two leaders since the 2020 border clash. Their discussion focused on restoring bilateral ties that have been strained by the standoff. Both leaders emphasized the need for peace and stability at the border, recognizing that the broader India-China relationship is contingent upon resolving the ongoing border disputes. Modi and Xi also agreed to maintain diplomatic and military channels of communication to prevent further incidents and manage any future differences constructively.

For India, resolving the LAC issue is crucial not only for security but also for maintaining economic stability, as China is one of its largest trading partners. Similarly, China sees stable relations with India as important, especially as both countries are rising powers in Asia with significant influence on global geopolitical dynamics.

### Broader Implications

The resolution of the military stand-off at the LAC and the return to high-level bilateral dialogue have far-reaching implications for regional and global stability. The **India-China** relationship is one of the most complex and consequential in the world, involving not only border issues but also cooperation in global forums like **BRICS**, the **Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)**, and the **United Nations**. The agreement to de-escalate tensions at the border could pave the way for more constructive collaboration between the two nations on global challenges like climate change, trade, and regional security.

### Conclusion

The first formal bilateral meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping in five years signals a crucial turning point in India-China relations. With the military stand-off at the LAC on a path to resolution, both nations have taken a significant step towards normalizing relations, emphasizing peace and stability. While challenges remain, the agreement to disengage troops and reduce tensions reflects a mutual commitment to avoiding conflict and fostering cooperation, thereby laying the foundation for a more stable and constructive relationship in the future.

# Growth prescription

The **latest World Economic Outlook (WEO)** report released by the **International Monetary Fund (IMF)** offers a mixed global economic forecast, with some positive developments alongside serious concerns. On the bright side, a global recession, which many had feared, has been successfully averted. Moreover, inflation, which had been rising sharply in recent years, is largely under control in many parts of the world, with the IMF suggesting that the war against inflation is “almost won.” Additionally, global growth remains steady, providing relief to economies that had braced for a more severe downturn.

### Short-Term Optimism

One of the most significant positive developments in the WEO report pertains to the **U.S. economy**, which is expected to grow faster in 2023 than previously forecast. The U.S., the world’s largest economy, has shown resilience, with strong consumer spending and employment data contributing to higher-than-expected growth. This strong U.S. performance is helping to offset slower growth rates in some major **European economies**, which are struggling with weaker demand and higher energy prices. The IMF has lowered growth forecasts for several large European nations, citing persistent challenges such as inflation and weak industrial output.

While global growth is forecast to remain steady at **3.2% in 2024**, the same rate as in 2023, the dynamics of growth are uneven across different regions. The IMF report highlights that growth prospects are not uniformly positive, with developing regions facing challenges, particularly in **West Asia, sub-Saharan Africa**, and **Central Asia**.

### Challenges for Developing Nations

Among developing economies, the outlook is less optimistic in certain regions. The IMF has downgraded its growth projections for **West Asia, sub-Saharan Africa**, and **Central Asia**. These regions are facing economic setbacks due to **conflicts, political instability, and disruptions in production and shipping**. In West Asia, ongoing geopolitical tensions and conflicts have impacted oil production and trade routes, creating uncertainty for economic growth. Similarly, in sub-Saharan Africa, conflicts in countries such as Sudan and Niger have disrupted local economies, compounding the difficulties already posed by inflation and debt vulnerabilities.

Moreover, in Central Asia, unrest and sanctions linked to regional conflicts have strained economic stability, affecting trade and investment flows. These regions are now projected to experience lower growth rates than previously expected, which could worsen socio-economic challenges such as unemployment and poverty.

### Brighter Prospects for Emerging Asia

On the other hand, the outlook for **emerging Asia**, particularly **China** and **India**, is significantly more positive. In this region, growth prospects have been buoyed by higher public investments, particularly in infrastructure projects and development initiatives. China, which had been experiencing a slowdown in the wake of the pandemic and real estate sector issues, is showing signs of recovery thanks to increased government spending and fiscal stimulus.

**India**, too, is benefitting from higher public investment and an uptick in manufacturing and services. The IMF acknowledges that **India’s robust economic growth**, driven by domestic demand, technological advancements, and government reforms, is contributing to the overall stability of emerging Asian economies. Together, China and India’s positive outlooks are expected to offset some of the downward pressures from other regions, helping to sustain global growth at a steady pace.

### Outlook for 2024

Overall, the IMF’s WEO report presents a cautiously optimistic outlook for the global economy in 2024. Global growth is expected to remain at **3.2%**, the same level as in 2023. While the threat of recession has diminished, and inflation is being brought under control, economic recovery is uneven across different regions. Stronger growth in the U.S., China, and India is balancing out weaker prospects in Europe, West Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and Central Asia.

### Conclusion

The IMF’s latest World Economic Outlook reflects both optimism and challenges. While the global economy has avoided a recession and inflation is tapering, the world still faces regional disparities in growth. Developed economies like the U.S. show resilience, but several developing regions, impacted by conflict and unrest, face slower growth. However, brighter prospects in **emerging Asia**, driven by public investment in China and India, offer hope for steady global growth in 2024. The key challenge moving forward will be addressing regional conflicts and ensuring inclusive, balanced economic growth worldwide.

> The **IMF's World Economic Outlook** offers a mixed forecast for 2024, noting that a global recession has been averted and inflation is largely under control. The **U.S. economy** is expected to grow faster than anticipated, while growth forecasts for **Europe** and developing regions like **West Asia**, **sub-Saharan Africa**, and **Central Asia** have been downgraded due to conflicts and disruptions. However, stronger growth prospects in **emerging Asia**, particularly **China** and **India**, driven by higher public investments, are balancing global performance. The IMF projects steady global growth at **3.2%** for 2024, the same as in 2023, with regional disparities remaining a concern.
