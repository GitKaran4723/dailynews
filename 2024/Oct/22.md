# Secularism is a core part of the Constitution: SC

On Monday, the Supreme Court of India reaffirmed that secularism is a fundamental and indelible part of the **Basic Structure of the Constitution**. The observation was made by a Bench comprising Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Sanjay Kumar while hearing a series of petitions, including one filed by former Rajya Sabha member Subramanian Swamy. These petitions challenge the inclusion of the words "socialist" and "secular" in the Preamble to the Constitution, questioning their place in India’s foundational document.

### The Case and Context
The petitioners, including Subramanian Swamy, argued that the words "socialist" and "secular" were not originally part of the Constitution when it was adopted in 1950. These terms were added later by the **42nd Amendment** in 1976 during the Emergency period. They contended that these additions altered the original vision of the Constitution and should be reconsidered. Their argument suggests that these terms impose specific ideologies that may not reflect the full diversity of thought present within the Indian populace.

However, the Supreme Court has consistently upheld the idea that secularism is an inherent feature of the Constitution, even before the 42nd Amendment. The inclusion of the term in the Preamble only formalized what was already implied by the principles of equality, liberty, and fraternity outlined in the document. The Court has repeatedly stated that secularism is a vital part of the Constitution's **Basic Structure** — a doctrine that prevents the Parliament from amending certain fundamental aspects of the Constitution.

### What is the Basic Structure Doctrine?
The **Basic Structure Doctrine** is a judicial principle established by the Supreme Court in the landmark **Kesavananda Bharati case** of 1973. It holds that while the Constitution can be amended by Parliament, there are certain core principles — the “basic structure” — that cannot be altered or destroyed, even by constitutional amendments. Among these core principles are the rule of law, separation of powers, fundamental rights, and secularism.

The Supreme Court’s stance on secularism as part of the Basic Structure means that any attempt to remove or dilute this principle, whether through legislative action or constitutional amendments, would likely be struck down as unconstitutional.

### Secularism and the Indian Constitution
Secularism in India means that the state maintains an equal distance from all religions and treats all citizens, regardless of their faith, equally under the law. It ensures that the government does not favor any religion and that religious identity is not a basis for discrimination. The Constitution guarantees this principle through provisions such as **Article 25**, which ensures the right to freedom of religion, and **Article 14**, which guarantees equality before the law.

The Supreme Court, in its observation, pointed to the principles of **equality** and **fraternity** mentioned in the Constitution. These terms, the Bench noted, clearly imply secularism, as they promote a society where every individual, irrespective of religion, is treated equally. The Court also referred to its past judgments, emphasizing that secularism has always been regarded as an integral part of the constitutional framework.

### The 42nd Amendment and Its Impact
The 42nd Amendment, passed during the Emergency in 1976, added the words "secular" and "socialist" to the Preamble. Critics of the amendment argue that it was introduced during a period when civil liberties were suspended, and thus it did not reflect the will of the people. However, the amendment's supporters contend that it merely formalized the principles that were already inherent in the Constitution.

By adding these terms, the Preamble explicitly stated India's commitment to secularism, ensuring that the country remains a pluralistic society where all religions are respected. This is particularly important in a diverse nation like India, where multiple religions coexist, and maintaining harmony and equality among them is crucial for national unity.

### Conclusion
The Supreme Court's recent reaffirmation that secularism is an integral part of the Basic Structure of the Constitution underscores its central role in Indian democracy. By making this observation, the Court has indicated that any attempt to challenge or undermine secularism would likely be met with strong judicial resistance. The principle of secularism, deeply embedded in India's constitutional framework, ensures equality, liberty, and fraternity for all citizens, irrespective of their religion. 

The ongoing debate over the inclusion of "secular" and "socialist" in the Preamble may continue in legal and political forums, but the judiciary’s stance remains clear: secularism is, and always has been, a core feature of the Indian Constitution.

# Cyclone Dana likely to cross West Bengal, Odisha coasts

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) announced on Monday that a well-marked low-pressure area over the Bay of Bengal is expected to intensify into a severe cyclonic storm. The system is forecasted to cross the north Odisha and West Bengal coasts between Puri in Odisha and Sagar Island in West Bengal, during the night of Thursday and the early hours of Friday. This development raises concerns for the eastern coast of India, where such storms have historically caused significant damage to life, property, and infrastructure.

### Formation and Expected Path of the Cyclone
The IMD explained that the low-pressure area, which originated over the southeast Bay of Bengal, has intensified due to favorable meteorological conditions, including high sea surface temperatures and conducive wind patterns. The cyclone is likely to gather strength over the next few days as it moves in a north-northwesterly direction toward the eastern coast of India.

Based on current projections, the cyclone is expected to make landfall between **Puri** and **Sagar Island**, which covers a wide stretch of the Odisha and West Bengal coastline. The IMD forecasts that the storm will likely be at its most intense when it hits the land, categorized as a "severe cyclonic storm" with wind speeds between 90 and 100 km/h, and potentially higher in gusts.

### Implications for Odisha and West Bengal
Both Odisha and West Bengal have extensive coastlines that are vulnerable to cyclones originating from the Bay of Bengal. The expected landfall near the coastal regions will likely bring heavy rainfall, high winds, and storm surges that could lead to widespread damage.

#### Impact on Odisha
Odisha has faced numerous cyclones in the past, such as Cyclone Fani in 2019, which caused extensive destruction. The coastal districts of the state, including **Puri, Balasore, and Bhadrak**, are expected to experience the brunt of the storm. Heavy rainfall could lead to flooding, especially in low-lying areas, and high-speed winds may cause damage to homes, power lines, and infrastructure. The state government, in coordination with the IMD, is expected to issue warnings and take precautionary measures, including the potential evacuation of people from vulnerable areas.

#### Impact on West Bengal
In West Bengal, districts such as **South 24 Parganas, East Midnapore, and Kolkata** may experience the cyclone's impact. The low-lying areas of the Sunderbans, particularly vulnerable to storm surges, could face significant flooding. Fishermen have been advised not to venture into the sea, and the state administration is expected to prepare for potential evacuations in these districts.

The IMD has also warned that the cyclone could disrupt air and rail traffic in the affected regions and damage crops, particularly paddy fields, as this period coincides with the harvesting season in many areas. The storm could also affect large populations in urban centers like Bhubaneswar, Cuttack, and Kolkata due to the possibility of waterlogging and power outages.

### Precautionary Measures
The IMD and state disaster management authorities in Odisha and West Bengal are on high alert. Warnings have been issued to fishermen, and authorities are likely to initiate evacuation plans for those residing in low-lying areas near the coast. Relief materials, rescue teams, and temporary shelters are being readied in preparation for the storm's landfall.

The **National Disaster Response Force (NDRF)** and state disaster response teams are expected to be deployed in the coastal areas, and emergency services will be on standby to respond to any disruptions caused by the storm. Authorities will also focus on minimizing the impact on vulnerable populations, including fishermen, coastal communities, and farmers, whose livelihoods are at risk.

### Conclusion
The impending cyclonic storm over the Bay of Bengal presents a significant challenge for the eastern coast of India, particularly Odisha and West Bengal. With landfall expected between Puri and Sagar Island, both states are preparing for heavy rainfall, strong winds, and potential storm surges. The IMD continues to monitor the storm’s development closely, and timely updates and warnings will be issued to ensure that the population is adequately prepared to face the cyclone and its aftermath. Efforts by disaster management agencies to minimize the loss of life and property are crucial in the coming days.

### What is a Cyclone?

A **cyclone** is a large-scale air mass that rotates around a strong center of low atmospheric pressure. Cyclones are characterized by inward-spiraling winds and, depending on their location and strength, they are referred to by different names. In the **North Atlantic and Northeast Pacific**, they are called **hurricanes**, in the **Northwest Pacific**, they are called **typhoons**, and in the **South Pacific and Indian Ocean**, they are called **cyclones**. Cyclones are classified based on their intensity, and in the Indian subcontinent, they generally range from low-pressure systems to severe cyclonic storms.

### Formation of a Cyclone

Cyclones are formed over warm ocean waters near the equator. The essential factors required for the formation of a cyclone include:

1. **Warm Ocean Waters**: The sea surface temperature must be at least 26°C to fuel the cyclone. Warm water evaporates and creates a large amount of moist air that rises and forms clouds.
   
2. **Low-Pressure Area**: A region of low atmospheric pressure forms when warm, moist air rises from the ocean surface, creating a vacuum. This low-pressure area becomes the center of the cyclone.

3. **Coriolis Effect**: Due to the Earth's rotation, winds spiral into the low-pressure center. This rotation is called the Coriolis effect, causing cyclones to spin counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere.

4. **Converging Winds**: Winds from the surrounding high-pressure areas move toward the low-pressure center, bringing more moisture-laden air into the system.

5. **Outflow**: As the moist air rises, it cools and condenses, releasing latent heat, which fuels further upward movement. This process allows the storm to grow. At the top of the cyclone, air flows outward, which helps maintain the low pressure at the center.

### Stages of Cyclone Development

1. **Tropical Disturbance**: It starts as a collection of thunderstorms over warm tropical waters. This stage involves a minor disturbance in atmospheric conditions, with winds less than 20 km/h.

2. **Tropical Depression**: As the system becomes more organized, the low-pressure area deepens, and winds increase to between 30-60 km/h.

3. **Tropical Storm**: The system develops a more defined structure, with a clear rotation. Winds increase to 63-118 km/h, and the system is now strong enough to be named by the meteorological authorities.

4. **Cyclonic Storm**: The system intensifies further, with wind speeds of over 119 km/h. At this stage, the storm becomes a severe weather event with potential to cause widespread damage, particularly near coastal areas.

5. **Severe Cyclonic Storm**: If the winds continue to strengthen, the cyclone is classified as a severe cyclonic storm, with wind speeds exceeding 150 km/h. 

### Structure of a Cyclone

1. **Eye**: The center of the cyclone is known as the **eye**. It is typically 20-40 km in diameter and is characterized by calm weather and clear skies, surrounded by the eyewall, where the most severe weather occurs.

2. **Eyewall**: Surrounding the eye, this is the most intense part of the cyclone, with the strongest winds and heaviest rains. The winds in the eyewall cause the most damage during landfall.

3. **Rainbands**: These are spiraling bands of clouds and thunderstorms extending outward from the eyewall. Rainbands can stretch hundreds of kilometers and cause heavy rainfall, strong winds, and localized flooding.

### Cyclone Categories in the Indian Context

In the Indian Ocean, cyclones are categorized based on wind speeds:
- **Depression**: Winds up to 31-50 km/h
- **Deep Depression**: Winds of 51-61 km/h
- **Cyclonic Storm**: Winds of 62-88 km/h
- **Severe Cyclonic Storm**: Winds of 89-117 km/h
- **Very Severe Cyclonic Storm**: Winds of 118-165 km/h
- **Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm**: Winds of 166-220 km/h
- **Super Cyclonic Storm**: Winds exceeding 221 km/h

### Effects of Cyclones

1. **Heavy Rainfall**: Cyclones bring torrential rains, leading to flash floods in both coastal and inland regions.

2. **Storm Surge**: The cyclone’s low-pressure system and strong winds can raise sea levels, causing coastal flooding when the storm makes landfall. This is called a **storm surge**, and it can be the most deadly effect of a cyclone, inundating low-lying coastal areas with seawater.

3. **Strong Winds**: Cyclones produce intense winds that can uproot trees, damage buildings, and disrupt power lines. These winds are particularly destructive in the eyewall region.

4. **Inland Flooding**: Even after the cyclone dissipates, the heavy rains can lead to rivers overflowing their banks, causing extensive flooding far from the coast.

5. **Landslides**: In hilly areas, the heavy rainfall associated with cyclones can trigger landslides, leading to loss of life and damage to infrastructure.

### Cyclone Preparedness and Response

1. **Early Warnings**: Meteorological departments, like the **India Meteorological Department (IMD)**, use satellites, radars, and weather models to monitor and predict cyclones. They issue warnings to help local authorities and communities prepare for the storm.

2. **Evacuation Plans**: Coastal states have established **evacuation protocols** to move people from vulnerable areas to safer shelters. This is crucial to minimize casualties from storm surges and flooding.

3. **Shelters**: Cyclone shelters are built in coastal regions, designed to withstand high winds and floods, providing temporary refuge for those evacuated from danger zones.

4. **Disaster Response**: **National Disaster Response Force (NDRF)** teams are deployed in areas expected to be affected by cyclones. These teams assist with evacuation, rescue, and post-cyclone relief efforts.

5. **Post-Cyclone Recovery**: After the cyclone passes, efforts focus on restoring power, communication, and transportation infrastructure, providing food and medical aid, and repairing homes and public services.

### Conclusion

Cyclones are powerful and destructive weather systems that can cause immense damage to life and property. Understanding their formation, structure, and the way they are classified helps in preparing for their impacts. Through early warnings, effective evacuation strategies, and robust disaster management, the loss of life and damage can be minimized. Given India's vulnerability to cyclones, particularly along its eastern coast, preparedness and resilience-building measures are crucial to protect both people and ecosystems from the severe consequences of these natural events.

# India, China reach deal on easing LAC tensions

India and China have reached a significant breakthrough regarding the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the de facto border between the two nations. On Monday, the Union government announced that both countries had agreed on "patrolling arrangements" and measures aimed at resolving the longstanding military stand-off at various points along the LAC. This resolution, coming after numerous rounds of diplomatic and military talks, is seen as a positive development in addressing the strained relations between the two nuclear-armed neighbors.

### Background of the LAC Tensions
The tensions between India and China along the LAC escalated significantly in 2020, with violent skirmishes occurring in the Galwan Valley. This resulted in casualties on both sides and was the most severe military confrontation between the two nations since the 1962 Sino-Indian War. Over the years, both countries have disagreed on the exact demarcation of the LAC, leading to frequent face-offs between their armies, as both sides patrol areas they claim to be part of their respective territories.

The two regions that have remained points of contention are **Demchok** and **Depsang**, both located in eastern Ladakh. These areas, particularly important from a strategic military perspective, have been the focus of multiple rounds of military and diplomatic negotiations. The resolution of these friction points is a key aspect of the recent agreement.

### Key Points of the Agreement
The "patrolling arrangements" mentioned in the agreement are crucial, as they will govern the movement of troops in sensitive areas along the LAC. These arrangements are intended to prevent any unintentional escalations between the two sides by establishing clear protocols for how patrols are conducted. The goal is to maintain peace and stability while both sides negotiate a more permanent solution to the border issue.

Officials have noted that the resolution covers the **remaining friction points** of Demchok and Depsang. These areas have witnessed prolonged military build-up by both India and China, with troops stationed in close proximity. By agreeing to a framework on patrolling, both countries aim to reduce the risk of further conflict and de-escalate the situation.

In addition to military stand-offs, the agreement likely touches on the disengagement of forces from forward positions. Both nations have, over the past few years, undertaken partial disengagement in some sectors but have found it challenging to resolve the more contentious areas, particularly in Depsang and Demchok. The new framework is expected to pave the way for a phased and coordinated withdrawal of troops, ensuring that neither side feels disadvantaged.

### Diplomatic Efforts
This agreement is the result of persistent diplomatic and military talks. India and China have held multiple rounds of military commander-level talks, as well as diplomatic consultations, to resolve the deadlock. The two nations have also engaged in broader discussions under the framework of special representatives on the boundary question, which has served as a platform for addressing border issues since 2003.

In recent months, diplomatic efforts have been intensified, with both sides showing a willingness to reach a compromise. The resolution of the stand-off is seen as a diplomatic victory for both nations, as it allows them to avoid further escalation and focus on larger economic and geopolitical concerns.

### Future Implications
The agreement on patrolling arrangements and the resolution of the military stand-off at Demchok and Depsang could lead to a broader rapprochement between India and China. While the resolution of these two friction points is a positive step, it is unlikely to fully resolve the border dispute. The LAC remains undefined in many sectors, and both nations have competing territorial claims that are yet to be addressed.

However, the agreement reduces the immediate risk of conflict and opens the door for further negotiations. If successful, it could lead to a more lasting resolution of the LAC issue, potentially improving India-China relations. Moreover, it allows both nations to focus on other pressing issues, such as economic cooperation and global challenges like climate change and regional security.

### Conclusion
The recent agreement between India and China on patrolling arrangements and the resolution of the military stand-off at the LAC is a significant development in the context of bilateral relations. It addresses the critical friction points of Demchok and Depsang, reducing the likelihood of further conflict. While many challenges remain, this breakthrough marks a step towards greater stability and cooperation between the two Asian giants.

> India and China have reached an agreement on patrolling arrangements to resolve the military stand-off along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), particularly addressing the friction points at Demchok and Depsang. This breakthrough follows years of diplomatic and military negotiations after tensions escalated in 2020. The agreement includes measures to prevent future confrontations, such as protocols for troop movements and disengagement from sensitive areas. While it reduces immediate risks of conflict, the broader LAC issue remains unresolved. However, this development marks a positive step towards stabilizing relations and potentially improving cooperation between the two nations.

# An approaching milestone in constitutional governance

November 26 this year will mark the commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the adoption of the Constitution of India. It is a milestone that needs to be celebrated by every stakeholder of Indian democracy. Constitutional governance in India is not merely a facet of the laws, rules and regulations that govern the establishment and the evolution of democratic institutions. It is also about permeating a deep sense of constitutional culture that has captured the collective consciousness of Indians across different cultures, faiths and beliefs.

### Respect for institutions, power transition

As we move towards celebrating this Constitution Day, it is an opportune time to identify the core constitutional values that have shaped the constitutional culture of India. These five values have also withstood the test of time.

First, people’s respect for democratic institutions. The Constitution of India was adopted on November 26, 1949, a time when life expectancy in India was around 32 years. Today, it has progressed to around 70 years. This extraordinary improvement in the standards of living and the quality of life has contributed in a significant manner for the ordinary Indian to respect the role and the contribution of democratic institutions. The social and economic development of India is an example of the progressive implementation of public policy over the last several decades. There is a need for a nuanced understanding on why Indians continue to participate in such large and significant numbers in every election — local, State or national — notwithstanding the fact that they expect a better performance from their representatives. Since the first elections in 1951-52, we have consistently witnessed nearly 60% of Indians participating in elections including in the 2024 general election where there was a a 65.79% voter turnout. The respect for democracy and faith in democratic institutions in India is a core constitutional value that has withstood the test of time.

Second, the smooth transition of elected governments. The seven decades have seen numerous elections across States and at the national level. India has seen elected representatives representing different political parties, with varying degrees of strength and presence, within a State and/or at a pan-India level. We have also seen political leaders of different ideological persuasions winning elections and holding positions of power and responsibility in the States and at the Centre. But if there is one thing that is unique and distinctive about India’s democratic traditions, it is the deep commitment every political party attaches to the idea of smooth transitions of power at the end of elections. While elections are fought with high-voltage campaigns and at times, even divisive narratives, the electoral results are almost always a humbling experience — it is the people of India who win each election without any exception. The Indian electorate has, time and again, demonstrated to the world that its understanding of problems and challenges will shape our decisions relating to elections. The people of India have imbibed this core constitutional value of participating in elections and enabling the smooth transition of power from one government to the other.

### Upholding rights

Third, protection of rights and freedoms through courts. The Constitution is very forthright in recognising the highest degree of importance being attached to the fundamental rights and the courts, which are institutions created under the Constitution to protect the rights of people. It is even more remarkable that the framers of the Constitution were people associated with the freedom movement and responsible for building the foundations of the Indian Republic. They struggled to fight against colonialism to help achieve India’s freedom. While drafting the provisions relating to fundamental rights, the members of the Constituent Assembly were mindful of the power of the mighty state and its instrumentalities. They could have tilted towards the idea of a benevolent state, especially when almost the entire first Cabinet had people who were part of the freedom movement. However, their deep scepticism of the state apparatus and the fervent commitment towards protecting individual rights and freedoms reflected a far-sighted vision on their part. This vision of recognising the role of the state, while being conscious of the fact that rights and freedoms are paramount, is a core constitutional value that has only been strengthened over the years.

Fourth, federalism as a facet of constitutional governance. The framers of the Constitution were mindful of the extraordinary diversity of the country, including its linguistic diversity and other forms of pluralism deeply embedded in our civic and political culture. The history and the tradition of every State of India also meant that they were conscious of protecting the unique identity, tradition and culture of the States and the people while forging a collective national identity. They created different forms of autonomy and special privileges for different States keeping in mind their unique histories and cultures. To efficaciously ameliorate the disparities that are prevalent among the people in certain regions of the nation, the Indian Constitution delineates a paradigm of special dispensations, furthering the agenda of equity and inclusivity.

Over the last seven decades, the idea of federalism has further deepened at least at two levels: first, the rise of State-level political parties across India and their own contribution to the development of national political consciousness. This has, on several occasions, led to strong State parties contributing to the development of coalition governments in the States and at the Centre. Second, the idea of federalism has also led to the passing of the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments, which led to the establishment of panchayati raj institutions and nagarpalikas.

### The part played by media, civil society

Fifth, the role of the media and civil society in instilling faith in democracy. Much has been said and written about the Indian media. The Indian media is a diverse and heterogeneous institution with views and perspectives that are generated across India in different languages. Further, the transition of print media to broadcast and further innovations in media and technology have democratised access to information and indeed the role of media. While there are fundamental challenges relating to the economic model of governance of media institutions, it is fair to say that media and civil society have contributed to the instilling of faith in Indian democracy. While we need to be critical of the challenges of the autonomy and the independence of media, it is equally important to recognise the values of transparency that have been part of the media culture. In the cacophony of an information explosion through various forms of media and the medium of communication, the Indian electorate has been enlightened to develop an informed degree of understanding of the role of the media and civil society.

We have every reason to celebrate 75 years of constitutional governance.

After Independence, the last British commander in chief of the Indian Army, General Claude Auchinleck had observed, “The Sikhs may try to set up a separate regime. I think they probably will and that will be only a start of a general decentralization and break-up of the idea that India is a country, whereas it is a subcontinent as varied as Europe. The Punjabi is as different from a Madrassi as a Scot is from an Italian. The British tried to consolidate it but achieved nothing permanent. No one can make a nation out of a continent of many nations.”

We proved many people wrong in not only forging a national identity of a nation that is built on constitutional ideals but we have also made the Constitution an instrument of galvanising social conscience and political consciousness.

> C. Raj Kumar, Vice Chancellor of O.P. Jindal Global University, emphasizes the importance of celebrating the 75th anniversary of the adoption of the Indian Constitution on November 26. He highlights that constitutional governance in India goes beyond legal frameworks, encompassing a broader constitutional culture that has deeply influenced the country's diverse society. This milestone is significant for all stakeholders of Indian democracy, as it represents the collective consciousness of people from various cultural, religious, and belief systems. Kumar underscores the need to reflect on the Constitution's enduring impact on India's democratic institutions and societal values.

# The case for a nature restoration law in India

The degradation of natural ecosystems is a pressing global challenge, and India, known for its vast geographical and ecological diversity, is particularly vulnerable to this crisis. Approximately 30% of India’s total land area is already affected by land degradation, which poses significant threats to biodiversity, agricultural productivity, and the livelihoods of millions who depend on the land. Given this urgent situation, it is increasingly clear that India needs to adopt a comprehensive Nature Restoration Law (NRL), modeled after successful global initiatives like the one enacted by the European Union (EU).

### The Scope of India’s Environmental Challenges
India's environment is under stress due to a combination of factors, including deforestation, soil erosion, loss of biodiversity, industrial pollution, and unsustainable agricultural practices. The impact of climate change has further exacerbated these challenges, resulting in frequent extreme weather events like floods, droughts, and rising temperatures. These problems are not only threatening India's natural ecosystems but also the health, livelihoods, and well-being of its citizens.

Land degradation is particularly alarming in the context of India’s heavy reliance on agriculture. With over 58% of the population depending on agriculture for their livelihood, any further loss of productive land could have serious socio-economic consequences. Additionally, deforestation and habitat loss are endangering wildlife, while the degradation of rivers and water bodies is threatening water security. Thus, restoring and protecting natural ecosystems is not just an environmental issue but a critical economic and social priority for India.

### Learning from the EU’s Nature Restoration Law
In response to similar environmental challenges, the European Union introduced the Nature Restoration Law (NRL) in 2022. This law sets legally binding targets to restore degraded ecosystems across Europe by 2050. It requires member states to develop restoration plans that address ecosystems, habitats, and species in forests, grasslands, wetlands, and urban areas. The NRL aims to bring 20% of Europe’s degraded ecosystems into recovery by 2030 and ensure that natural processes like pollination, soil regeneration, and water purification are maintained.

India can learn several valuable lessons from the EU’s approach. Firstly, setting legally binding restoration targets would hold the government and various stakeholders accountable, ensuring that ecosystem recovery is not left to voluntary measures. Secondly, the NRL emphasizes ecosystem-wide restoration rather than focusing on specific species or isolated areas, recognizing that ecological health is interconnected and requires a holistic approach. A similar strategy in India could ensure that various ecosystems, from forests and wetlands to farmlands and urban areas, are restored comprehensively.

### The Need for a Nature Restoration Law in India
A dedicated Nature Restoration Law in India could address the country’s environmental degradation in a systematic and long-term manner. Such a law would require the government to set measurable goals for restoring degraded ecosystems, ensuring that restoration becomes a priority in policy and governance. It would also promote the integration of conservation efforts with economic and social development initiatives, making environmental restoration a key part of India’s sustainable development agenda.

Moreover, a Nature Restoration Law could mobilize public and private investment into ecosystem restoration projects, creating green jobs and supporting sustainable livelihoods. Restoring degraded land, for example, would improve agricultural productivity, enhance food security, and mitigate the impacts of climate change by capturing carbon dioxide and improving water retention.

The benefits of such a law would extend beyond environmental restoration. According to the World Economic Forum, nature restoration could globally generate economic returns of up to $10 trillion annually by 2030. In India, restoring degraded lands would enhance agricultural productivity, improve water security, and create millions of jobs, particularly in rural areas. The law could also help India meet its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Goal 15, which calls for the sustainable management of forests and combating desertification.

Restoring ecosystems can also mitigate the effects of climate change, which exacerbates land degradation. Degraded land loses its capacity to absorb carbon dioxide, further contributing to global warming. By restoring its ecosystems, India can enhance its carbon sinks and meet its commitments under the Paris Agreement.

### Conclusion
India’s environmental degradation crisis demands urgent and coordinated action, and adopting a comprehensive Nature Restoration Law could be a crucial step toward addressing this challenge. By drawing inspiration from the EU’s Nature Restoration Law, India can implement legally binding targets for restoring ecosystems, promoting biodiversity, and safeguarding the well-being of its citizens. Such a law would not only protect natural ecosystems but also ensure that India’s environmental recovery is intertwined with sustainable economic and social progress, securing a healthier and more resilient future for all.

> India faces severe environmental degradation, with 30% of its land affected, threatening biodiversity, agriculture, and livelihoods. To address this crisis, India could adopt a comprehensive Nature Restoration Law (NRL), inspired by the European Union's 2022 legislation. The EU's NRL sets legally binding targets to restore ecosystems by 2050, promoting holistic restoration across habitats. A similar law in India would ensure measurable goals for ecosystem recovery, integrate restoration with sustainable development, and attract investments in green projects. This would not only improve environmental health but also support agriculture, food security, and climate resilience, ensuring a sustainable future for India.
