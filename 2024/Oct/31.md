---

#### **American Influence on Work Culture**
1. **Dominance of U.S. Multinationals**:
   - Most multinationals (MNCs) have U.S. origins, bringing a work culture centered around **long hours** and **stringent targets**.
   - This approach gained prominence post-Cold War, as U.S. norms became global benchmarks.
2. **Protestant Ethic**:
   - Sociologist **Max Weber** linked the glorification of work to Protestant beliefs, which shaped American capitalism.
   - Work culture in MNCs reflects this ideology, emphasizing relentless effort over ergonomics or organizational well-being.

---

#### **Economic Assessment**
1. **Productivity vs. Hours Worked**:
   - **GNP per capita (2023)**: The U.S. ranks 12th globally, behind countries like **Norway, Ireland, and Switzerland**, many of which work fewer hours annually.
   - Despite hard work, U.S. productivity growth over the past 50 years has been slower than most European countries.
2. **Implication**:
   - Wealthier countries demonstrate that **less working hours** can coexist with high productivity, highlighting the difference between productive work and excessive labor.

---

#### **India’s Adoption of Toxic Work Practices**
1. **Post-1991 Liberalization**:
   - Foreign investment brought capital and global practices, including long work hours and profit-driven labor policies.
   - MNCs have benefited significantly in India, securing lucrative government contracts and thriving financially.
2. **Impact on Indian Companies**:
   - Indian firms catering to offshore entities also adopted these practices, leading to stress-related health issues and suicides among employees.

---

#### **Recommendations**
1. **Government Regulation**:
   - **Work Hours**: Mandate adherence to Indian labor norms for MNCs and Indian firms serving global clients.
   - **Stress Management**: Enforce measures to prevent overwork and ensure mental well-being.
2. **Promote Local Expertise**:
   - Reduce reliance on international consulting firms, emphasizing the value of domestic expertise.

---

#### **Conclusion**
The incident in Pune underscores the need to scrutinize and regulate work practices in MNCs and offshore-focused Indian firms. While global integration is essential, it must not come at the cost of worker well-being. Stronger government oversight is critical to align workplace practices with national norms and ensure employee health and safety.

> India's adoption of toxic work practices from multinational corporations (MNCs) is under scrutiny after the reported overwork-related death of a young employee in Pune. Rooted in American work culture, marked by long hours and relentless targets, such practices gained prominence in India post-1991 liberalization. Despite global integration, data shows wealthier nations achieve higher productivity with fewer working hours. The government must regulate work hours in MNCs and offshore-focused Indian firms, ensuring adherence to labor norms and employee well-being. Emphasizing local expertise over international consultants could further mitigate these challenges and promote a healthier, more sustainable work culture in India.
