# A case of nothing but patent censorship

**Bombay High Court Strikes Down Amendment to IT Rules, Defending Free Speech**

On September 20, 2024, Justice A.S. Chandurkar of the Bombay High Court delivered a significant judgment in defense of the right to free speech, declaring an amendment to the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 (IT Rules) unconstitutional. The provision in question, Rule 3(1)(b)(v), imposed an onerous obligation on intermediaries—such as social media platforms, search engines, and internet service providers—to restrict the dissemination of information deemed false, fake, or misleading by the government’s Fact Check Unit (FCU). The judgment came after a tie-breaking decision, following a previous split verdict, and marked a critical moment in the ongoing debate about the balance between free speech and government regulation in the digital age.

### Background of the Amendment

The IT Rules, 2021, were introduced with the objective of regulating digital content and ensuring accountability on the part of intermediaries and digital platforms. The government has argued that these rules are necessary to curb misinformation, particularly in an era of rapid online dissemination of news and opinions. However, critics of the rules have raised concerns about potential overreach and the chilling effect on free speech.

The contested provision, Rule 3(1)(b)(v), required intermediaries to make "reasonable efforts" not to host or publish any information deemed by the Union government’s Fact Check Unit as false, fake, or misleading. If intermediaries failed to comply with the FCU’s directives, they risked losing their "safe harbour" protections under the Information Technology (IT) Act, 2000. Safe harbour is a critical legal immunity that protects intermediaries from being held liable for the content posted by users on their platforms. Without this protection, platforms could face legal consequences for third-party content, which could lead to over-censorship and a stifling of free expression.

### The Court’s Ruling

Justice A.S. Chandurkar, in his ruling, declared the provision unconstitutional, emphasizing that the law would have allowed the government unchecked power to control how news about its operations is disseminated on the internet. The court recognized that intermediaries play a vital role in facilitating free speech and expression in the digital realm, and imposing such a broad obligation on them would lead to excessive censorship.

The judgment was critical of the idea that a government-established Fact Check Unit could be the sole arbiter of what constitutes fake or misleading information about its own operations. Justice Chandurkar warned that such unchecked power would give the government “an Orwellian carte blanche,” allowing it to suppress dissenting opinions or critical reporting under the guise of combating misinformation. The ruling highlighted the need for robust safeguards to prevent abuse of regulatory powers, particularly when it comes to freedom of the press and the public’s right to access information.

### Impact on Free Speech

The decision by the Bombay High Court is a significant victory for free speech advocates, who have long argued that the IT Rules, in their current form, could be used to silence legitimate criticism of the government. By striking down the provision, the court has ensured that intermediaries, which serve as critical gateways to information in the digital age, are not forced into becoming de facto censors.

The ruling also safeguards the principle of safe harbour, which is integral to the functioning of the internet ecosystem. Without this protection, intermediaries would be overly cautious, potentially removing vast amounts of legitimate content in order to avoid legal liability. This could have led to an erosion of the public’s ability to freely express opinions and access information online.

### The Broader Legal Context

The court’s judgment fits into a larger pattern of judicial interventions aimed at curbing governmental overreach in the regulation of online speech. In recent years, Indian courts have increasingly recognized the challenges posed by government attempts to regulate online platforms. While there is a legitimate need to address the spread of fake news and misinformation, courts have often stressed that such efforts must be balanced with the protection of fundamental rights, including the right to free expression.

### Conclusion

The Bombay High Court’s ruling on the constitutionality of Rule 3(1)(b)(v) of the IT Rules is a landmark judgment that reinforces the importance of free speech in the digital age. By declaring the provision unconstitutional, Justice A.S. Chandurkar has prevented the government from gaining excessive control over how information about its operations is shared online. The ruling underscores the need for a careful balance between regulating harmful content and protecting fundamental rights, and it affirms the critical role of intermediaries in upholding free expression on the internet.

> On September 20, 2024, the Bombay High Court, led by Justice A.S. Chandurkar, ruled a provision of the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, unconstitutional. The provision required intermediaries to restrict content identified as false by the government's Fact Check Unit, risking their "safe harbour" immunity if they did not comply. The court found the rule gave the government excessive control over online speech, potentially leading to censorship. This judgment is a major victory for free speech advocates, ensuring intermediaries are not forced to act as censors while upholding freedom of expression online.

# Court of Conscience: Detailed Explanation with Example

### **Court of Conscience: Detailed Explanation with Example**

The **Court of Conscience** is a philosophical and ethical concept referring to the internal moral sense that guides a person’s decisions and actions. It is the inner tribunal or "moral compass" that judges an individual's actions, irrespective of external laws, authority, or judicial systems. Unlike formal courts, which rely on written laws and statutes to judge legality, the Court of Conscience is concerned with the **rightness** or **wrongness** of actions based on one's personal principles, values, and sense of justice.

In essence, the Court of Conscience operates on the basis of personal morality, ethical introspection, and individual responsibility. When a person is faced with a moral dilemma, their conscience weighs the consequences of their actions, seeking to align them with the broader ideals of fairness, honesty, and integrity.

### **Key Features of the Court of Conscience**

1. **Internal Judgment**: This court resides within the individual. It is self-regulated, and its judgments are based on one’s values, ethical beliefs, and sense of justice.
   
2. **Beyond Legal Boundaries**: The Court of Conscience often operates beyond the scope of law. What might be legally permissible could still be considered morally wrong by an individual’s conscience.

3. **Universal Moral Values**: While legal systems differ across societies, the Court of Conscience often draws upon universal moral values such as fairness, truth, compassion, and justice.

4. **Guilt and Accountability**: The Court of Conscience holds individuals accountable for their moral actions. Even if no one else is aware of a person’s actions, their conscience can instill a sense of guilt or satisfaction based on whether they acted ethically or unethically.

5. **Personal Responsibility**: The judgments rendered by this court are personal. An individual cannot "escape" the judgments of their own conscience, as it operates continuously within one's mind and character.

### **Example of the Court of Conscience in Action**

Imagine a government official who has access to insider information about a land development project. Legally, the official is in a position to use this information to make personal financial gains, perhaps by buying land in the area before it increases in value due to the development. There is no law preventing the official from doing so, and from a legal standpoint, they may not be committing a crime.

However, the official's **Court of Conscience** might tell them that using this information for personal gain is ethically wrong. They might feel that their position of power and the trust placed in them requires them to act in the public interest, not for personal benefit. Even though the law doesn't prohibit their actions, the official might decide not to exploit the situation based on their personal moral values, which tell them that it is an abuse of power and unfair to the general public.

In this case, the **Court of Conscience** renders a judgment against the official’s potential action, guiding them to behave ethically, even though the legal system has not intervened.

### **Real-Life Example: Mahatma Gandhi and the Court of Conscience**

Mahatma Gandhi is an exemplary figure whose actions were often guided by his **Court of Conscience**. One notable instance was when he advocated for nonviolent resistance against British rule in India. British laws were legal at the time, and many viewed the Indian independence movement as rebellion. However, Gandhi's conscience judged British rule as unjust and oppressive. His **internal sense of right and wrong** guided him to stand against colonialism through peaceful protests, regardless of the legal consequences or how others viewed the law.

Gandhi believed in **Satyagraha**, which means “truth-force” or “soul-force,” acting according to one's conscience and moral principles even when it contradicts legal authority. He argued that unjust laws should be resisted if they violate human rights and ethical values. Gandhi's actions were shaped by his **Court of Conscience**, which believed in fairness, equality, and nonviolence, transcending the external legal systems imposed by the British government.

### **Court of Conscience vs. Legal Courts**

- **Legal Courts**: Governed by statutory laws and regulations. Their judgments are based on formal procedures, and the decisions are legally binding. Legal courts may enforce penalties, fines, or imprisonment based on legal violations.
  
- **Court of Conscience**: Based on individual morality and ethical principles. There are no formal proceedings, but the individual may feel internal guilt, shame, or satisfaction based on their conscience’s judgment. The consequences of violating one’s conscience are internal, often manifesting as personal guilt, self-condemnation, or mental conflict.

### **Examples of Conscience Dilemmas**

1. **Whistleblowing**: A person working in a large corporation discovers illegal practices, such as embezzling funds or polluting the environment. Legally, the person might fear retaliation if they come forward, but their conscience may urge them to expose the wrongdoing to protect the public interest, despite the personal risk.

2. **Helping Someone in Need**: You see someone in dire need of help, but no law requires you to intervene. Your conscience, however, might push you to assist the person, based on the moral belief that you should help others, even though legally, you're not obligated to do so.

### **Conclusion**

The **Court of Conscience** is a vital aspect of ethical decision-making that transcends legal frameworks. It represents the inner tribunal where individuals judge their actions based on moral values, principles, and personal integrity. This internal court can often guide people to make the right choices, even when external systems of law or authority may permit unethical behavior. By fostering a strong Court of Conscience, individuals can align their actions with broader ethical ideals and contribute to a more just and humane society.

> The **Court of Conscience** refers to an individual's internal moral compass that guides their actions based on personal principles, irrespective of legal or external authority. It focuses on ethical rightness rather than legality. This court encourages individuals to make decisions aligned with universal values like fairness, honesty, and justice, even if their actions are legally permissible. For example, a person may follow their conscience to avoid unethical actions, such as exploiting insider information, despite no legal consequences. Unlike legal courts, which impose external penalties, the Court of Conscience leads to internal consequences, like guilt or satisfaction, based on moral judgment.

# Fungi: Detailed Explanation

### **Fungi: Detailed Explanation**

Fungi are a kingdom of living organisms that are distinct from plants, animals, and bacteria. They are a diverse group that includes organisms such as **mushrooms**, **yeasts**, **molds**, and **lichen**. Fungi play essential roles in ecosystems as decomposers, pathogens, and symbiotic partners. Despite their often inconspicuous nature, fungi are crucial for the balance of ecosystems, human industry, and medicine.

### **Key Characteristics of Fungi**

1. **Eukaryotic Cells**: Fungi are made of **eukaryotic cells**, meaning their cells have a true nucleus enclosed within membranes, similar to plant and animal cells.

2. **Cell Wall Composition**: Unlike plants, which have **cellulose** in their cell walls, fungi have **chitin**, a strong, fibrous substance also found in the exoskeletons of insects.

3. **Heterotrophic Nutrition**: Fungi are **heterotrophic** organisms, meaning they cannot make their own food through photosynthesis (like plants). Instead, they absorb nutrients from their environment by secreting enzymes that break down complex organic matter into simpler compounds.

4. **Reproduction**: Fungi reproduce both **sexually** and **asexually**, depending on the species and environmental conditions. Asexual reproduction typically involves the production of spores, while sexual reproduction involves the fusion of specialized reproductive cells.

5. **Mycelium and Hyphae**: The body of a fungus is made up of a network of thread-like structures called **hyphae**. These hyphae collectively form a **mycelium**, which is the main growth structure of the fungus. Mycelium spreads out through soil, organic matter, or decaying material, absorbing nutrients.

6. **Spore Production**: Most fungi reproduce by producing **spores**, tiny reproductive units that can be spread by wind, water, or animals. Spores can develop into new fungal organisms when they land in a suitable environment.

### **Roles of Fungi in Ecosystems**

1. **Decomposers**: Fungi are vital decomposers in ecosystems. They break down dead organic material, such as plants, animals, and waste, releasing essential nutrients like carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus back into the soil. This process recycles nutrients and maintains soil health.

2. **Symbiotic Relationships**:
   - **Mycorrhizae**: Many fungi form mutualistic relationships with plant roots, known as **mycorrhizae**. In this relationship, the fungi provide plants with enhanced nutrient and water absorption, while the plants provide the fungi with carbohydrates.
   - **Lichens**: Fungi also form **lichens** by symbiotically partnering with algae or cyanobacteria. The fungi provide a structure for the algae, which perform photosynthesis and provide nutrients.

3. **Pathogens**: Some fungi are plant and animal pathogens. Fungal infections can cause significant agricultural losses, with diseases like **rust**, **smut**, and **blights** affecting crops. In humans, fungi can cause conditions like **athlete’s foot**, **ringworm**, and **candidiasis**.

4. **Fermentation**: Yeasts, a type of fungi, are used in fermentation processes to produce bread, beer, and wine. In this process, yeast converts sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide, allowing for the production of alcoholic beverages and the leavening of bread.

### **Fungi in Medicine and Industry**

1. **Antibiotics**: The discovery of the antibiotic **penicillin** from the fungus **Penicillium** revolutionized medicine. Fungi are a source of several other antibiotics, such as **cephalosporins**.

2. **Biotechnology**: Fungi are used in biotechnology to produce enzymes, organic acids, and biofuels. They play a crucial role in the production of **citric acid** (used in food and beverages), **enzymes** for detergents, and **bioethanol**.

3. **Immunosuppressants**: Fungi have provided important drugs like **cyclosporine**, used to suppress the immune system during organ transplants to prevent rejection.

### **Human Interaction and Fungal Diseases**

While fungi are beneficial in many ways, they can also pose health risks. Some fungi produce **mycotoxins**, toxic compounds that can contaminate food supplies, especially grains and nuts. **Aflatoxins**, for instance, are produced by **Aspergillus** species and can cause serious illness if ingested.

In humans, fungal infections (known as **mycoses**) can range from mild to life-threatening:
1. **Superficial Mycoses**: Affect skin, nails, and hair, such as **athlete's foot** and **ringworm**.
2. **Systemic Mycoses**: These are more severe, often occurring in immunocompromised individuals. Examples include **aspergillosis** and **histoplasmosis**, which can affect the lungs and other organs.

### **Environmental Impact and Fungi's Role in Climate**

Fungi are critical in carbon cycling. As decomposers, they break down organic matter, releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which plants then use for photosynthesis. Fungi also sequester carbon in the soil through their mycelium networks. However, deforestation and climate change can disrupt these processes, leading to imbalances in ecosystems.

### **Conclusion**

Fungi are an incredibly diverse and vital kingdom of life. From their role in decomposing organic matter to their contributions in medicine and biotechnology, fungi impact human life in countless ways. They not only sustain ecosystems by recycling nutrients but also form crucial partnerships with plants. While some fungi can be harmful, causing diseases and infections, their positive roles in nature and human society far outweigh the negatives.

> Fungi are a diverse group of eukaryotic organisms that include mushrooms, yeasts, and molds. They have chitin-based cell walls, reproduce through spores, and are heterotrophic, absorbing nutrients from organic matter. Fungi play key roles as decomposers, breaking down dead material and recycling nutrients in ecosystems. They form symbiotic relationships with plants (mycorrhizae) and algae (lichens) and are vital in industries like medicine (penicillin) and biotechnology (fermentation). While fungi provide numerous benefits, some can cause diseases in humans, plants, and animals. Their ecological importance and industrial uses make fungi essential to both natural and human systems.

# What special status is Ladakh seeking?

**Climate Activist Sonam Wangchuk Detained Amid Protests for Ladakh’s Inclusion in Sixth Schedule**

On Monday night, prominent climate activist and engineer **Sonam Wangchuk** was detained at the Delhi border while leading a group of protesters seeking to petition the Central government for the inclusion of **Ladakh** in the **Sixth Schedule** of the Indian Constitution. This move is part of a broader demand for greater autonomy and protection of Ladakh’s unique cultural and ecological identity, particularly in the wake of its status change in 2019 when Ladakh became a Union Territory, separated from Jammu and Kashmir. Wangchuk’s efforts reflect growing concerns within the region over its socio-economic future and environmental sustainability.

### **Context of the Protest**

Wangchuk and other activists are pushing for Ladakh’s inclusion in the **Sixth Schedule**, which provides special protections for tribal areas in certain states, allowing them autonomy over matters like land ownership, culture, and natural resources. Under the Sixth Schedule, tribal communities can manage their affairs through autonomous district and regional councils. These councils have legislative, judicial, and administrative powers, which are particularly useful for regions with distinct ethnic identities.

For Ladakh, a predominantly tribal region with a fragile ecological landscape, this demand is rooted in the fear that unchecked development and external influence could disrupt the region’s unique cultural heritage and environment. Local communities have expressed concern that Ladakh’s new status as a Union Territory has exposed it to large-scale industrial projects and an influx of people from other parts of India, potentially undermining the delicate ecological balance and the rights of indigenous people.

### **Demands for Autonomy and Protection**

Wangchuk’s protests are not only about the Sixth Schedule but also involve demands for broader **autonomy and self-governance**. Many residents of Ladakh feel that after the region’s bifurcation from Jammu and Kashmir, they were left with limited political representation. The absence of a legislative assembly, unlike other Union Territories such as Delhi and Puducherry, has fueled calls for greater local control over governance and decision-making processes.

In addition to Wangchuk’s demands, similar concerns have been raised in **Arunachal Pradesh** and **Manipur**, where indigenous groups are also pushing for their inclusion in the Sixth Schedule or equivalent protections. These northeastern states, like Ladakh, are home to several ethnic and tribal groups who feel vulnerable to cultural dilution, land alienation, and ecological degradation. Their demand stems from fears that external forces could overwhelm local populations, diminishing their control over natural resources, heritage, and cultural practices.

### **Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution**

The **Sixth Schedule** was originally designed to provide autonomy and protection to tribal communities in the northeastern states of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram. These provisions allow for the creation of autonomous district councils, which have powers over matters such as land rights, resource management, and local governance. This system enables local self-governance and ensures that tribal customs, laws, and traditions are preserved.

The demand for including Ladakh in this constitutional framework is seen as a way to safeguard the region’s indigenous population from the potential adverse effects of industrialization and demographic changes. Such inclusion would give the people of Ladakh greater control over land and resource management, helping them protect their ecological and cultural heritage.

### **Environmental and Cultural Concerns**

Ladakh’s high-altitude environment is extremely fragile and vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Wangchuk, known for his environmental activism, has frequently raised awareness about the dangers of ecological degradation in the region. The construction of large infrastructure projects, unchecked tourism, and the effects of climate change, such as glacier melt and water scarcity, pose serious threats to Ladakh’s sustainable future.

Wangchuk’s protest thus brings together both environmental concerns and the demand for political autonomy. By seeking inclusion in the Sixth Schedule, the people of Ladakh hope to manage their natural resources more sustainably, ensuring that economic development does not come at the cost of environmental destruction.

### **Conclusion**

Sonam Wangchuk’s detention highlights the growing discontent in Ladakh over the region’s political status and its future.

# The Myriad Tales of Historic Delhi: A Walk Through Its Many Forts

### The Myriad Tales of Historic Delhi: A Walk Through Its Many Forts

Delhi, India’s capital, is not just a bustling modern metropolis but a city steeped in history. Over the centuries, it has been the seat of several powerful dynasties, each leaving its architectural and cultural legacy. One of the most remarkable aspects of Delhi’s history is its **forts**—mighty structures that have stood the test of time, witnessing the rise and fall of empires. Walking through these forts is like stepping into the past, where the grandeur of bygone eras still lingers. Let’s explore some of Delhi’s most iconic forts and the fascinating stories they tell.

### 1. **Red Fort (Lal Qila)**

Arguably the most famous fort in Delhi, the **Red Fort** is a symbol of India's rich history and pride. Built by Mughal Emperor **Shah Jahan** in 1648, the fort served as the primary residence of the Mughal emperors for nearly 200 years. The majestic red sandstone walls of the fort stretch over 2 kilometers and stand at a height of 33 meters.

Inside, the fort houses beautiful structures such as the **Diwan-i-Aam** (Hall of Public Audience), **Diwan-i-Khas** (Hall of Private Audience), **Rang Mahal**, and **Moti Masjid**. The fort is not only an architectural marvel but also holds great political significance. Every year, on India’s Independence Day, the Prime Minister hoists the national flag at the fort and delivers a speech to the nation. The fort stands as a symbol of India's colonial past and the struggle for freedom.

### 2. **Purana Qila (Old Fort)**

The **Purana Qila**, or **Old Fort**, is one of the oldest forts in Delhi, with its origins possibly tracing back to the ancient city of **Indraprastha**, believed to be established by the Pandavas from the Mahabharata. The fort, as it stands today, was primarily built by **Sher Shah Suri** in the 16th century, though construction began during the reign of the Mughal Emperor Humayun.

The Purana Qila exudes a mix of Mughal and Afghan architectural styles. The massive walls, gateways, and bastions give the fort an imposing presence. Inside the fort, you’ll find the **Qila-i-Kuhna Mosque**, a beautiful example of early Mughal architecture, and the **Sher Mandal**, a double-storeyed tower where Humayun is said to have met his tragic end. The Purana Qila overlooks the Yamuna River and offers a glimpse into Delhi’s early history and urban planning.

### 3. **Tughlaqabad Fort**

The **Tughlaqabad Fort**, built by **Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq** in 1321, is a vast ruin today, but in its time, it was a formidable fortress. Tughlaqabad was envisioned as a grand city with impregnable defenses, featuring massive stone walls, high towers, and a maze of underground tunnels. Ghiyasuddin's ambition was to create the strongest fort in Delhi, protecting the empire from Mongol invasions.

However, the fort was abandoned soon after his death due to a curse, according to local legend, by the Sufi saint **Nizamuddin Auliya**. The story goes that the emperor and the saint had a feud, and the saint cursed the fort, saying, "Ya rahe ujjar, ya base gujjar" (It shall either remain deserted or be occupied by herdsmen). Today, the fort stands in partial ruins, offering a haunting yet awe-inspiring glimpse into Delhi’s medieval history.

### 4. **Siri Fort**

The **Siri Fort** was built by **Alauddin Khilji** in the early 14th century as part of the city of Siri, the second city of Delhi. This fort was constructed to defend Delhi from Mongol invasions and was a military stronghold during Khilji’s reign. The fort is said to have been constructed using the heads of 8,000 Mongols slain by Alauddin Khilji in battle, though much of the fort is now in ruins.

Despite its dilapidated condition, the remnants of Siri Fort still stand as a testament to Khilji’s military prowess. The **Siri Fort Auditorium**, a modern structure, is now a prominent cultural venue in Delhi, but the fort itself remains a symbol of the Delhi Sultanate’s resistance against invaders.

### 5. **Feroz Shah Kotla**

Built by **Feroz Shah Tughlaq** in the 14th century, the **Feroz Shah Kotla** fort was part of a new capital city, Ferozabad. The fort is famous for housing the **Ashokan Pillar**, which Feroz Shah transported from Ambala to Delhi. The fort itself has a peaceful and almost mystical ambiance today, especially because of the legends surrounding the presence of **djinns**—supernatural beings believed to inhabit the ruins.

Every Thursday, devotees come to the fort to offer prayers and write letters to the djinns, asking for their wishes to be granted. Despite its present-day tranquility, Feroz Shah Kotla once stood as a significant political and military center during Tughlaq’s reign.

### **Conclusion**

Delhi’s forts are not just architectural marvels but are also repositories of rich history and folklore. Walking through these ancient structures, one can feel the pulse of the empires that rose and fell within their walls. From the grandeur of the Red Fort to the legends of Tughlaqabad, each fort tells a unique story of conquest, defense, and legacy. These forts remind us of the historical importance of Delhi as a center of power and culture, inviting us to reflect on its complex past and dynamic present.

# National Mission on Edible Oils – Oil Palm (NMEO-OP)

### National Mission on Edible Oils – Oil Palm (NMEO-OP): Detailed Explanation

The **National Mission on Edible Oils – Oil Palm (NMEO-OP)** is a key initiative launched by the Government of India in 2021, aimed at boosting the production of edible oils, particularly **oil palm**, in the country. This mission addresses the critical need for self-reliance in edible oil production, given India’s heavy reliance on imports to meet its growing domestic demand. The mission is part of India’s broader push for **Atmanirbhar Bharat** (self-reliant India) and focuses on sustainable production, increasing oil palm cultivation, and reducing the country’s edible oil import dependency.

### **Background and Need for the NMEO-OP**

India is one of the largest consumers of edible oils globally, with **palm oil** being the most widely consumed type. Despite this, India heavily depends on imports for around **60% of its edible oil** requirements, with a substantial portion being imported from countries like Indonesia and Malaysia. The rising import bills, coupled with global price fluctuations, make the edible oil sector a critical area for intervention.

The government has recognized the urgent need to increase domestic production to reduce dependence on imports and achieve greater self-sufficiency in edible oils. This is where the **NMEO-OP** comes in, with a focus on cultivating oil palm, a crop that has a higher yield of oil per hectare compared to other oilseed crops like mustard, soybean, or sunflower.

### **Objectives of NMEO-OP**

The primary goal of the NMEO-OP is to boost oil palm cultivation in the country and increase the domestic production of edible oils, particularly palm oil. The specific objectives of the mission include:

1. **Enhancing Area Under Oil Palm Cultivation**: The mission aims to expand the area under oil palm cultivation to meet the growing demand for edible oils. The focus will be on **North-Eastern states** and the **Andaman and Nicobar Islands**, which have suitable agro-climatic conditions for oil palm cultivation.

2. **Boosting Domestic Oil Production**: By increasing oil palm cultivation, the mission seeks to raise the domestic production of crude palm oil (CPO) from **2.5 lakh metric tonnes (LMT)** to **11 LMT** by 2025-26. The long-term goal is to make India self-sufficient in edible oils by producing a larger share domestically.

3. **Financial and Technical Support for Farmers**: The government will provide financial assistance to farmers for oil palm cultivation. This includes support for purchasing high-quality seedlings, inputs like fertilizers, and assistance for setting up processing units. The mission also emphasizes **technical support** for farmers through extension services and awareness campaigns to adopt better farming practices.

4. **Price Assurance Mechanism**: One of the significant concerns for oil palm farmers is the volatility of crude palm oil prices. To address this, the government has introduced a **Viability Price (VP)** mechanism. This price assurance will protect farmers by ensuring a fixed minimum price for fresh fruit bunches (FFBs), offering stability and reducing risk for cultivators.

5. **Research and Development**: The mission will encourage research and development to enhance the productivity of oil palm. This includes the development of high-yielding varieties, disease resistance, and innovations in processing techniques to improve efficiency.

### **Key Features of the NMEO-OP**

1. **Focus on North-East and Andaman & Nicobar**: The mission targets expanding oil palm cultivation in the North-Eastern states, including **Assam**, **Arunachal Pradesh**, and **Tripura**, as well as the **Andaman and Nicobar Islands**. These regions have suitable climatic conditions, with sufficient rainfall and humid environments that support oil palm growth.

2. **Financial Outlay**: The government has allocated a substantial budget for the mission. The total financial outlay of the NMEO-OP is **₹11,040 crore**. Out of this, **₹8,844 crore** is set aside specifically for oil palm expansion. The mission includes provisions for financial support to farmers during the gestation period of oil palm, as the crop takes a few years to start yielding oil.

3. **Encouraging Oil Palm Cultivation**: Farmers will be incentivized to switch to oil palm due to its high productivity. Oil palm produces more oil per hectare compared to other oilseeds, making it an attractive option for farmers. For example, oil palm can yield **4 to 6 tonnes of oil per hectare**, while traditional oilseeds like mustard and sunflower yield much less.

4. **Sustainability and Environmental Concerns**: While oil palm cultivation is known for its high yields, it has faced criticism globally for leading to deforestation, especially in countries like Indonesia and Malaysia. The Indian government aims to ensure that oil palm expansion under the NMEO-OP is done in an environmentally sustainable manner. The mission emphasizes expanding oil palm cultivation in fallow lands, degraded lands, and non-forest areas to avoid deforestation and biodiversity loss.

5. **Inter-Ministerial Collaboration**: The mission involves collaboration between various ministries, including the **Ministry of Agriculture**, **Ministry of Food Processing Industries**, and the **Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change**, to ensure smooth implementation and adherence to environmental norms.

### **Challenges and Concerns**

1. **Environmental Impact**: While the government has stressed sustainable cultivation, there are concerns about the environmental impact of large-scale oil palm plantations. In other parts of the world, oil palm cultivation has led to deforestation and loss of biodiversity. Ensuring that oil palm expansion does not come at the cost of India’s natural habitats is a significant challenge.

2. **Farmer Awareness and Support**: Oil palm is a relatively new crop for many Indian farmers. Educating and training farmers on best practices for oil palm cultivation, processing, and managing risks will be crucial for the success of the mission.

3. **Gestation Period**: Oil palm has a longer gestation period, taking about 4 to 5 years to yield fruit after planting. Ensuring that farmers have adequate financial support during this period will be critical, as they won’t see immediate returns on their investments.

4. **Price Volatility**: The global price of crude palm oil can be volatile, making it difficult for farmers to plan ahead. While the Viability Price mechanism is a good step, continued support may be needed to safeguard farmers from price fluctuations in international markets.

### **Expected Outcomes**

1. **Increased Domestic Production**: By 2025-26, India aims to increase its production of crude palm oil to 11 LMT, reducing its dependency on imports and improving self-reliance.

2. **Reduced Import Bill**: India’s edible oil import bill is significant, and the NMEO-OP seeks to reduce this burden by encouraging domestic production. The mission is expected to save foreign exchange reserves by cutting down imports.

3. **Employment Generation**: The expansion of oil palm cultivation will create jobs in both farming and allied sectors, such as processing and logistics. The increased economic activity is expected to benefit rural areas, especially in the North-East and the Andaman & Nicobar Islands.

4. **Increased Farmer Incomes**: With high yields and assured pricing mechanisms, oil palm cultivation has the potential to significantly improve the incomes of farmers who switch to this crop.

### **Conclusion**

The **National Mission on Edible Oils – Oil Palm (NMEO-OP)** is a bold initiative by the Indian government to address the country's dependence on edible oil imports and to boost domestic production, particularly of palm oil. Through financial incentives, technical support, and price protection mechanisms, the mission seeks to encourage sustainable oil palm cultivation while protecting farmers from market volatility. If implemented effectively, NMEO-OP could have far-reaching benefits for India’s agricultural sector, reduce the country’s import bill, and ensure long-term food security. However, careful attention to environmental sustainability and farmer education will be key to the mission’s success.

# Modi says toilet coverage reached 100% after launch of Swachh Bharat Mission

**10 Years of Swachh Bharat Mission: A Remarkable Transformation in Sanitation**

On Wednesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that more than 12 crore toilets have been constructed across India under the **Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM)**, achieving 100% toilet coverage, a significant leap from the less than 40% coverage before the program was launched. The Swachh Bharat Mission, initiated on October 2, 2014, aims to eliminate open defecation and improve sanitation conditions across India, thereby promoting public health, cleanliness, and hygiene.

### **The Genesis of Swachh Bharat Mission**

Swachh Bharat Mission was launched as a nationwide campaign to address the pressing issue of open defecation and inadequate sanitation facilities, especially in rural areas. The mission was inspired by Mahatma Gandhi’s vision of a clean and hygienic India. When the mission was introduced, sanitation coverage in India was dismal, with less than 40% of households having access to proper toilets. This lack of sanitation led to various public health issues, including the spread of waterborne diseases, infant mortality, and malnutrition.

The mission was divided into two components:
1. **Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin)** – Focusing on rural areas.
2. **Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban)** – Targeting urban centers.

### **Key Achievements**

**1. Construction of Over 12 Crore Toilets**  
One of the most remarkable achievements of the SBM is the construction of over 12 crore toilets in both rural and urban India. These toilets have been crucial in eradicating open defecation in the country, especially in rural areas where access to basic sanitation facilities was severely lacking. By building toilets at an unprecedented scale, the SBM has brought dignity, safety, and improved hygiene to millions of households.

**2. Declaring India Open Defecation Free (ODF)**  
In 2019, India was declared **Open Defecation Free (ODF)**. This was a historic milestone for a country that, just a decade ago, had one of the highest numbers of people practicing open defecation globally. The declaration of ODF status reflects the transformation of sanitation habits across the country, achieved through consistent efforts by the government, local bodies, and active community participation.

**3. Behavioral Change**  
Beyond infrastructure development, SBM has also focused on creating awareness about the importance of hygiene and sanitation. The mission has succeeded in changing people’s behavior by emphasizing the health hazards associated with open defecation and unsanitary conditions. Various awareness campaigns, like the use of radio, television, and social media, have been used to spread the message. Celebrities and influencers were roped in to make sanitation a mainstream conversation topic.

**4. Women’s Safety and Dignity**  
The construction of household toilets has significantly improved the safety and dignity of women and girls, particularly in rural areas. Previously, women had to walk long distances to find secluded places for defecation, often before sunrise or after sunset, putting them at risk of harassment and violence. With toilets now available within or near their homes, women’s safety and privacy have been greatly enhanced.

**5. Public Health and Hygiene Improvement**  
Improved sanitation has also had a positive impact on public health. The elimination of open defecation has helped reduce the spread of diseases like diarrhea, cholera, and other waterborne illnesses, which were previously rampant due to contamination of drinking water sources. Cleanliness and better hygiene practices have also contributed to lower infant mortality rates and improved child health and nutrition.

### **Challenges and the Way Forward**

While the achievements of the SBM are commendable, challenges remain. Maintaining the ODF status and ensuring the sustainability of sanitation practices is crucial. Some rural areas still face water scarcity, which affects the regular use of toilets. The government must continue to focus on ensuring water supply to all households and improving waste management systems, especially in urban areas.

Additionally, behavioral change needs to be continuously reinforced, as some people might revert to open defecation if toilets are not maintained or water access is limited. Ongoing community engagement and education will be essential in ensuring that the gains of the SBM are not lost.

### **Conclusion**

The Swachh Bharat Mission, launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi 10 years ago, has brought about a revolution in sanitation and cleanliness in India. The construction of over 12 crore toilets, achieving 100% coverage from less than 40%, has transformed the nation’s landscape and dramatically improved public health, hygiene, and dignity. However, the journey does not end here. Ensuring the sustainability of these achievements through continuous efforts, community engagement, and infrastructure maintenance will be crucial in keeping India clean and healthy for future generations.
