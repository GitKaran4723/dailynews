# 1% to 2% welfare cess to be levied on each online transaction

Labour Minister Santosh Lad recently announced the introduction of a 1%-2% “welfare cess” on every transaction made via online aggregator platforms, such as food delivery or ride-hailing apps, to establish a welfare fund for gig workers. This initiative, outlined in the **Karnataka Platform Based Gig Workers (Social Security and Welfare) Bill, 2024**, aims to address the lack of social security and welfare benefits for gig workers, who often face precarious working conditions without formal employment benefits like health insurance, pensions, or job security.

### Context and Purpose

Gig workers, primarily those engaged with platforms such as **Swiggy**, **Zomato**, **Uber**, and **Ola**, often lack access to essential social security measures due to their informal employment status. Unlike regular employees, gig workers are typically classified as independent contractors, which means they do not benefit from formal labor protections, including minimum wages, provident funds, or healthcare benefits. With the rapid growth of the gig economy, especially in urban areas, this lack of social safety nets has become a pressing concern for policymakers and labor rights advocates.

The **Karnataka Platform Based Gig Workers Bill** addresses this gap by proposing a welfare fund specifically for gig workers. The draft bill suggests two methods for funding this initiative:
1. **A cess on every transaction**: This would involve a small percentage (1%-2%) being added to the cost of each transaction made on online platforms. The additional charge would go directly into the welfare fund for gig workers.
2. **A fee on the annual turnover of aggregator platforms**: This option proposes that companies like Uber, Ola, Zomato, and others contribute a portion of their annual revenue towards the gig workers' welfare fund.

The final decision on which funding mechanism will be implemented is yet to be confirmed, but the cess on transactions seems to be the more likely option based on current announcements.

### Significance for Gig Workers

The creation of a gig workers' welfare fund is a significant step towards formalizing the gig economy and ensuring that workers receive essential benefits. Gig workers, who often face uncertain incomes and challenging working conditions, would benefit greatly from a structured welfare system. The fund could provide benefits such as:
- **Health insurance**: Covering medical expenses for gig workers, ensuring they have access to healthcare when needed.
- **Accident insurance**: Protecting workers from financial losses due to accidents or injuries sustained while on the job.
- **Pension schemes**: Offering retirement benefits for long-term gig workers, providing them with financial security in old age.
- **Emergency financial aid**: Providing support to gig workers during unforeseen events, such as a pandemic or other crises that impact their ability to work.

### Impact on Aggregator Platforms

While the welfare cess would benefit workers, it could also affect online aggregator platforms financially. Platforms may face increased operational costs due to the additional levy and might decide to pass on the cost to consumers by raising prices for their services. Alternatively, platforms could absorb the cost, impacting their profit margins.

The move could also prompt these companies to re-evaluate their business models and employment structures, potentially leading to more permanent or semi-permanent contracts for gig workers. Additionally, online platforms might explore ways to improve working conditions for gig workers, reducing turnover and ensuring a more stable workforce in the long run.

### Challenges and Future Considerations

Although the welfare fund is a positive step, there are potential challenges. The successful implementation of the cess and distribution of welfare benefits will require robust systems for tracking transactions, collecting funds, and distributing benefits fairly. Ensuring transparency and efficiency in the fund's administration will be crucial to maintaining the trust of gig workers and platform companies alike.

Moreover, the long-term sustainability of the welfare fund will depend on the effectiveness of the cess or fee mechanism and whether it can adapt to the growing demands of an ever-expanding gig workforce.

### Conclusion

The 1%-2% welfare cess proposed by the **Karnataka Platform Based Gig Workers Bill, 2024**, is a vital initiative aimed at addressing the social security needs of gig workers. By creating a dedicated welfare fund, the Karnataka government seeks to provide much-needed benefits such as health insurance, pensions, and financial aid to a vulnerable segment of the workforce. However, its success will depend on careful planning, efficient execution, and cooperation between the government, online platforms, and gig workers to ensure that the benefits reach those who need them most.

# L-G clears resolution urging Centre to restore Statehood

Jammu and Kashmir Lieutenant-Governor Manoj Sinha has approved a resolution urging the Centre to restore statehood to the Union Territory (UT) of Jammu and Kashmir. This resolution, passed unanimously by the Cabinet chaired by former Chief Minister Omar Abdullah, reflects the growing demand to revert the UT’s status to that of a full-fledged state, which was altered in August 2019 when Jammu and Kashmir was reorganized and its special status under Article 370 was revoked.

### Background: Revocation of Article 370 and Reorganization

On August 5, 2019, the Government of India, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, made a historic move by revoking the special status granted to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 of the Indian Constitution. The state was bifurcated into two Union Territories: Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. This reorganization stripped Jammu and Kashmir of its autonomy, converting it from a state with its own constitution and legislative powers to a Union Territory under tighter central control.

The government justified the move by arguing that it would lead to better governance, development, and integration of the region with the rest of the country. However, the decision was met with widespread opposition, both within the region and from various political parties. Many believed that the revocation undermined the identity and autonomy of the people of Jammu and Kashmir, and there were immediate calls for the restoration of statehood.

### The Resolution for Restoration of Statehood

The recent resolution passed by the Cabinet, under Omar Abdullah’s leadership, is a significant step toward addressing the demands of political parties and citizens who wish to see Jammu and Kashmir restored to its status as a state. The resolution specifically calls for the "restoration of statehood in its original form," meaning the return of a full legislative assembly and greater autonomy for the region.

The move by the Lieutenant-Governor to clear this resolution indicates that the demand for statehood has gained momentum across the political spectrum in Jammu and Kashmir. It also signals that discussions around the region’s political future are gaining traction. The government spokesperson emphasized that the resolution was passed unanimously, reflecting widespread support for the cause.

### Political Implications

Restoring statehood has become a critical issue for political parties in Jammu and Kashmir. Since the region’s reorganization, leaders like Omar Abdullah of the National Conference (NC) and Mehbooba Mufti of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have consistently advocated for a return to statehood. For them, the revocation of Article 370 and the subsequent downgrading to Union Territory status was seen as an affront to the region's identity and political autonomy.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been more cautious on the issue of statehood, focusing instead on development and integration. However, the central government has indicated that statehood will eventually be restored, although no specific timeline has been provided.

Restoring statehood is seen as a way to address the growing political discontent in the region. Many in Jammu and Kashmir believe that the loss of statehood has marginalized local voices and diluted the region’s political representation. With statehood, the region would regain a legislative assembly with the power to legislate on important issues, giving back political agency to the people.

### Security and Development Considerations

One of the main reasons for the revocation of Article 370 and the reorganization of Jammu and Kashmir was to improve the region’s security situation and promote development. The central government argued that the special status had led to corruption, underdevelopment, and separatism, preventing the region from fully integrating with the rest of India.

Since 2019, the government has undertaken several development initiatives aimed at improving infrastructure, education, healthcare, and tourism in Jammu and Kashmir. Security forces have also intensified operations against militancy, and the government claims that these efforts have led to a more stable environment.

However, critics argue that development alone cannot address the underlying political and social discontent in the region. They contend that restoring statehood is essential to ensuring that the people of Jammu and Kashmir have a say in their governance and can address their own unique challenges.

### The Road Ahead

The resolution passed by Omar Abdullah’s Cabinet and cleared by Lieutenant-Governor Manoj Sinha represents a significant development in the ongoing debate over Jammu and Kashmir’s political future. While the restoration of statehood has widespread support, the central government will ultimately decide whether and when this change will occur.

The next steps will likely involve discussions between regional leaders and the central government. If the Centre agrees to restore statehood, it could mark a turning point in Jammu and Kashmir’s political landscape, potentially addressing some of the grievances that have persisted since the revocation of Article 370.

In conclusion, the demand for the restoration of statehood in Jammu and Kashmir is gaining momentum, with political leaders across the spectrum advocating for a return to the region’s previous status. While development and security have been central to the government’s plans for Jammu and Kashmir, restoring statehood could provide the region with the political autonomy it needs to address its unique challenges and ensure long-term stability.

> Jammu and Kashmir Lieutenant-Governor Manoj Sinha has approved a resolution passed by the Cabinet, led by Omar Abdullah, urging the central government to restore statehood to the Union Territory (UT) of Jammu and Kashmir. The resolution, passed unanimously, seeks to return Jammu and Kashmir to its original statehood status, which was revoked in August 2019 when the region was reorganized and its special status under Article 370 was removed. Restoring statehood has become a key demand among political leaders in the region, who argue that it is essential for restoring political autonomy and addressing local grievances.

# India to seek certification from WHO for eliminating Kala-azar

India is on the verge of eliminating **Kala-azar**, also known as visceral leishmaniasis, as a public health problem and will soon seek certification from the **World Health Organization (WHO)**. For two consecutive years, the country has managed to reduce the number of Kala-azar cases to fewer than one per 10,000 people at the sub-district level, meeting WHO's criteria for elimination. This progress is a significant achievement in India’s public health sector, particularly for regions where Kala-azar has historically been a major concern.

### What is Kala-azar?

**Kala-azar** is a life-threatening disease caused by a protozoan parasite called **Leishmania donovani**, which is transmitted through the bite of an infected female sandfly. The disease primarily affects poor and marginalized communities in rural areas with symptoms including prolonged irregular fever, significant weight loss, fatigue, anemia, and an enlarged spleen and liver.

If untreated, Kala-azar can be fatal, but early diagnosis and treatment can help patients recover fully. The disease has been endemic in parts of India for decades, particularly in regions like **Bihar**, **Jharkhand**, **West Bengal**, and parts of **Uttar Pradesh**, where socio-economic and environmental factors make the population vulnerable to the disease.

### India’s Efforts to Eliminate Kala-azar

India has been working to eliminate Kala-azar for several decades. The country’s **National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP)** has implemented numerous initiatives aimed at controlling the disease. These include early diagnosis, prompt treatment, sandfly control, community awareness, and regular surveillance to track cases.

The primary focus of the program has been on:
1. **Timely Diagnosis and Treatment**: Ensuring that suspected cases are identified early and treated promptly with drugs that can effectively cure the infection.
2. **Vector Control**: Reducing the population of sandflies through indoor residual spraying with insecticides, thus lowering transmission rates.
3. **Community Engagement**: Increasing awareness in endemic areas about symptoms, transmission, and the importance of seeking treatment to prevent disease spread.

The government has also worked closely with international organizations like WHO, which has provided technical support and guidelines for implementing elimination strategies.

### Meeting the WHO Criteria for Elimination

The WHO defines the **elimination of Kala-azar as a public health problem** when the incidence is reduced to less than one case per 10,000 people at the sub-district level for three consecutive years. India has successfully met this criterion for two consecutive years and is now on track to complete the third year, after which it will seek certification from WHO.

Achieving this milestone is crucial because it demonstrates that the country has been able to control the transmission of the disease to a manageable level, preventing large outbreaks and protecting vulnerable populations. The decrease in cases also indicates that the interventions—such as vector control and early treatment—are working effectively.

### Challenges and Next Steps

While India has made significant progress in controlling Kala-azar, challenges remain. Maintaining low transmission rates over the long term will require sustained efforts in disease surveillance, vector control, and community engagement. There is always the risk of re-emergence, particularly if vector control efforts falter or if migration from high-endemic areas introduces new cases into controlled areas.

To ensure sustained progress, the following steps are essential:
- **Continued Surveillance**: Strong surveillance systems must be maintained to promptly identify any new cases and prevent outbreaks. This will include monitoring areas that have already achieved low transmission rates.
- **Sustained Vector Control**: Sandfly populations must continue to be controlled through regular spraying and environmental management, particularly in endemic regions.
- **Capacity Building**: Health workers and local communities should remain vigilant and equipped with the resources and knowledge to manage Kala-azar in case of re-emergence.
- **Post-Elimination Strategy**: Even after certification, India will need a long-term plan for preventing Kala-azar, including maintaining resources for vector control, diagnostics, and treatment.

### Conclusion

India’s success in bringing down Kala-azar cases to fewer than one per 10,000 people for two consecutive years is a major milestone in the country’s fight against the disease. With WHO certification in sight, India is well on its way to eliminating Kala-azar as a public health problem. However, continued vigilance, sustained interventions, and robust public health infrastructure will be essential to ensuring that the disease does not make a comeback. This achievement stands as a testament to India’s commitment to tackling infectious diseases and improving the health outcomes of its most vulnerable populations.

> India is on the brink of eliminating **Kala-azar** as a public health problem, having successfully reduced cases to fewer than one per 10,000 people for two consecutive years, meeting **WHO**'s elimination criteria. The disease, caused by a protozoan parasite and transmitted by sandflies, has primarily affected regions like **Bihar**, **Jharkhand**, **West Bengal**, and parts of **Uttar Pradesh**. India's efforts, including early diagnosis, treatment, vector control, and community engagement, have been crucial in reducing cases. While seeking WHO certification, India must continue surveillance, vector control, and health initiatives to prevent a resurgence and ensure long-term success.

# Company uses mining dust to enhance carbon capture

**Alt Carbon**, a Darjeeling-based company, is tackling climate change through an innovative approach that uses dust from mining in a geo-chemical process called **enhanced rock weathering**. This process has the potential to capture carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, offering a unique method of carbon sequestration. Surprisingly, dust, which is typically seen as a byproduct of mining and a pollutant, can, when applied correctly, become a tool to combat global warming.

### What is Enhanced Rock Weathering?

**Enhanced rock weathering** is a natural geo-chemical process wherein certain types of rocks, particularly basalt, chemically react with CO2 when exposed to the atmosphere. This reaction transforms the CO2 into stable minerals, effectively locking it away and removing it from the air. Normally, this process takes millions of years, but by grinding the rock into fine dust and spreading it over large areas like farmlands, the rate of CO2 absorption can be significantly accelerated. The key benefit is that the dust enhances natural soil fertility, simultaneously supporting agricultural productivity and capturing carbon.

### Alt Carbon’s Approach

Alt Carbon has recognized the potential of this process and turned it into a viable business. The company collects specific types of rock dust from mining operations, which are usually discarded as waste. By repurposing this dust and distributing it in suitable areas, Alt Carbon accelerates the natural rock weathering process, allowing it to absorb CO2 more effectively.

The company's approach has already attracted substantial attention and investment. Alt Carbon has secured **$500,000** in funding from carbon-credit companies that are increasingly looking for innovative ways to reduce carbon emissions. The carbon credits generated from this process can be sold to businesses looking to offset their carbon footprint, making Alt Carbon's model both environmentally beneficial and commercially viable.

### Impact on Climate Change

The climate benefits of enhanced rock weathering are significant. According to studies, spreading basalt rock dust over large tracts of land could capture billions of tons of CO2 annually. Unlike other carbon sequestration technologies, such as direct air capture (DAC), which requires expensive equipment and energy, enhanced rock weathering uses natural processes that are energy-efficient and scalable. The additional benefit of improving soil health and increasing agricultural yields makes it a promising solution, especially in regions where farming plays a crucial role in local economies.

### Investments and Future Potential

Alt Carbon's model has garnered investment due to its promising approach to tackling climate change while simultaneously creating economic opportunities in regions with mining operations. The growing demand for **carbon credits** from industries looking to meet net-zero targets has provided companies like Alt Carbon with an attractive market for their climate-friendly initiatives.

Additionally, as the effects of climate change become more severe, carbon capture technologies like enhanced rock weathering will play an increasingly important role in global efforts to limit CO2 emissions. By creating a scalable solution, Alt Carbon is positioning itself as a key player in the emerging field of natural carbon sequestration.

### Challenges and Considerations

While the technology holds great promise, there are challenges that need to be addressed for enhanced rock weathering to reach its full potential. The logistics of transporting and spreading rock dust over large areas can be complex and costly. Moreover, the effectiveness of the process depends on several factors, including the type of rock used, climate conditions, and soil properties. Long-term studies are still needed to fully understand the environmental impacts and the scalability of the technology.

Additionally, while carbon credits provide a financial incentive for businesses to invest in these projects, the carbon market is still evolving. Regulatory frameworks and market mechanisms will need to be strengthened to ensure that carbon credits from natural sequestration projects like Alt Carbon's are accurately verified and appropriately valued.

### Conclusion

Alt Carbon's innovative approach of using mining dust for enhanced rock weathering presents a promising solution to combat climate change. By capturing CO2 from the atmosphere and improving soil fertility, the company is not only contributing to carbon sequestration but also providing environmental and economic benefits. With growing investments in carbon credits and the increasing global focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, Alt Carbon is well-positioned to expand its operations and contribute to a more sustainable future. However, addressing logistical and scalability challenges will be crucial for this technology to realize its full potential.

**Carbon capture** refers to a set of technologies and processes aimed at capturing carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions from industrial activities, power plants, or directly from the atmosphere, to prevent them from entering the atmosphere and contributing to climate change. The captured CO₂ is either stored safely underground (a process known as **carbon capture and storage, or CCS**) or used in various industrial applications (**carbon capture, utilization, and storage, or CCUS**). This technology is crucial for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating global warming.

### Key Steps in Carbon Capture:
1. **Capture**:
   - **Pre-combustion capture**: CO₂ is separated from fuels before combustion, often used in gasification plants.
   - **Post-combustion capture**: CO₂ is captured after burning fossil fuels, typically in coal or natural gas power plants.
   - **Oxy-fuel combustion**: Combustion is carried out in oxygen instead of air, resulting in a CO₂-rich exhaust gas that is easier to capture.

2. **Transportation**:
   - Once captured, CO₂ is compressed into a liquid or dense gas and transported via pipelines, ships, or trucks to storage sites.

3. **Storage**:
   - The captured CO₂ is injected into deep underground geological formations, such as depleted oil and gas fields or saline aquifers, where it is stored permanently.
   
4. **Utilization (Optional)**:
   - In CCUS, the captured CO₂ is utilized in various industries, such as enhancing oil recovery in oil fields, producing building materials, or converting CO₂ into useful products like fuels and chemicals.

### Importance of Carbon Capture:
- **Climate Change Mitigation**: Carbon capture reduces the amount of CO₂ released into the atmosphere, helping to meet global climate targets, including the goal of limiting global warming to below 2°C as outlined in the Paris Agreement.
- **Reducing Industrial Emissions**: It can help decarbonize sectors that are difficult to electrify, such as cement, steel, and chemical industries, which are significant sources of emissions.
- **Negative Emissions**: When combined with bioenergy (BECCS) or direct air capture (DAC), carbon capture can result in net negative emissions, meaning more CO₂ is removed from the atmosphere than emitted.

### Challenges of Carbon Capture:
- **Cost**: The technology can be expensive to implement, particularly in terms of capturing and storing the CO₂.
- **Infrastructure**: Transporting and storing CO₂ requires extensive infrastructure, including pipelines and suitable geological storage sites.
- **Energy Use**: The process of capturing and compressing CO₂ can be energy-intensive, reducing the overall efficiency of power plants.

### Conclusion:
Carbon capture is a vital tool in reducing global CO₂ emissions, particularly in industries that are hard to decarbonize. While it presents challenges in terms of cost and infrastructure, its role in mitigating climate change and contributing to long-term sustainability makes it a key component of future carbon reduction strategies.

> Alt Carbon, a Darjeeling-based company, utilizes mining dust in a process called **enhanced rock weathering** to capture CO2 from the atmosphere, combating climate change. This natural geo-chemical process accelerates carbon sequestration by spreading basalt rock dust over large areas, turning CO2 into stable minerals.

# How will a classical status help languages?

The Union Cabinet approved classical status for five languages earlier this month — Marathi, Bengali, Assamese, Pali, and Prakrit — by tweaking the criteria for the declaration.

### What makes a language classical?

When the new UPA-led Union government introduced the classical status for Indian languages in 2004, it defined them using three criteria: that its earliest texts or recorded history dated back over a thousand years; that it had a body of ancient literature considered a valuable heritage by generations of speakers; and that its literary tradition must be original and not borrowed from another speech community. Tamil was the first language declared to be classical. In 2005, these criteria were tweaked to push back the historical requirement to 1,500 to 2,000 years and to stipulate that “the classical language and literature being distinct from modern, there may also be a discontinuity between the classical language and its later forms or its offshoots”. Under these norms, five more languages were declared as classical over the next decade: Sanskrit, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, and Odia.

### How did these languages attain this status?

“In 2012, the Pathare committee was set up to develop the proposal [for Marathi to be declared a classical language] with evidence from old documents. It was finally submitted to the [Union Culture Ministry’s] Linguistic Experts Committee [LEC] in November 2013,” says Sadanand More, chairman of the Maharashtra State Literature and Culture Board. In July 2014, then-Congress Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan presented the proposal to the newly elected Modi-led government at the Centre, and State governments led by the BJP and Shiv Sena continued to pursue the matter for a decade. “Over a lakh people sent postcards to the President, MPs asked questions in Parliament, someone went to court…” says Dr. More. Noting that Marathi has at least 2,000 years of consistent history, he claimed that Maharashtri Prakrit was an original language, unlike other forms of Prakrit which are derivative.

In July 2024, the LEC removed the requirement that any proposed language’s “literary tradition must be original and not borrowed from another speech community”, and added a requirement for “knowledge texts, especially prose texts in addition to poetry, epigraphical and inscriptional evidence”. It also said a classical language “could be” distinct from its current form.

These new criteria paved the way for not just Marathi, but also Bengali and Assamese, which are also modern languages in current use. “We submitted a 392-page report to the Culture Ministry in March 2021 tracing the history of Assamese to prove its antiquity. Stone inscriptions go as far back as the third century AD. There are copper plates and manuscripts written on the bark of the Sanchi tree, as well as extensive folklore and folksongs in Assamese,” Kuladhar Saikia, former president of the Assam Sahitya Sabha said, noting that the popular drive to protect Assamese comes from a colonial history of attempted language erasure. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had, in January 2024, sent a four-volume report to the Centre, seeking classical status for Bengali on the grounds of concrete evidence proving that it existed as a written language as far back as the 3rd or 4th century BCE.

### What lies ahead for the newly declared classical languages?

“It is important that the language in which Nobel Prize winner Rabindranath Tagore wrote is recognised as a classical language, at a time when many people are reluctant to speak in Bangla,” says Nrisingha Prasad Bhaduri, a writer, historian and Indologist. “So many Bengali works are awaiting translation. Bengali dialects also need support. This will also help research proposals in Bangla to get central funds.” The Centre has funded universities for Sanskrit and Tamil and centres of excellence and university chairs for the other existing classical languages, as well as national and international awards. Central budget grants for classical languages have ranged from ₹51 crore for Tamil in the last decade to ₹3.7 crore for Malayalam since 2020.

“There are so many rock inscriptions in Assamese which are yet to be deciphered, and this will support researchers seeking to study the ancient language and translate Assamese classics,” says Mr. Saikia. “But we also hope it will give a fillip to the learning and use of modern Assamese, given the rise of English-medium schools. Our report proved that our language has deep roots. Now we must ensure that it also has support to spread its leaves and branches.”

> Classical status for a language provides it with official recognition and grants special funding and support to preserve and promote its rich heritage. It encourages scholarly research, documentation, and translation of ancient texts, helping to protect linguistic traditions. Languages with classical status receive financial assistance for establishing study centers, promoting academic research, and developing language resources, like dictionaries and grammar guides. Additionally, this status enhances the prestige of the language, fostering cultural pride and encouraging younger generations to learn and use it. Overall, classical status aids in preserving the historical and cultural significance of a language for future generations.
