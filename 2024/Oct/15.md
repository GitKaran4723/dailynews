# India, Canada ‘expel’ diplomats as Nijjar case row intensifies

In a significant diplomatic escalation, India on Monday withdrew its **High Commissioner Sanjay Kumar Verma** and other senior diplomats from **Canada**. This move comes amid growing tensions between the two countries, following accusations by Canadian Prime Minister **Justin Trudeau** linking Indian government agents to the killing of **Hardeep Singh Nijjar**, a Canadian Sikh separatist leader, in British Columbia in June 2023. India has vehemently denied the allegations and called them baseless.

Following this withdrawal, India expelled **six Canadian diplomats**, including the chargé d'affaires **Stewart Ross Wheeler**. This is seen as a tit-for-tat response to Canada's earlier decision to expel an Indian diplomat.

The tensions between India and Canada have strained diplomatic relations, with both countries accusing the other of meddling in internal affairs. Canada’s concerns center on allegations of foreign interference, while India has expressed frustration over what it sees as leniency toward **Khalistan separatists** operating within Canadian borders. These groups advocate for an independent Sikh state, **Khalistan**, and India views them as a threat to its national security.

This diplomatic standoff risks further damaging trade and bilateral relations between the two nations. Canada is home to a large **Sikh diaspora**, some of whom support the Khalistan movement, a point of contention in India-Canada ties.

Both governments have called for a peaceful resolution, but the latest actions signal that the situation may worsen before it improves. Many are closely watching how these developments will unfold and impact the broader geopolitical landscape.

**India-Canada relations** have historically been based on shared democratic values, trade ties, and people-to-people connections, largely driven by Canada's significant **Indian diaspora**, particularly the Sikh community. However, in recent years, relations have become strained due to several factors.

### Key Aspects of India-Canada Relations:

1. **Economic Ties**: 
   India and Canada share strong trade relations, with both countries being part of the **Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA)** negotiations. Trade between the two nations has grown, with Canada exporting goods like pulses and importing pharmaceuticals and IT services from India. In 2022, bilateral trade in goods and services was valued at approximately $12 billion.

2. **People-to-People Ties**:
   Canada is home to a large Indian diaspora, numbering about **1.8 million** people, which strengthens bilateral relations. The Sikh community is particularly prominent in Canadian politics and society, including figures like **Jagmeet Singh**, leader of Canada's New Democratic Party (NDP). This diaspora plays a vital role in fostering connections through education, culture, and business.

3. **Diplomatic Tensions**:
   Recent relations have been strained due to growing concerns over **Khalistan separatism** in Canada. India has long accused Canada of allowing pro-Khalistan groups, which advocate for an independent Sikh state, to operate within its borders. The situation escalated in 2023 when Canadian Prime Minister **Justin Trudeau** alleged that Indian agents were involved in the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Canadian Sikh separatist leader, which India has denied. In response, both countries have expelled diplomats, further straining ties.

4. **Security and Strategic Cooperation**:
   Despite tensions, both countries have worked together on global issues such as climate change and counter-terrorism. Canada supports India's role in international institutions like the **United Nations Security Council** and **G20**, while India values Canada's voice in multilateral forums.

### Current Challenges:
- **Allegations of Foreign Interference**: Trudeau's allegations against India concerning the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar have exacerbated tensions. India's response, accusing Canada of harboring **Khalistan separatists**, has brought relations to a critical juncture.
- **Diplomatic Fallout**: The reciprocal expulsion of diplomats by both countries in 2023 marked one of the most severe deteriorations in bilateral ties.

### Outlook:
While India-Canada relations remain under pressure due to diplomatic and security concerns, both countries benefit from their economic ties and the strong Indian diaspora in Canada. Resolving the ongoing diplomatic disputes and managing the Khalistan issue will be key to restoring more stable relations in the future.

# Sept. inflation at 9-month high as food price surges

India’s **retail inflation** surged to a **nine-month high of 5.5%** in **September 2024**, marking an end to the brief two-month period where inflation was below the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) median target of 4%. This spike was largely driven by the resurgence of **food price inflation**, which jumped to **9.24%**, after remaining below 6% in July and August. The sharp rise in food prices, particularly of vegetables, pulses, and cereals, contributed significantly to the overall inflation rate.

### Key Drivers of the Inflation Surge:

1. **Food Inflation**: The most significant factor in the inflation spike was the resurgence in food prices. **Vegetable prices**, in particular, experienced a sharp increase due to supply disruptions caused by erratic monsoons. Additionally, the cost of **pulses** and **cereals** continued to rise, further contributing to food inflation.

2. **Erratic Monsoon**: The uneven monsoon has affected agricultural productivity, leading to reduced supply of key food items. The **deficit in rainfall** has had a ripple effect on crop output, particularly for vegetables, pulses, and cereals, which saw higher demand relative to supply, driving up prices.

3. **Global Factors**: External factors, such as rising **global commodity prices** and fluctuating crude oil prices, have also contributed to higher costs in transportation and logistics, exacerbating the inflationary pressures in the food and fuel sectors.

4. **Base Effect**: A relatively low base effect in the previous year has also contributed to the higher inflation readings. The comparative prices from the previous year were lower, amplifying the current year’s inflation calculations.

### Impact on the Economy:

The resurgence in inflation could have broader implications for **India’s economic recovery**. Rising inflation erodes consumer purchasing power, especially for low- and middle-income households, who spend a large proportion of their income on essential goods such as food. This could dampen domestic consumption, which is a critical driver of India's economic growth.

### Policy Response:

The rise in inflation is likely to prompt close scrutiny from the **Reserve Bank of India (RBI)**, which targets inflation within a **2% to 6%** band, with a median target of 4%. With inflation rising above the comfort level, there is growing speculation about possible monetary policy interventions. The RBI may face pressure to consider tightening monetary policy, such as raising interest rates, to curb inflationary pressures. However, any such move must balance the need to control inflation with supporting economic growth, which is still recovering from the aftereffects of the pandemic and global economic uncertainties.

### Outlook:

While inflation is expected to remain elevated in the short term, particularly due to food supply challenges and global price pressures, the government may take steps to stabilize prices through policy interventions, such as improving food supply chains and monitoring imports. Additionally, if monsoon conditions improve and food supply stabilizes, inflationary pressures might ease in the coming months.

In conclusion, the sharp rise in India’s retail inflation, driven by food price increases, presents a challenge to economic stability. Policymakers will need to closely monitor inflation trends and respond with a balanced approach that supports growth while keeping price pressures under control.

> India’s retail inflation surged to a **nine-month high of 5.5%** in **September 2024**, ending a two-month period below the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) target of 4%. The rise was largely driven by a sharp increase in **food prices**, which spiked to **9.24%**, especially in **vegetables, pulses, and cereals** due to supply disruptions from erratic monsoons. The inflation surge poses risks to household consumption and may prompt the RBI to consider tightening monetary policy. However, the central bank must balance controlling inflation with supporting economic growth amid global economic uncertainties.

# Taking guard

The **Reserve Bank of India’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)** recently decided, in a **5:1 majority verdict**, to maintain the benchmark **interest rate** at **6.50%**, a rate that has remained unchanged since April 2023. Despite the easing of inflation below the **RBI’s median target of 4%** in July and August, the committee deemed this trend temporary and slow-moving. One of the newly inducted external members on the committee advocated for a **25 basis point cut** in the interest rate, likely citing the brief decline in inflation.

However, the MPC's decision to maintain the current rate reflected concerns about future inflationary pressures. The central bank had predicted that inflation would rise again from September, driven primarily by food price increases. This prediction proved accurate as **September 2024** saw inflation spike to a **nine-month high of 5.5%**, reversing the earlier downward trend in inflation that had been seen in the preceding months. The **MPC** highlighted that this fluctuation in inflation is uneven, and further rate cuts could exacerbate inflationary risks.

The decision to hold rates is in line with the RBI’s cautious approach of managing inflation while supporting economic growth. By maintaining the policy rate at 6.50%, the RBI aims to keep inflation under control, especially amid uncertainties surrounding food supply disruptions and global economic pressures. 

The dissenting vote for a rate cut reflects the ongoing debate about balancing inflation control with the need to support economic growth. While inflation had been declining, the **MPC's** majority view reflects the concern that any premature easing of rates could lead to inflation re-accelerating, especially given the current global economic challenges and volatile food prices.

The **Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)** is a crucial body within the **Reserve Bank of India (RBI)** responsible for formulating the country’s monetary policy. It was established under the **RBI Act of 1934**, with the objective of achieving price stability while promoting economic growth. The committee's primary responsibility is to set the **benchmark interest rates**, particularly the **repo rate**, which influences inflation, money supply, and overall economic activity.

### Composition of the MPC:
The MPC consists of **six members**:
1. **Three members** from the RBI, including the **Governor** who serves as the chairperson, and two other officials from the RBI (typically the Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy and one more member of the central bank).
2. **Three external members** are appointed by the **Government of India** for a four-year term. These external members are usually experts in the fields of economics, banking, or finance.

Decisions within the MPC are taken by **majority vote**, and in the case of a tie, the RBI Governor has the casting vote.

### Key Responsibilities:
1. **Determining the Repo Rate**: The MPC sets the **repo rate**, the rate at which the RBI lends to commercial banks, which in turn influences interest rates across the economy. A lower repo rate stimulates economic growth by making loans cheaper, while a higher rate controls inflation by discouraging excessive borrowing and spending.
   
2. **Inflation Targeting**: Since the introduction of the **Inflation Targeting Framework** in 2016, the MPC has been mandated to maintain inflation within a target range of **4%** (with a tolerance band of ±2%). The primary goal is to ensure price stability, which is essential for sustainable economic growth.

3. **Policy Announcements**: The MPC meets **bi-monthly** (every two months) to review the economy and decide on the appropriate monetary policy stance. The committee considers a wide range of factors, including inflation data, economic growth indicators, global economic trends, and fiscal policies.

### Decision-Making Process:
The MPC meets for three days before announcing its decision on the **repo rate** and other monetary policy measures. The decision is based on majority voting, and each member’s vote is recorded. After every meeting, the RBI releases the **Monetary Policy Report**, detailing the committee’s stance, rationale for decisions, and an inflation outlook.

### Key Objectives:
1. **Price Stability**: The primary goal of the MPC is to keep inflation within the target range. Price stability ensures predictability in the economy, which fosters investment and consumption.
   
2. **Economic Growth**: Along with controlling inflation, the MPC is also tasked with promoting economic growth by maintaining a balanced monetary policy that supports credit flow and investment.

3. **Financial Stability**: The MPC’s actions indirectly contribute to maintaining stability in the financial system by ensuring that inflation does not spiral out of control, which could undermine economic stability.

### Importance of the MPC:
- **Inflation Control**: The MPC plays a critical role in keeping inflation in check, which directly impacts the purchasing power of consumers.
- **Monetary Policy Transparency**: By making the process transparent and including external members, the MPC aims to provide a balanced and data-driven approach to monetary policy.
- **Accountability**: The MPC is accountable to the public and Parliament, with its actions and minutes being made public after every meeting, thus enhancing transparency in economic governance.

### Recent Developments:
In recent years, the MPC has faced challenges related to global inflationary pressures, economic disruptions due to the **COVID-19 pandemic**, and fluctuating food prices. The committee has worked to balance inflation control with supporting economic recovery during these difficult times.

In conclusion, the **Monetary Policy Committee** is a critical institution in India’s monetary governance, ensuring that the country’s monetary policy supports both inflation control and economic growth. Its decisions influence interest rates, inflation levels, and overall financial stability.

> The **Reserve Bank of India’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)**, in a **5:1 majority decision**, held the benchmark interest rate steady at **6.50%**, where it has remained since April 2023. While one external member advocated for a **25 basis point rate cut**, citing lower inflation in July and August, the MPC viewed the recent moderation as slow and uneven. The committee anticipated a rise in inflation from **September 2024**, which indeed occurred, with inflation hitting a **nine-month high of 5.5%**. The decision reflects the RBI’s cautious approach to managing inflation risks while supporting economic stability.

# A blueprint for safeguarding children

On **September 23, 2024**, the **Supreme Court of India** made a landmark ruling to combat **Child Sexual Exploitative and Abuse Material (CSEAM)**, correcting a significant oversight in the existing legal framework. The Court expanded the scope of the crime by declaring that not only the creation but also the **downloading and storage** of CSEAM would be considered a criminal offense. This marked a pivotal shift in the understanding of how such material contributes to a dangerous **demand-supply chain** that fuels the exploitation of children.

The decision reframed the issue by moving away from the term "child pornography" to **CSEAM**, emphasizing that this is not merely adult entertainment but a heinous crime involving the **rape and exploitation** of children. This linguistic shift underscores the severity of the crime and its long-term impact on victims.

In addition to addressing the crime itself, the Supreme Court laid out a **comprehensive framework** for preventing the distribution and consumption of CSEAM. One of the key aspects of the ruling was the mandate for **social media intermediaries** to strictly comply with Indian laws on this matter. The Court placed the responsibility on these platforms to actively monitor and prevent the circulation of such material, ensuring that their systems are robust enough to detect and block CSEAM content.

The Court also called for greater coordination between law enforcement agencies, social media companies, and internet service providers to create a strong **digital infrastructure** to prevent the spread of CSEAM. This includes better tracking of users searching for such material, as individuals engaging in this behavior are seen as contributing to the victimization of children by perpetuating the demand for such content.

In its ruling, the Supreme Court also stressed the importance of **rehabilitating victims** of child sexual abuse. It urged for stronger victim support mechanisms, including psychological counseling and legal assistance, recognizing the lifelong trauma experienced by survivors of such crimes.

This judgment is a significant step forward in **India’s fight against child sexual abuse** and exploitation. It brings clarity to the criminalization of possession and storage of CSEAM and reaffirms the need for a comprehensive national strategy to address this growing issue. Furthermore, by holding social media platforms accountable, the Court has highlighted the need for proactive digital governance and the importance of maintaining online spaces free from exploitation.

This decision is expected to lead to stricter enforcement of existing laws and possibly the introduction of new legislation aimed at combating the production, distribution, and consumption of CSEAM. It signals a clear message that child exploitation, in any form, will not be tolerated and that every participant in the chain, from producers to consumers, will be held accountable for their role in perpetuating these heinous acts.

### Measures required

While this mandate is a significant victory, it is just the beginning. To fully realise its impact, the government must implement a comprehensive set of measures to ensure the safety and rehabilitation of children. Current approaches largely focus on punishing those in possession of CSEAM, while the child victims behind these images often remain without support. A globally coordinated, preventive, and protective framework is urgently needed — one that not only targets offenders, but also addresses the ecosystem and the evolving nature of child exploitation.

**First**, cybercrime should be explicitly defined in Indian laws and CSEAM should be brought within its ambit as an economic and organised crime. Emerging crimes, such as enticement through electronic or digital means, and the resulting trafficking for both forced labour and sexual exploitation need to be explicitly outlawed. The rise of AI-generated child sexual abuse material makes the situation worse as it blurs the line between real and synthetic images, making it difficult for authorities to deliver justice. Legal amendments are required to treat the creation of CSEAM, including AI-generated deep fakes, as equivalent to real child abuse. Without swift action, AI-driven exploitation will pose an even greater threat to children.

**Second**, social media platforms must be held accountable for reporting CSEAM in real-time to law enforcement. The judgment has mandated that intermediaries report such content to local police and authorities.

**Third**, India should establish an institutional framework in the form of a forensic lab equipped with cutting-edge technology to respond to the increase in reporting of CSEAM by intermediaries and social media companies. Currently, international agencies, such as Interpol, flag Indian IP addresses to the National Crime Records Bureau, which then passes this information to state authorities. A domestic lab would reduce response time by allowing India to flag suspicious activity locally and share real-time alerts within Indian and foreign authorities.

**Fourth**, details of individuals prosecuted for searching or downloading CSEAM should be entered into the National Database on Sexual Offenders and barred from employment in sectors involving children.

### A border-less response

Most importantly, a border-less crime requires a border-less response. The United Nations Summit of the Future 2024 missed a critical opportunity to address emerging crimes against children. CSEAM is a multibillion-dollar global industry, accelerated by technological advancements. The world must unite to end this crime. To combat CSEAM effectively, we need a legally binding international convention.

By streamlining cooperation between law enforcement, governments, and stakeholders, we can enable targeted interventions to dismantle these networks and protect vulnerable children. Establishing an International Database of Sex Offenders could be a critical step in this direction. Financial institutions also play a crucial role in tracking and disrupting the money trails sustaining these networks. Without coordinated global action and financial accountability, dismantling these systems will remain elusive. Therefore, an international convention binding state and non-state actors is imperative to ensure coordinated response against the economics of this crime, and for identification of perpetrators, their networks, and for rehabilitation of child victims.

This is a watershed moment, offering a blueprint for how nations can take bold and decisive action to safeguard children. When fully implemented, it has the potential to not only transform India’s approach but also set a powerful global precedent in the fight against child exploitation.

> On **September 23, 2024**, the **Supreme Court of India** expanded the scope of crimes related to **Child Sexual Exploitative and Abuse Material (CSEAM)** by criminalizing the **downloading and storage** of such material. The Court's ruling reframed the issue, moving from "child porn" to **CSEAM**, emphasizing the gravity of the crime. The judgment mandated **social media intermediaries** to comply with Indian laws and block the circulation of CSEAM. It also called for a comprehensive framework to address the issue and stressed the importance of supporting victims of child sexual abuse through rehabilitation and counseling services.

# Ensuring a proper social safety net for the gig worker

The **Union Ministry of Labour and Employment** in India is in the process of drafting a national law to bring **gig workers** into the social security fold, marking a significant shift towards protecting these workers in an increasingly digital economy. The move is aimed at addressing the precarious employment conditions faced by gig workers, who often lack formal employment benefits such as health insurance, retirement savings, and other social security provisions.

### The Gig Economy and Social Security

The **gig economy**, which includes workers such as delivery personnel, ride-hailing drivers, freelance professionals, and other platform-based workers, has been growing rapidly in India. Companies like **Zomato**, **Uber**, **Swiggy**, and **Ola** have been key drivers of this trend. While these platforms offer flexible work opportunities, they do not provide traditional employment benefits, leaving workers without adequate protections.

In recognition of this, the government’s new initiative seeks to provide gig workers with **social security benefits**, including **health insurance** and **retirement savings**. This move would ensure that gig workers, who are often vulnerable to economic and health shocks due to the lack of a safety net, are integrated into the formal social security framework.

### Proposed Features of the Law

The proposed law aims to mandate platform-based companies or **aggregators** to contribute between **1%-2% of their revenue** towards a **social security fund**. This fund would be used to provide benefits such as:
1. **Health insurance**: Gig workers would have access to health insurance schemes, ensuring they are covered in the event of illness or injury.
2. **Retirement savings**: The law would also establish mechanisms for gig workers to save for retirement, providing them with financial security in their later years.
3. **Other benefits**: Additional provisions, such as maternity benefits, accident insurance, and disability coverage, may also be included in the scheme to ensure holistic coverage.

### Expanding Definitions

To ensure inclusivity, the Ministry is also working on **revising the definitions** of gig workers and **migrant workers** to better reflect the realities of employment in today’s economy. The current definitions may not fully encompass the variety of gig workers in different industries, including freelancers in sectors like tech, design, and content creation.

By broadening the scope of these definitions, the government aims to ensure that all individuals engaged in platform-based work or who migrate for work are entitled to these social security benefits. The move is a direct response to the growing number of workers who fall outside traditional employment categories but still face the need for social protection.

### Significance of the Law

This law is expected to be a major step forward in ensuring the welfare of gig workers. According to estimates, the gig economy in India could engage as much as **20%** of the workforce in the coming years, making it essential to offer protections to this large and growing segment of workers.

Furthermore, the introduction of this law is seen as part of the government's broader efforts to reform the labor sector, which includes consolidating various labor laws and focusing on worker welfare. The establishment of a **social security fund** and mandatory contributions from aggregators would mark a shift towards greater corporate responsibility and help create a more balanced and fair labor market.

### Challenges Ahead

While the law is a welcome step, its implementation may face challenges. Ensuring that gig workers across diverse platforms are adequately covered and that aggregators comply with the mandatory contributions will require robust monitoring and enforcement mechanisms. Additionally, questions remain about how benefits will be distributed and whether all gig workers, including freelancers, will be able to easily access these schemes.

In conclusion, the government's move to draft a national law for gig workers' social security is a significant development that could reshape the labor landscape in India, offering millions of workers much-needed protections while ensuring that the growing gig economy remains sustainable and fair.

> The **Union Ministry of Labour and Employment** is drafting a national law to extend **social security benefits** to **gig workers** in India. This law will mandate **aggregators** to contribute **1%-2% of their revenue** to a **social security fund**, which will provide gig workers with benefits such as **health insurance** and **retirement savings**. The government is also revising the definitions of gig and migrant workers to better align with current employment trends. This initiative aims to offer protections for the growing gig economy workforce, ensuring better welfare and financial security for these often vulnerable workers.
