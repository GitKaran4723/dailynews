# Chief Justice Chandrachud recommends Justice Sanjiv Khanna as successor

Chief Justice of India (CJI) D.Y. Chandrachud has formally recommended Justice Sanjiv Khanna for appointment as the 51st Chief Justice of India (CJI). Justice Khanna, currently a sitting judge of the Supreme Court, is set to succeed CJI Chandrachud, who will retire in November 2024. If the recommendation is accepted by the President of India, Justice Khanna will assume the role and lead the judiciary during a crucial phase, continuing the legacy of his predecessors in upholding constitutional values and ensuring justice for all citizens.

The appointment of the Chief Justice of India (CJI) is a significant event in the judicial system, given that the CJI is the head of the Indian judiciary and the Supreme Court of India. The process follows established conventions and protocols, ensuring that the highest judicial office is filled with someone of experience, legal expertise, and integrity. Below is a detailed explanation of the process, significance, and current context surrounding the appointment of a Chief Justice of India.

### **Constitutional Provisions for the Appointment of the Chief Justice of India**

The **Constitution of India** does not specifically lay out the procedure for the appointment of the Chief Justice. However, Article 124 of the Constitution, which deals with the appointment of Supreme Court judges, provides the framework for appointing the CJI as well. The CJI is appointed by the **President of India** under this article.

Over the years, the appointment of the CJI has evolved into a well-established convention known as the **seniority principle**, under which the senior-most judge of the Supreme Court is appointed as the Chief Justice.

### **Seniority Principle**

According to the seniority convention, the outgoing Chief Justice recommends the name of the senior-most Supreme Court judge as the next CJI. This practice ensures that there is no controversy or political interference in the appointment of the highest judicial officer. Seniority is based on the date of appointment to the Supreme Court and not the age of the judge.

Exceptions to this principle have been rare, but when they have occurred, they led to significant controversies. The most notable instance was during the 1970s when the seniority convention was bypassed under the Indira Gandhi government, leading to the **"Supersession Controversy"**. After this, the seniority rule has been consistently followed to maintain judicial independence.

### **The Process of Appointment**

1. **Recommendation by the Outgoing Chief Justice**: As the retirement date of the sitting CJI approaches, the CJI sends a formal recommendation to the Ministry of Law and Justice, nominating the senior-most judge of the Supreme Court for the position.

2. **Forwarding to the President**: The Law Ministry forwards the recommendation to the President of India for formal approval.

3. **Appointment by the President**: After receiving the recommendation, the President of India formally appoints the new Chief Justice. The new CJI then takes an oath of office before the President or someone authorized by the President.

4. **Oath of Office**: The newly appointed CJI takes an oath of office, swearing to uphold the Constitution of India, discharge duties faithfully, and serve impartially without fear or favor.

### **Roles and Responsibilities of the Chief Justice of India**

The CJI plays a vital role in ensuring the smooth functioning of the judiciary and is responsible for various administrative and judicial functions, including:

1. **Head of the Judiciary**: The CJI is the administrative head of the judiciary and the Supreme Court. This includes the allocation of cases and the constitution of benches that hear cases. The CJI ensures that justice is administered effectively and efficiently.

2. **Chairperson of the Collegium**: The CJI is the head of the **Collegium System**, which is responsible for recommending appointments and transfers of judges to the Supreme Court and the High Courts. The collegium consists of the CJI and four senior-most judges of the Supreme Court.

3. **Writ Jurisdiction**: As the head of the apex court, the CJI can preside over constitutional matters, including interpreting the Constitution, protecting fundamental rights, and adjudicating disputes between the Centre and the states.

4. **Advisory Role**: The President of India can seek the Supreme Court’s opinion on important legal matters through the CJI.

5. **Judicial Leadership**: The CJI's judgments and opinions influence the development of law and policy in the country. The CJI leads the Supreme Court, which has the power of judicial review, the authority to interpret laws, and the ability to ensure the constitutionality of government actions.

6. **Public Face of the Judiciary**: The CJI represents the judiciary in public forums and before other branches of the government, including the executive and legislature. The CJI also plays a key role in promoting judicial reforms, improving the functioning of the courts, and ensuring justice is accessible to all citizens.

### **Significance of the Appointment**

The appointment of the CJI is crucial due to the immense power and responsibilities vested in the position. The CJI has the final say on the composition of benches that hear important cases, such as constitutional matters, public interest litigations, and fundamental rights cases. The CJI also oversees the functioning of the judiciary and ensures that it remains independent and free from external influences.

Furthermore, the Chief Justice leads judicial reforms, addresses the issue of pendency of cases, and strengthens the judiciary’s ability to deliver timely justice. Given the complex nature of India’s legal system, the CJI's leadership is essential to ensuring that the judiciary remains a robust institution capable of upholding the Constitution and ensuring the rule of law.



### **Conclusion**

The appointment of the Chief Justice of India is a formal process rooted in seniority, constitutional traditions, and judicial independence. With the recommendation of Justice Sanjiv Khanna to become the 51st Chief Justice of India, the country’s legal landscape is set to continue evolving under his leadership. His judicial philosophy and experience are expected to shape the judiciary’s response to contemporary challenges while upholding the core values of the Indian Constitution.

> In October 2024, Chief Justice of India **D.Y. Chandrachud** recommended Justice **Sanjiv Khanna** for appointment as the 51st Chief Justice of India, following his impending retirement. Justice Khanna, one of the senior-most judges of the Supreme Court, is set to take over the office after CJI Chandrachud's tenure ends in November 2024.

Justice Sanjiv Khanna’s recommendation follows the established seniority convention. His elevation to the Supreme Court in January 2019 has been notable, and he has been part of various important rulings on constitutional law, human rights, and fundamental freedoms.

As the next Chief Justice of India, Justice Khanna will inherit a judiciary grappling with significant challenges, such as the pendency of cases, delays in justice delivery, and increasing demands for judicial transparency. His leadership will be key in guiding the Indian judiciary through ongoing reforms and ensuring that justice remains accessible to all citizens.

# Text of Vice-President's address at the Foundation Day Celebration of the National Human Rights Commission

This year the World Human Rights Day theme is Equality – Reducing inequalities and advancing human rights. Equality has to be understood as it is beyond definition as such. However at its core is that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and in rights.  Religion, race, colour, sex, status, or other facets are surficial. Discrimination in any form is challenging to core aspects of human rights.  Human rights are best secured and nurtured with public response. There can be no greater custodian of human rights than the public at large. We need to stand firm when such violations occur.

To respect others’ human rights is divine duty.  These rights are inviolable.  Preamble of our Constitution seeking justice, liberty, equality to all citizens is essence of human rights.  There is need to have fraternal feelings with respect for different perceptions and views.

Human rights can be defined in two ways. First is the narrow, legal way of defining human rights at the drop of a hat, we jump to it make a very small isolated instance systemic that's a legal way. The notion grants certain rights to individuals by their inherent being. No law is needed. We are born with human rights. We are born with basic rights, we are inalienable to humanity, inalienable to the individual and therefore, according to me, in all humility, we must see human rights from this prism that that is our way, that is the Indian way, that is the way we have lived for over 5,000 years. No country in the world can lay such a claim.

When we go into the evolution of these rights, they primarily started with political rights, including the right to life and liberty. There was a gradual accretion of other rights. Judiciary in this country has added many dimensions to these rights but there is another way, and that is the civilisational way of thinking about human rights. That is organicist way. It looks at human beings as part of an organic whole, including society and Prakriti or nature. And the system as a whole has to live in peace. It is encapsulated ‘Sarvam Shanti’. We have dictated our lives over centuries in spite of various difficulties by this dictum. For us as a nation nurturing of human rights is a way of life.

The civilizational way of thinking of rights did not evolve from political rights to economic rights and then adding other rights such as the freedom of conscious. The basic, the pristine, the organic, the original can be looked into our Vedas and our functioning over the ages, this defined sukha for all, well-being of all, happiness for all. This defines that we come to the planet as trustees, not as exploiters. We live not for us, but for all, we know for sure that we can be happy only with everyone being happy in as much as we have in togetherness to save this planet, because this existential challenge is not to an individual.

Our scriptures were and are our charters, they are repositories of knowledge and wisdom, they are repositories of the human way of life. One will have to strive for years to come to add to them. That is the ultimate when it comes to knowledge and these scriptures were loud, every day proclamation of these rights that society and the civilization granted.

Our civilization created institutions to ensure that these rights were honoured. In any governance in this country, at any point in time, those who governed had to listen to the voice of the people. Our sages, our seers, they were the real controllers of morality, property, and all that constitutes the welfare of humanity at large.

Our temples ran open kitchens so that there was freedom from hunger. Temples ran open kitchens so there was freedom from hunger. Education was free, so there was right to education. Friends, if you look at the Indian Constitution it has 22 paintings. The first one is the Gurukul, It defines our society is concerned that everyone would have access to education. You gave dakshina according to your ability, but there was no tuition fee. Guru dakshina if you got education, you can reward your teacher, you can honour your teacher but it did not have a compulsory element; it had an optional element. It had to emanate not from your fiduciary strength, but from the call of your soul that was the sublimity. We practised and are on our way to it. Everyone was allowed to practise their faith. Look at our country who came? They came, they were received, they were absorbed, they were in oneness, and they felt at home in this country in the same manner as they felt at home in other countries.

Expansion is the worst form of human rights transgression, this country has never believed in expansion has been a victim of expansion. The Prime Minister of this country has unequivocally stated on a global platform "We are not living in an era of expansion, we have to address issues and conflagrations by discussion and diplomacy." This is Bharat.

> In his address at the Foundation Day Celebration of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), Vice-President emphasized the significance of protecting human rights as fundamental to ensuring justice, equality, and dignity for all citizens. He highlighted NHRC's pivotal role in safeguarding the rights of vulnerable and marginalized groups in India. The Vice-President stressed the need for continuous efforts to address human rights violations and to uphold constitutional values. He called for stronger collaboration between government bodies, civil society, and the NHRC to promote inclusivity, social justice, and the well-being of all citizens in the evolving socio-political landscape.

# On the exception to marital rape

A three-judge Bench headed by **Chief Justice of India (CJI) D.Y. Chandrachud** has begun hearing a batch of petitions challenging the constitutional validity of Exception 2 to Section 375 of the **Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC)**. The challenge also extends, by implication, to Exception 2 of Section 63 of the **Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), 2023**, which supersedes the former provision. These provisions grant legal immunity to Indian husbands by stipulating that “sexual intercourse or acts by a man with his wife, provided she is not under 18 years of age, do not constitute rape”.

### What do statistics say?

While data on marital rape remains limited due to stigma and legal barriers, available statistics are deeply concerning. Data from the National Family Health Survey-5, conducted between 2019 and 2021, indicates that nearly one-third of married women (18-49 years) in India have experienced physical or sexual violence at the hands of their husbands. Additionally, global statistics reveal that approximately three-quarters of all sexual assaults transpire within intimate settings, often perpetrated by someone familiar to the survivor.

### What is the genesis of the exception?

The MRE is a colonial relic, originating from the “doctrine of coverture” in English common law, which severely curtailed a married woman’s legal autonomy. As elucidated by the Supreme Court in Joseph Shine versus Union of India in 2018, this doctrine assumed that the husband and wife became a single entity after marriage, that is, “the very being or legal existence of the woman is suspended during the marriage, or at least is incorporated and consolidated into that of the husband”.

One of the earliest instances of codification of the MRE can be traced back to British jurist Matthew Hale, who wrote in a 1736 treatise that “the husband cannot be guilty of a rape committed by himself upon his lawful wife, for by their mutual matrimonial consent and contract: the wife has given up herself in this kind unto her husband, which she cannot retract.” Hale’s reasoning proved hugely influential and was subsequently adopted by several British colonies. However, in 1991, England outlawed the MRE in the landmark case of R versus R underscoring that the common law doctrine no longer represented the true position of a wife in present-day society.

### What are challenges before the SC?

**Section 375 of the IPC** delineates seven conditions under which sexual intercourse is deemed rape, such as when it occurs without the woman’s consent, or when consent is obtained through coercion. Those convicted are punished with a prison term of at least 10 years, which can be extended to a life sentence, along with a possible fine. However, the provision stipulates two “exceptions”. The first exception pertains to medical procedures. As per the second exception, “sexual intercourse or sexual acts by a man with his own wife” do not constitute rape if the wife is over 18 years of age.

While the law initially granted immunity to husbands if their wives were under 15 years old, the Supreme Court revised this age limit to 18 years in Independent Thought versus Union of India (2017). The MRE, therefore, creates a legal fiction whereby, even if all the elements constituting the offence of rape are met, a conviction cannot take place if the parties are married and the wife is over 18 years of age. However, a married woman can seek recourse to other criminal law provisions such as Section 85 of the BNS which criminalises subjecting a woman to “cruelty”. Civil remedies can also be availed under laws such as the Protection of Women from **Domestic Violence Act (2005)** but they are limited to “protection orders, judicial separation and monetary compensation”. The petitioners have argued that the exception is unconstitutional since it violates a host of fundamental rights. Foremost among them is Article 14 which guarantees the equal protection of laws to all persons. The MRE creates two distinct classes of victims of non-consensual sex by denying married women the protection of laws that are extended to unmarried women. This, according to the petitioners, also offends the **principle of “substantive equality”** by failing to address systemic barriers to ensure that all women regardless of their marital status receive equal protection against sexual violence. By specifically disadvantaging married women, the MRE violates their right to non-discrimination under **Article 15(1)**.

Another important facet is the purported violation of the right to privacy and bodily integrity under **Article 21**. The Supreme Court’s ruling in **K.S. Puttaswamy versus Union of India (2017)** not only clarified that privacy was a fundamental right, it also affirmed the concept of decisional autonomy — the right of each individual to determine how and for what purposes their body may be used. As noted by constitutional law expert Gautam Bhatia the true brilliance of Puttaswamy lies in clearly establishing that the right to privacy is not merely anchored in physical spaces and institutions (such as marriage), but is fundamentally tied to individual self-determination. The right is, therefore, inseparable from the ability to make choices regarding the most integral aspects of one’s body and life. In Joseph Shine, the top court built on this jurisprudence by observing that “familial structures cannot be regarded as private spaces where constitutional rights are violated” and that doing so is “to obstruct the unfolding vision of the Constitution.”

### What are the judicial precedents?

In March 2022, the Karnataka High Court in **Hrishikesh Sahoo versus State of Karnataka** and Others ruled that a married man can be prosecuted for raping his wife. Relying on a 2013 report authored by the **Justice J.S. Verma Committee**, which recommended the abolition of the MRE, Justice M. Nagaprasanna reasoned that no legal exception can be so absolute as to licence crimes against society. However, instead of striking it down, he made the exemption inapplicable in cases involving the commission of heinous sexual offences by husbands against their wives.

The case stemmed from a 2017 complaint by a woman against her husband, Hrishikesh Sahoo, accusing him of committing multiple sexual offences. He was also charged with sexual assault under the **Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (POCSO)** for abusing their daughter. An appeal was subsequently filed challenging the High Court’s decision resulting in an interim stay being imposed by a Bench headed by former CJI N.V. Ramanna. In an affidavit filed before the top court, the Karnataka government, however, endorsed the High Court’s ruling.

In May 2022, the Delhi High Court rendered a split verdict on this issue. Justice Rajiv Shakdher deemed the MRE unconstitutional, asserting that it violates a woman’s bodily autonomy and expression. He characterised the exception as “steeped in patriarchy and misogyny,” adding that “the classification, in my opinion, is unreasonable and manifestly arbitrary as it implies that forced sex outside marriage constitutes ‘real rape,’ whereas the same act within marriage does not.” Conversely, Justice C. Hari Shankar opined that within marriage, sexual relations are a “legitimate expectation” making the MRE legal. “Introducing, into the marital relationship, the possibility of the husband being regarded as the wife’s rapist, if he has, on one or more occasions, sex with her without her consent would, in my view, be completely antithetical to the very institution of marriage, as understood in this country, both in fact and in law”, he reasoned.

Following this split verdict, the petitioners moved the Supreme Court, which clubbed together all petitions related to the MRE in January last year. While an authoritative pronouncement is awaited, the top court in 2022 recognised for the first time that “sexual assault by a man against his wife can constitute rape” in a separate case concerning an unmarried woman’s right to seek medical termination of pregnancy. A Bench led by Chief Justice Chandrachud underscored, “We would be remiss in not recognising that intimate partner violence is a reality and can take the form of rape. The misconception that strangers are exclusively or almost exclusively responsible for sex and gender-based violence is a deeply regrettable one”.

### What has the Centre stated?

The Union government’s latest Supreme Court affidavit is the first time that it has on record opposed the striking down of the MRE. During the proceedings before the Delhi High Court, the government had said that the “issue needs wider consultations” and that a review of existing criminal laws was pending at that time. Drawing from Justice Shankar’s opinion, the Centre has argued that marriage creates “a continuing expectation of reasonable sexual access” which is absent in the case of a stranger or of another intimate relationship. While acknowledging that a man has no fundamental right to violate his wife’s consent, it has contended that classifying such acts as “rape” is “excessively harsh” and “disproportionate”. It has also apprised the court that criminalising marital rape would affect the sanctity of the institution of marriage and potentially result in false allegations of marital rape.

### Would a ‘new’ offence be created?

A pivotal question before the top court is whether striking down the MRE would result in the creation of a new offence, as it would allow for the prosecution of husbands who engage in non-consensual sex with their wives. Justice Shankar, in his opinion, responded in the affirmative and cautioned that there is an “absolute proscription” against this since such an authority rests exclusively with the legislature. However, senior advocate Rebecca John argued before the Delhi High Court that deeming the exception unconstitutional would not create any new offence, as the offence already exists— rather, it would simply revoke the legal immunity presently enjoyed by a specific class of individuals. In Independent Thought, while raising the age for the application of the MRE from 15 to 18 years, the top court noted that “by partly striking down Section 375 IPC, no new offence is being created”.

> The exception to marital rape in India, under Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code, exempts husbands from being prosecuted for non-consensual sex with their wives, provided the wife is not a minor. This legal provision has been widely criticized for violating women’s rights to bodily autonomy and dignity. Critics argue that it perpetuates gender inequality and undermines consent within marriage. While several High Courts have addressed the issue, calling for the removal of this exception, the matter remains pending before the Supreme Court, sparking ongoing debates about marital rape, consent, and women's rights in the Indian legal system.

# India’s SDG focus and its human development issues

On September 9-10, 2023, New Delhi hosted the G-20 Summit, which resolved to accelerate the full and effective implementation of the UN Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development. On September 18-19, 2023, an “SDG Summit” was convened at the United Nations headquarters to follow up and review the implementation of the Agenda and the progress of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). A “Summit of the Future” took place on September 22-23, 2024, at the UN headquarters to build upon the SDG Summit 2023 and its commitments by member nations.

In this context, examining India’s progress in human development since 1990, based on the UNDP’s latest Human Development Report (HDR), is valid. As said by Nobel laureate Amartya Sen in his book, Development as Freedom, ‘development is a process of expanding the real freedoms that people enjoy’. In his ‘capability approach’, the basic concern of human development is ‘our capability to lead the kind of lives we have reason to value’. Freedom from hunger and ill-health on the one hand and gender and income equality, and access to quality education on the other hand lead to the achievement of human development, and, consequently, to sustainable development.

### Development and the SDGs

The Human Development Index (HDI) developed by the UNDP has three dimensions: long and healthy life (measured by life expectancy at birth); knowledge (expected years of schooling and mean years of schooling), and a decent standard of living (income per capita). All the three dimensions are much related to some of the key SDGs: SDG-3 (good health); SDG-4 (quality education); SDG-5 (gender equality); SDG-8 (decent work) and SDG-10 (reduced inequality). Clearly, countries aspiring to achieve sustainable development need to take appropriate measures to boost human development.

The HDR 2023-24 places India in the ‘medium human development category’ with a human development index (HDI) value of 0.644. India ranks 134 out of 193 countries. The HDI value was stagnant in 2019-20, at 0.638, and fell to 0.633 in 2021. It improved to 0.644 in 2022. In this report, some of India’s neighbouring countries have better HDI ranks — Malaysia (63); Thailand (66); China (75); Sri Lanka (78); Indonesia (112); Bhutan (125), and Bangladesh (129).

The HDR also presents interpolated consistent data which can be used to compare HDI values across years and countries. India saw its HDI value increase by 48.4%, from 0.434 in 1990 to 0.644 in 2022. As for HDI rankings, during 2015-2022, India improved by four ranks, while neighbouring countries such as Bangladesh and Bhutan improved by 12 and 10 ranks, respectively. China improved by 18 ranks. India’s human development initiatives lagged behind during 2015-22. One of the reasons for the slow growth is the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on dimensions of human development such as education and income.

### Gender gaps

The HDR also presents the Gender Development Index (GDI) for 193 countries. It measures disparities in human development by gender. The report contains HDI values estimated separately for women and men, the ratio of which is the GDI value. The closer the ratio is to one, the lesser the gap there is between women and men.

Among the 42 ‘medium human development countries’ to which India belongs, there are only seven with low equality in HDI achievements between women and men. These countries, with absolute deviation from gender parity of more than 10%, are India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Uganda, Morocco, the Syrian Arab Republic, and Kiribati.

India has one of the largest gender gaps in the Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR) a 47.8 percent points difference between women (28.3%) and men (76.1%). Female labour force participation rate in India is very low when compared to many countries, more so when one compares it with India’s neighbouring countries where in China it is 53.6 %, Bhutan 53.5 %, and Bangladesh 39.2%.

In the latest Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) -2022-23, published by the Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation, around 37% females of working age (15 years and above) were in the labour force in 2022-23; it was 23.3% in 2017-18. However, there is a huge gap in female labour force participation in rural and urban areas. While the female labour force participation rate in rural areas increased from 24.6% in 2017-18 to 41.5% in 2022-23, there is only a marginal increase in urban areas (from 20.4% to 25.4%). This is a matter of concern that requires further research and in-depth study aimed at feasible policy initiatives.

### Income inequality

In addition to the gender gap in income, inequality of incomes is also on the rise. India is one of the countries where income shares held by the richest 1% is very high (21.7%) compared to Bangladesh (11.6%), China (15.7%), Bhutan (18.1%), and Nepal (9.7%). Income inequality in India is also higher than the world average of 17.5% and the South Asia average of 19.6%. Most importantly, income inequality is also higher than other regional groups such as East Asia and the Pacific (16.5%) and Europe and Central Asia (15.7%).

India needs to address these gender development issues and increasing inequality in order to achieve the SDGs.

> India's focus on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aligns with addressing key human development challenges, including poverty, inequality, education, and health. While progress has been made in areas such as clean energy and sanitation, significant issues remain. High rates of malnutrition, child mortality, and inequality hinder human development, particularly in marginalized communities. Additionally, access to quality education and healthcare remains uneven. India's commitment to the SDGs requires sustained efforts in improving these sectors, with policies aimed at inclusive growth, reducing disparities, and ensuring environmental sustainability to enhance overall human development.

# A modified UBI policy may be more feasible

The concept of Universal Basic Income (UBI) has gained renewed attention globally, especially in the context of jobless growth, automation, and artificial intelligence (AI). As economies grow more productive due to technological advancements, job creation has failed to keep pace, raising concerns about income inequality and unemployment. A recent report by the International Labour Organization (ILO) highlights how this trend is affecting global job markets, with youth unemployment becoming a pressing issue, particularly in India. The idea of UBI, a guaranteed periodic payment to all citizens, is emerging as a possible solution to these challenges, forming part of a broader social safety net.

### Global Context and the Case for UBI

Automation and AI have significantly reshaped industries across the world. While these technologies have driven productivity and economic growth, they have also led to fewer traditional jobs being created. This "jobless growth" has resulted in rising inequality, as the benefits of economic development are not distributed evenly. High youth unemployment is a particular concern in many developing countries, including India, where the job market has struggled to absorb the growing number of educated young people. This has led policymakers and economists to explore UBI as a tool to combat unemployment and inequality.

UBI provides a guaranteed income to every citizen, regardless of employment status, ensuring that basic needs are met even in the absence of job opportunities. Proponents argue that UBI could address the problem of income insecurity in a world where jobs are increasingly scarce due to technological advancements. Moreover, it could act as a stabilizing force in economies experiencing rapid technological change by providing a financial cushion for those affected by job displacement.

### The UBI Debate in India

In India, the debate surrounding UBI has intensified over the past few years. The idea gained momentum after the 2016-17 **Economic Survey of India** proposed UBI as a potential policy measure to tackle poverty and unemployment. The Survey highlighted how existing welfare schemes in India, though numerous, often suffer from inefficiencies such as poor targeting, leakages, and corruption. UBI, with its universal coverage and direct cash transfers, was seen as a way to bypass these problems and provide direct income support to those in need.

A key argument in favor of UBI is that India’s investment in the **JAM (Jan-Dhan, Aadhaar, Mobile)** infrastructure makes the implementation of direct benefit transfers (DBTs) feasible. By leveraging this infrastructure, the government could transfer payments directly into beneficiaries’ bank accounts, minimizing inefficiencies and reducing administrative costs. This approach has been successfully employed in various welfare schemes, suggesting that the mechanism is already in place for UBI.

However, UBI’s implementation raises several important questions. First, there is the issue of cost. India is a large country with a substantial population, and providing every citizen with a basic income would require enormous financial resources. Critics argue that such a program could strain the country’s finances and lead to inflationary pressures if not managed carefully. Moreover, there is a debate about whether UBI should replace existing welfare schemes or complement them. Some argue that it could replace inefficient programs, while others believe that targeted schemes, particularly those aimed at vulnerable groups, should remain in place alongside UBI.

### UBI and Modifications for India

The concept of UBI in India may require significant modifications to make it more practical. A full-scale UBI may not be financially viable, but a **quasi-UBI** or **targeted UBI** could be an effective compromise. Instead of providing income to every citizen, the government could focus on specific vulnerable groups such as the poor, unemployed youth, or marginalized communities. This would allow for a more targeted approach, addressing the needs of those who require financial assistance the most while avoiding the huge fiscal burden of a universal scheme.

Another modification could involve introducing UBI gradually, beginning with specific regions or sectors that are particularly affected by unemployment or poverty. This phased approach would enable the government to test the policy’s effectiveness and iron out any implementation challenges before scaling it up to the national level.

something that is desirable may not be feasible from a budgetary point of view. Even if one were to agree that a UBI is indeed desirable as a social safety net policy, it may not be feasible given budgetary constraints. The real question is this: is a modified and less ambitious version of a UBI worth exploring?

In this context, some terminological confusion prevails. It might appear that some forms of a UBI already exist in India, such as cash transfer schemes for farmers and women. While these are cash transfer schemes, a UBI, by definition, must be universal, i.e., not targeted to any specific group. A comparison with other forms of safety net policies is fair, and indeed necessary. These could be policies that are targeted to specific demographic groups such as women or the elderly, or those that are contingent on certain socio-economic criteria being met (farmers, the unemployed, the poor), or those that are in-kind rather than cash (the Public Distribution System) or those that are conditional on being willing to work (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme or MGNREGS) or sending children to school (mid-day meals).

In recent years, India has already implemented income transfer schemes as part of its anti-poverty strategies, especially in the agriculture sector. In early 2018, Telangana launched the Rythu Bandhu Scheme (RBS), which gave farmers unconditional payments of ₹4,000 per acre. This approach was soon replicated at both the State level (the KALIA or Krushak Assistance for Livelihood and Income Augmentation programme in Odisha), and at the national level (the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana, or PM-KISAN). The PM-KISAN, of 2018-19, initially provided ₹6,000 per year to small landholding farmers, but was later expanded to cover all farmers, excluding income-taxpayers and those not engaged in farming. By 2020-21, the scheme aimed to cover around 10 crore farming households, with an estimated cost of ₹75,000 crore, roughly 0.4% of GDP.

### Benefits and Challenges of UBI

The primary benefit of UBI is that it provides a **safety net** for individuals, ensuring that they have enough income to meet their basic needs, even in the absence of formal employment. In a country like India, where poverty remains a significant issue, UBI could help reduce income inequality and improve the quality of life for millions of people. Additionally, UBI could empower individuals to pursue education or entrepreneurship without the immediate pressure of finding a job to survive, thus fostering long-term economic growth.

However, the challenges are considerable. Aside from the fiscal burden, there is the concern that UBI could reduce the incentive to work, leading to lower labor force participation rates. While this fear is often overstated, it remains a potential risk, particularly if UBI is set at a level that makes employment less attractive. Moreover, India’s complex socioeconomic structure means that a one-size-fits-all approach may not work, requiring careful planning and consultation with various stakeholders.

### Conclusion

The idea of UBI in India holds promise as a solution to growing inequality, unemployment, and poverty. However, its implementation requires careful consideration of the country’s financial capacity and the potential need for modifications. A targeted or phased UBI, leveraging existing infrastructure like JAM, could help address the challenges of jobless growth while ensuring that the most vulnerable populations are supported. While UBI may not be a silver bullet, it is certainly a concept worth exploring as part of India’s broader efforts to secure economic and social justice for all citizens.

> The concept of Universal Basic Income (UBI) is gaining renewed attention amid global concerns about jobless growth, automation, and rising inequality. In India, UBI was widely discussed after the 2016-17 Economic Survey suggested it could replace inefficient welfare schemes through direct cash transfers, leveraging India's JAM (Jan-Dhan, Aadhaar, Mobile) infrastructure. While UBI could provide financial security and reduce poverty, its high cost and potential impact on labor participation raise concerns. A phased or targeted approach, focusing on vulnerable groups, may be more feasible for India. UBI offers a possible solution to unemployment and inequality, but requires careful planning.

# SC upholds Section 6A of Citizenship Act as valid law

On Thursday, a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court of India, in a 4:1 majority decision, upheld the constitutionality of Section 6A of the Citizenship Act, 1955. This provision allows immigrants from Bangladesh, who have been residing in Assam, to acquire Indian citizenship under specific conditions. The ruling has significant implications for both legal and political landscapes, particularly concerning Assam, a northeastern state that has witnessed considerable immigration from Bangladesh since the early 20th century.

### Background of Section 6A

Section 6A was introduced into the Citizenship Act in 1985 following the **Assam Accord**, an agreement between the Government of India and the leaders of Assam to address the sensitive issue of illegal immigration from Bangladesh (formerly East Pakistan). This section grants citizenship to immigrants from Bangladesh who entered Assam before March 25, 1971. The provision distinguishes between immigrants who arrived before this date and those who arrived after, the latter being classified as illegal immigrants subject to deportation.

The Assam Accord was a response to the widespread anti-immigrant agitation that took place in Assam during the late 1970s and early 1980s. The movement, led by the All Assam Students' Union (AASU), demanded the detection and deportation of illegal immigrants. Section 6A sought to balance the interests of Assam’s native population with humanitarian concerns for immigrants who had already settled in the region. However, it has remained a contentious provision, with critics arguing that it undermines the rights of Assam’s indigenous population and dilutes the state’s demographic and cultural identity.

### Supreme Court's Majority Judgment

In its 4:1 decision, the Supreme Court upheld Section 6A as a valid piece of legislation. The majority opinion argued that the provision aligns with the constitutional principles, particularly the preambular value of **fraternity**, which calls for the promotion of unity and harmony among all citizens, irrespective of their origins. The court emphasized that the Citizenship Act, as amended, is a legislative mechanism that addresses a unique historical context and should be seen through the lens of national integration and humanitarian concern.

The Bench noted that the decision to grant citizenship to immigrants who entered Assam before 1971 was a political compromise intended to settle decades of unrest. The court further held that the provision is consistent with the Constitution, which empowers the Parliament to regulate citizenship. It pointed out that the idea of fraternity, as outlined in the Preamble of the Constitution, requires the accommodation of diverse groups within the Indian Union and emphasized that Section 6A ensures the fair treatment of individuals who have resided in the country for decades.

### Dissenting Opinion

Justice Ajay Rastogi, the lone dissenter, raised concerns about the demographic and cultural impact of immigration on Assam. He argued that Section 6A potentially threatens the rights of indigenous Assamese communities and could lead to an imbalance in the state’s ethnic composition. He emphasized the need to protect Assam’s unique cultural and linguistic heritage, which has been under pressure due to the large influx of immigrants. According to his view, the provision risks alienating Assam’s native population and undermines their fundamental right to preserve their cultural identity.

### Implications of the Judgment

The Supreme Court's judgment has far-reaching consequences for Assam and the broader national discourse on immigration and citizenship. First, it upholds the legal framework established by the Assam Accord, ensuring that immigrants who entered Assam before 1971 can secure Indian citizenship. This decision is likely to be welcomed by those who advocate for a humanitarian approach to long-settled immigrants, many of whom have been residing in Assam for decades.

However, the ruling may exacerbate tensions within Assam, where indigenous groups have long opposed the presence of immigrants from Bangladesh. These groups fear that continued immigration will erode their cultural and linguistic identity and put additional pressure on the state’s limited resources. The dissenting opinion reflects these concerns, indicating that the court remains divided on the long-term consequences of Section 6A.

Politically, the ruling could have ramifications for Assam’s ongoing efforts to update the National Register of Citizens (NRC). The NRC is intended to identify illegal immigrants in the state, and the court’s endorsement of Section 6A reinforces the citizenship rights of those who entered before the 1971 cut-off date. However, it also raises questions about the status of those who arrived after this period.

### Conclusion

The Supreme Court's majority judgment upholding Section 6A of the Citizenship Act underscores the tension between humanitarian concerns and the protection of indigenous rights in Assam. By affirming the constitutionality of the provision, the court has sought to balance these competing interests, emphasizing the preambular value of fraternity. However, the dissenting opinion highlights the ongoing challenges of managing demographic change and protecting Assam’s cultural identity. The decision will likely have a lasting impact on Assam’s political landscape and its approach to citizenship and immigration.
