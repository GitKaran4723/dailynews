# Charity as a Selfless Act

Charity is deeply embedded in Indian culture and has long been seen as a moral and ethical responsibility rather than an act of self-promotion or a tool to influence others. In India, charity is guided by the principles of generosity, humility, and respect for the dignity of those in need. Rooted in ancient Indian philosophy and spiritual teachings, the concept of **“daan”** (charity) is viewed as a duty, an obligation, and an essential aspect of leading a fulfilled life. This approach emphasizes charity as an ethical responsibility, an act that transcends religious and social boundaries, reinforcing a spirit of compassion, inclusivity, and selflessness.

### Charity as a Selfless Act

In Indian culture, charity is often regarded as an act to be performed in silence, without expectation of acknowledgment or reward. The ancient scriptures, such as the **Bhagavad Gita** and the **Upanishads**, highlight the importance of giving selflessly. In the Bhagavad Gita, for instance, Lord Krishna speaks of “satvik daan,” or pure charity, which is given without expecting anything in return and with genuine concern for the well-being of the recipient. This type of giving is considered the highest form of charity and is highly revered in Indian culture.

Moreover, many Indian spiritual leaders and philosophers, including **Swami Vivekananda** and **Mahatma Gandhi**, have advocated for charity as a means of moral upliftment and personal growth. They believed that helping others is not only a duty but also a way to connect with one’s own inner self and contribute to the larger good of society. This view emphasizes that charity should be a quiet, sincere offering, devoid of self-interest and the desire for recognition.

### The Principle of “Daan” in Indian Society

The tradition of **daan** manifests in various forms in Indian society, from “anna daan” (donation of food) to “vidya daan” (donation of knowledge) and “vastra daan” (donation of clothing). These forms of charity aim to address basic human needs and to empower the less fortunate. In Indian villages and cities alike, it is common to see individuals and families regularly engage in acts of charity, from feeding the hungry to sponsoring education for children from impoverished backgrounds. The essence of daan is that it should be carried out with respect for the receiver, affirming their dignity and humanity rather than creating a sense of dependency or obligation.

### Charity as an Ethical Responsibility

For Indians, charity is more than an act of kindness; it is a moral responsibility rooted in **Karma** and **Dharma**. The belief is that performing good deeds, including charity, generates positive karma, which in turn contributes to one’s spiritual growth and well-being. Dharma, or righteous duty, encourages people to engage in selfless acts for the betterment of society. These beliefs drive individuals and communities to uphold charity as an ethical responsibility, one that reflects a sense of duty towards the marginalized and vulnerable, regardless of caste, creed, or religion.

### Relevance in Modern Times

In contemporary India, the ethical foundation of charity remains relevant, though challenges have emerged with the commercialization and politicization of charitable efforts. Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar recently emphasized that charity should be unconditional, cautioning against the practice of using charity as a means to influence the beliefs or faith of beneficiaries. His message reinforces the idea that charity should be free from strings or conditions, as imposing these can erode trust and distort the purpose of giving.

### Conclusion

In essence, charity in Indian culture represents an ethical responsibility that is inherently selfless and respectful of the recipient’s dignity. Rooted in age-old traditions, the Indian approach to charity promotes a society where individuals care for one another without expectations, fostering a sense of unity and inclusivity. By viewing charity as a duty rather than a display, India’s cultural ethos encourages giving that enriches the giver and receiver alike, ultimately contributing to a more compassionate and harmonious society.

> In Indian culture, charity, or "daan," is seen as a moral and ethical responsibility rooted in selflessness, humility, and respect for dignity. Guided by spiritual teachings, charity is viewed as a quiet duty, meant to be unconditional and free from expectation or influence over the recipient. Traditions like "anna daan" (food donation) and "vidya daan" (knowledge sharing) emphasize addressing fundamental needs. This approach reflects a commitment to compassion and inclusivity, as seen in Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar's recent remarks advocating charity without strings attached. India’s ethos promotes charity as a duty that strengthens community bonds and fosters harmony.

# Fair trade

As the 29th Conference of Parties (COP) approaches in Baku, Azerbaijan, India is intensifying efforts to advance its industry’s transition to carbon markets, a mechanism aimed at mitigating climate change. This COP session will focus on ramping up climate finance and refining guidelines for operationalizing carbon markets. Under the **Paris Climate Agreement** of 2015, Article 6 outlines a framework for these markets, allowing nations to trade credits generated from reducing or removing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, thus incentivizing climate action. These carbon markets serve as a financial mechanism encouraging nations and industries to adopt sustainable practices, shift to renewable energy sources, and conserve ecosystems that act as carbon sinks, such as forests.

### Understanding Article 6 of the Paris Agreement

**Article 6** of the Paris Agreement serves as a cornerstone for global carbon markets, dividing its provisions into key sections that structure how carbon credits can be generated, verified, and traded. These provisions encourage countries to achieve emission reductions either within their own borders or through international cooperation. 

Two essential mechanisms are specified under Article 6:

1. **Article 6.2** – This provision allows countries to enter bilateral or multilateral agreements to trade emissions reductions through a system of **Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes** (ITMOs). Here, if a country reduces emissions more than its targets, it can sell the surplus reductions to another nation that might be struggling to meet its climate commitments. This system is especially beneficial for developing countries, allowing them to monetize their emission reduction activities while promoting sustainable development projects.

2. **Article 6.4** – Known as the **Sustainable Development Mechanism (SDM)**, this provision establishes an international body that sets up a standardized, transparent procedure to certify emissions reductions. This mechanism is designed to create a reliable global market where private companies and governments can invest in verified emission reduction projects across the world. SDM is intended to be an improvement over the previous **Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)** under the Kyoto Protocol, with a stronger emphasis on sustainable development and integrity.

### How Carbon Markets Work

Carbon markets work by monetizing actions that reduce greenhouse gases, such as transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy, enhancing energy efficiency, or investing in carbon capture projects. Companies or governments undertaking such activities generate **carbon credits**, equivalent to one metric ton of carbon dioxide removed or prevented from being emitted. These credits can then be traded, allowing countries to “offset” their emissions by purchasing credits from countries that exceed their emission reduction targets.

This system is beneficial for both developed and developing nations. Developed countries that face higher costs of reducing emissions domestically can purchase carbon credits from developing countries where emission reduction activities are more cost-effective. In turn, developing countries receive much-needed funding for sustainable projects, from renewable energy installations to forest conservation.

### Implications for India

India, as a developing economy, has vast potential to become a major player in the carbon market by leveraging its renewable energy resources and expanding conservation efforts. The country is already advancing initiatives to meet its climate commitments, such as its ambitious **National Solar Mission** and afforestation efforts. Participation in global carbon markets can further encourage industries to invest in cleaner technologies and provide an economic boost to projects that conserve natural ecosystems.

India’s transition to carbon markets also aligns with its **Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)** under the Paris Agreement, where it has committed to reducing its emissions intensity and increasing its renewable energy capacity. Through carbon markets, Indian industries can achieve these targets while generating revenue by selling carbon credits on the international market.

While carbon markets came into existence nearly two decades ago, they have been plagued by opacity and criticism that they only created the illusion of emission reductions. Although such markets have revived, confusion remains about how credits may be verified. There is optimism that Baku may see a final resolution of this problem and that the first legal credits may begin to be claimed by countries next year. India, due to its voluntary commitment to generate half its electricity from non-fossil energy sources by 2030, stands to gain as a host of several carbon-reduction projects. Additionally, there are also mushrooming private sector enterprises in India setting up innovative forestry projects that reportedly lock carbon and can be claimed as credits by multinational companies, traded through so-called voluntary carbon markets. India’s iron and steel industries are among the nine types of industries expected to meet emission intensity standards by 2025. By restricting the amount of carbon per unit of production, this will, depending on regulatory enforcement, formally kick-start India’s carbon market. However, this will invite complex calculations and, given the experience of a related energy-efficiency trading scheme, run the risk of not exerting enough pressure on companies to comply. While calculating carbon saved is a fraught exercise, India must aim, through its research institutions and authorities, to evolve a transparent and fair policy that is on a par with the best internationally.

### Challenges and the Path Forward

While carbon markets offer numerous benefits, challenges remain. Ensuring accurate verification of emissions reductions, preventing double-counting, and avoiding loopholes that could allow companies to continue polluting without consequence are crucial issues. COP 29 aims to establish robust guidelines within Article 6 to address these concerns, creating a transparent, reliable framework for global carbon trading.

The renewed focus on carbon markets at COP 29 presents a unique opportunity for India to shape the global climate agenda. By participating actively, India can advance its environmental goals, support its industries’ transition to greener practices, and contribute to the broader goal of global climate stability. This approach would not only reinforce India's role as a responsible environmental leader but also promote sustainable economic growth within the country.

> Ahead of COP 29 in Baku, India is actively pursuing carbon market integration to support industry transitions to greener practices. The conference will focus on climate finance and operationalizing carbon markets under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. Article 6 enables trading of carbon credits generated by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, allowing countries to meet climate targets through mechanisms like ITMOs and the Sustainable Development Mechanism. For India, carbon markets represent both an environmental and economic opportunity, enabling it to fund sustainable projects and fulfill its emissions commitments. COP 29 aims to set clear guidelines for transparent, reliable carbon trading.

# Sharpen the anti-defection law, strengthen democracy

The anti-defection law in India, a crucial instrument designed to maintain the stability of governments and uphold the integrity of democratic institutions, has been a subject of much debate since its inception. Introduced in 1985, the law sought to address the rampant party-switching by legislators, which frequently led to political instability. While it has been somewhat effective in curbing the practice of defection, various loopholes and implementation issues have surfaced over time, necessitating further reforms.

### Historical genesis of the law

The problem of defection has deep roots in Indian politics, dating back to the post-Independence era. In the first few decades following Independence, India experienced a significant number of defections, which often resulted in the destabilisation of governments. This trend not only undermined the mandate of the electorate but also raised serious ethical questions about the conduct of elected representatives.

Legislators would switch parties, sometimes in exchange for financial gains or ministerial positions, leading to the fall of governments and the formation of new ones without fresh elections. This was colloquially referred to as “Aaya Ram, Gaya Ram”, a phrase that originated from an incident in Haryana in the 1960s, where a legislator, Gaya Lal, switched parties multiple times in a single day. Such incidents underscored the need for a law to curb this practice.

Indian Parliament enacted the anti-defection law through the 52nd Amendment to the Constitution, introducing the Tenth Schedule during Rajiv Gandhi’s tenure as Prime Minister. This law laid down the grounds for disqualification of Members of Parliament and State legislatures on the basis of defection. A member could be disqualified if they voluntarily gave up the membership of their political party or disobeyed the party whip in key votes such as confidence motions or Budget approvals. The law was aimed at providing stability to governments and ensuring that elected representatives remained loyal to the party’s mandate on which they were elected.

While the initial law provided some deterrence against defections, it still had loopholes. One significant flaw was the provision that allowed a split in a party if at least one-third of the members defected, which often led to mass defections. The 91st Amendment in 2003 addressed this issue by requiring that at least two-thirds of the members of a party must agree for a “merger” to avoid disqualification. This made it more challenging for small-scale defections to occur and reduced the incidence of such political manoeuvring.

Despite its intentions, the anti-defection law has faced criticism and challenges in its implementation. One of the most significant challenges is the inordinate delay in deciding defection cases. In some instances, Speakers have taken several months, or even years, to render a decision. This delay allows defectors to continue holding their positions, thereby subverting the purpose of the law. The discretionary power vested in the Speaker or Chairperson, without any stipulated time frame for decision-making, has often been a point of contention.

Another issue is the lack of transparency in the issuance and communication of party whips. Whips are essential instruments used by political parties to ensure discipline among their members, especially on crucial votes. However, the internal nature of these directives has led to disputes over whether members were adequately informed about the party’s stance, making it difficult to determine the legitimacy of defection cases. While the decisions of the Speaker or Chairperson are subject to judicial review, the courts have generally been reluctant to intervene in defection cases, citing the need to respect the autonomy of the legislature. This has limited the scope for addressing potential abuses of power or ensuring timely resolutions.

### Proposed amendments

To strengthen the anti-defection law and enhance its impartiality, two key amendments are proposed. The first concerns the time frame for decisions on defection cases. The absence of a fixed timeline for the Speaker or Chairperson to decide on defection cases has resulted in delays and potential misuse of discretionary power, undermining the law’s intent. To address this issue, a four-week time frame should be established for resolving defection cases. If a decision is not reached within this period, the defecting members should be deemed to be disqualified from their positions. This amendment to the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution would ensure timely resolutions, prevent arbitrary decisions, and uphold the legislative process’s integrity by limiting political bias and misuse of power.

The second is on public notice of party whips. The current lack of transparency in issuing party whips often leads to disputes over whether members were adequately informed. To resolve this, political parties should be provided with a framework of the service of the whip in the form of a newspaper publication or through electronic communication. In Keisham Meghachandra Singh vs The Hon’ble Speaker Manipur Legislative Assembly and Ors. (2020), the Supreme Court of India recommended replacing the Speaker’s role in anti-defection cases with an independent tribunal or a body appointed by the Election Commission of India. However, in a democracy, the importance of the Speaker or Chairperson’s office cannot be underestimated, as they are crucial in upholding parliamentary integrity and ensuring impartiality. Instead of sidelining this institution, reforms should aim to strengthen its accountability and transparency.

The Government of India must also explore various suggestions made by the Dinesh Goswami committee report (1990), the Hashim Abdul Halim committee report (1994), the 170th report of the Law Commission of India (1999), the Report of the National Commission to review the working of the Constitution of India (2002), the Hashim Abdul Halim committee report (2003) and the 255th report of the Law Commission of India (2015) for strengthening of the anti-defection law.

### Need for political will

The anti-defection law has, historically, played a crucial role in preventing instability caused by defections and maintaining the sanctity of the electoral mandate. However, its implementation has revealed certain gaps and challenges that need to be addressed to make the law more effective and impartial. The amendments to the Tenth Schedule of the Indian Constitution should be prioritised to facilitate the effective implementation of the Union Government’s “One Nation, One Election” initiative. By implementing these amendments, the anti-defection law can be revitalised to better serve its purpose in the current political context. It would ensure that elected representatives adhere to the principles of party loyalty and discipline while also protecting the democratic mandate of the electorate. Narendra Modi, the Leader of the House in the Lok Sabha, and Rahul Gandhi, the Leader of the Opposition, should take up the issue and ensure that the amendments are made to strengthen Indian democracy. In doing so, the law would continue to uphold the stability and the integrity of India’s parliamentary democracy, adapting to the evolving political landscape with greater efficacy and fairness.

> India’s Anti-Defection Law, enacted in 1985 and codified in the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution, aims to maintain political stability by preventing elected legislators from switching parties mid-term. It mandates disqualification for members who defect from their party or disobey party lines on key votes, preserving the integrity of electoral mandates and party loyalty. While it supports stability, critics argue it stifles democratic debate and individual choice within parties, as members risk losing their seats if they disagree with party policies. Balancing party cohesion with individual freedom remains a challenge for the law’s effectiveness in a democratic framework.

# The gap between the number of Nobel laureates from the United States and India 

The gap between the number of Nobel laureates from the United States and India can be attributed to various factors, including differences in **educational infrastructure, funding for research, institutional support**, and the **scale of scientific and academic ecosystems**. Here’s an overview of key reasons contributing to this disparity:

### 1. **Investment in Education and Research**
   - **United States:** The U.S. invests heavily in research and development (R&D), with funding from government agencies like the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and National Science Foundation (NSF) alongside private sectors and philanthropic organizations. This allows for substantial research opportunities across fields. Universities like Harvard, MIT, and Stanford receive high levels of funding, allowing them to attract top researchers and sustain cutting-edge research projects.
   - **India:** Although India has increased its investment in education and research, the overall funding remains relatively low compared to the U.S. Limited resources can hinder large-scale research initiatives, and high-potential scientists often migrate to countries with better facilities and funding, creating a “brain drain.”

### 2. **Research Ecosystem and Collaboration**
   - **United States:** The U.S. boasts a collaborative and interdisciplinary research culture, where academia, industry, and government work closely. Institutions often form networks with global universities and researchers, leading to a higher quality of research output. This openness to international collaboration helps scientists in the U.S. contribute to groundbreaking work recognized globally.
   - **India:** Although India has prestigious institutions like the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), Indian Institute of Science (IISc), and several research councils, collaboration across disciplines and with international partners can be limited. Bureaucratic challenges and restrictive policies may hinder the smooth flow of collaborative, interdisciplinary research.

### 3. **Educational System and Research Focus**
   - **United States:** The American education system places emphasis on creativity, innovation, and critical thinking from an early stage. Students are encouraged to pursue unique ideas and often have access to resources and mentors who can guide high-level research. Moreover, research is a core component of higher education in the U.S., and universities have structured programs that encourage doctoral and post-doctoral research.
   - **India:** The Indian educational system has traditionally focused on examinations and rote learning, though this is gradually changing. Emphasis on foundational research is less compared to job-oriented studies, and research in many fields may lack the robust mentoring and support structures necessary for international impact.

### 4. **Recognition and Awards Culture**
   - **United States:** In the U.S., the culture of recognizing and awarding scientific breakthroughs, whether through the Nobel Prize, national honors, or prestigious fellowships, motivates researchers. Success is celebrated, which in turn attracts talent and fosters a sense of achievement and encouragement.
   - **India:** In India, recognition for research contributions can sometimes be limited, and the public awareness of Nobel-caliber scientific contributions is relatively low. This may impact the level of support and enthusiasm for scientific research and deter some young scientists from pursuing careers in research.

### 5. **Brain Drain**
   - Many Indian researchers and scientists have made significant contributions to Nobel-winning work after relocating to other countries, particularly the U.S. The appeal of better funding, facilities, and career prospects abroad results in talented Indian scientists achieving their potential in international institutions rather than domestically.

As of 2023, the **United States** has produced approximately **400 Nobel laureates** across various categories, making it the country with the highest number of Nobel Prize recipients. The U.S. has excelled in fields like **Physics, Chemistry, Medicine, Literature, Peace**, and **Economic Sciences**.

**India** has had **12 Nobel laureates** officially recognized as Indian citizens or for work associated with India, across the categories of **Literature, Peace, Physics, Medicine, and Economic Sciences**. Notable laureates include **Rabindranath Tagore (Literature, 1913)**, **C.V. Raman (Physics, 1930)**, and **Amartya Sen (Economics, 1998)**. Many Indian-origin scientists have also won the prize while working abroad.

### Conclusion
The gap between U.S. and Indian Nobel laureates is the result of combined factors involving differences in funding, research ecosystems, educational priorities, and global opportunities. While India has made strides in building its research infrastructure and reversing brain drain, continued investment and policy support are crucial for fostering an environment where groundbreaking research can thrive and be recognized globally.

> The gap between Nobel laureates from the U.S. and India stems from differences in research funding, infrastructure, education, and support systems. The U.S. invests heavily in research and development, fostering collaboration among academia, industry, and government. Its education system emphasizes creativity and innovation, with strong institutional backing for research. India, though advancing, faces challenges with limited funding, a traditionally exam-focused education system, and bureaucratic hurdles in research. Additionally, many Indian scientists move abroad to pursue opportunities, contributing to brain drain. For India to close this gap, sustained investment in research and supportive policies are essential to nurture Nobel-caliber work.

# A farewell, a death, and a political row

The tragic incident involving Additional District Magistrate (ADM) Naveen Babu’s death in Kannur, Kerala, on October 15, 2024, following alleged public humiliation by Panchayat President P.P. Divya, highlights the critical importance of mental health and professional decorum in civil service roles. Naveen Babu reportedly died by suicide after Divya accused him of corruption and publicly questioned his integrity during a farewell event, which she attended without an invitation. This accusation involved alleged delays and a supposed bribe associated with issuing a No Objection Certificate (NOC) for a petrol pump.

For civil servants and those preparing for such roles, this case brings forward several lessons:

### 1. **The Importance of Resilience and Mental Health Support:**
   - Civil servants often face immense pressure from various stakeholders, and public accusations can take a significant emotional toll. This incident underscores the need for mental health support mechanisms within the civil service framework, helping officials manage stress and build resilience.
   - Learning to navigate public scrutiny and allegations professionally while seeking support from peers or counselors could be essential for maintaining mental well-being.

### 2. **Maintaining Professional Boundaries and Decorum:**
   - The fallout between ADM Babu and Divya points to the importance of respectful and constructive communication in public service. Leaders and officials must communicate concerns professionally, respecting the dignity of all individuals involved.
   - Constructive criticism, when necessary, should be communicated privately, with an opportunity for clarification, rather than in public forums where it could lead to unnecessary humiliation.

### 3. **Accountability and Transparency Mechanisms:**
   - While allegations of corruption are serious, it is equally important to follow due process and not assume guilt without an investigation. In cases like these, setting up a transparent mechanism for grievances and accountability, such as an inquiry or audit, is critical.
   - This approach would ensure that any accusations are handled systematically, avoiding unnecessary damage to personal reputation and professional morale.

### 4. **Emotional Intelligence and Empathy in Leadership:**
   - Leaders in public service are often role models, and displaying empathy and understanding can help build a supportive work environment. By recognizing the pressures civil servants face, superiors and colleagues can foster a culture of mutual respect and moral support.

For civil servants, this incident underscores the importance of maintaining professionalism under political pressure, handling allegations effectively, and recognizing the significance of mental well-being. As public servants often face public scrutiny and stress, it is crucial to establish stronger support systems within administrative frameworks, including access to mental health resources and structured responses to handle unfounded accusations.

ADM Babu’s death also highlights the need for a respectful, empathetic work culture that allows civil servants to address challenges without fear of undue public humiliation. Civil servants, by adhering to protocols, exercising transparency, and fostering open communication with colleagues and superiors, can mitigate risks associated with stressful situations. This case emphasizes the importance of promoting mental health awareness and supportive networks within the civil services to help manage workplace pressures and personal challenges
This tragic incident calls for reforms in how public grievances and accusations are handled within administrative structures, emphasizing the importance of mental health resources, respectful communication, and adherence to due process to maintain the morale and well-being of public officials.

> The death of ADM Naveen Babu in Kannur, Kerala, allegedly by suicide after public accusations of corruption from Panchayat President P.P. Divya, emphasizes the need for mental health support and professional decorum in civil service. Divya’s public criticism at Babu’s farewell reportedly caused distress, sparking protests and calls for accountability. This incident underscores the importance of maintaining respectful communication, handling allegations through formal procedures, and fostering mental health resilience among civil servants to manage the pressures of public scrutiny. Strengthening these areas could help prevent similar tragedies in the future.

# Army reassessing strategy to tackle terrorism in Kashmir

The Indian Army is reassessing its counter-terrorism strategy in Jammu and Kashmir to tackle emerging threats effectively, especially with evolving tactics by terrorist groups, increased use of sophisticated technology, and changing geopolitical dynamics. The aim is to minimize terrorist infiltration, control local radicalization, and curb the operational capacity of terrorist groups. Here’s a breakdown of the key strategic changes that could be implemented:

### 1. **Enhanced Surveillance and Intelligence Gathering**
   - **Technological Surveillance**: The Army may increase its reliance on advanced surveillance systems, including **drones, thermal imaging cameras, and satellite technology**. This equipment helps in real-time monitoring of the Line of Control (LoC) and critical zones within Kashmir, detecting movement and identifying possible infiltration routes.
   - **Data-Driven Intelligence**: Integrating intelligence gathered by local agencies, such as the police and intelligence units, is essential for a proactive strategy. A centralized data system could aid in identifying patterns in terrorist activity, including recruitment hubs, frequently used infiltration routes, and logistical networks.

### 2. **Localized Anti-Terror Operations**
   - **Intensified Counter-Infiltration Measures**: Given the porous LoC, an increased deployment of special forces trained in **high-altitude and guerrilla warfare** could help in swiftly neutralizing terrorists attempting to cross over. Combining **specialized units like the National Security Guard (NSG)** and **Rashtriya Rifles (RR)** with local intelligence will enhance rapid-response capabilities.
   - **Targeted Operations**: Army operations will need to focus on specific areas with known terrorist activity rather than large-scale combing operations, which often have limited success. This involves precision-based targeting, enabled by actionable intelligence, to minimize civilian disruptions and maximize effectiveness.

### 3. **Community Engagement and Local Support**
   - **Winning Hearts and Minds**: Building trust with local populations is crucial. Initiatives that improve public welfare, such as medical camps, educational programs, and vocational training, foster goodwill and weaken the support base for terrorist elements.
   - **Youth Outreach Programs**: Engaging youth is key to countering radicalization. Programs aimed at skill development, sports, and education can provide constructive outlets for young people who might otherwise be vulnerable to extremist propaganda. Collaboration with civil society and local leaders could strengthen these efforts.

### 4. **Use of Technology to Counter Propaganda and Radicalization**
   - **Cyber Surveillance**: Many terrorist groups are using social media and online platforms to recruit and spread propaganda. Monitoring and countering these digital threats through a coordinated approach with **cybersecurity agencies** and **local law enforcement** can prevent online radicalization and the spread of inflammatory content.
   - **Counter-Messaging**: Developing a digital strategy to counter terrorist narratives and promote positive messages about peace and development in Kashmir is vital. Working with influencers and local stakeholders to disseminate these messages can help change public perception.

### 5. **Inter-Agency Coordination**
   - **Unified Command Structure**: The involvement of multiple agencies, such as the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Intelligence Bureau (IB), and Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), is essential for cohesive operations. Establishing an integrated command center for the coordinated planning and execution of anti-terrorism operations can enhance the effectiveness and reduce overlaps.
   - **Enhanced Cross-Border Surveillance**: Collaborative efforts with other nations, especially focusing on **cross-border intelligence-sharing** with neighboring countries, can help intercept support networks for terrorists and prevent them from gaining operational ground.

### 6. **Continuous Training and Adaptation**
   - Terrorist tactics in Kashmir have become more sophisticated, requiring constant training and equipment upgrades for security forces. Enhanced focus on **urban warfare training**, familiarity with **modern combat technology**, and continuous tactical adaptation are essential to maintaining an advantage.

In conclusion, a multipronged approach that includes advanced technology, localized intelligence, community engagement, cyber vigilance, and inter-agency collaboration is crucial for an effective counter-terrorism strategy in Kashmir. The reassessment of tactics reflects the Army’s commitment to adapting to new challenges, aiming for a secure, stable region that can move towards peace and development while countering terrorism at its roots.

Countering radicalization in Kashmir requires a multi-pronged, community-centered approach focused on addressing root causes, promoting education and economic opportunities, strengthening community trust, and countering extremist narratives. Here are several strategies that can help:

### 1. **Community Engagement and Building Trust**
   - **Strengthen local governance and community programs**: Collaborating with local leaders, religious figures, and community organizations to create programs that address community needs, such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure, helps build trust and discourages radicalization.
   - **Engagement with youth**: Given that young people are often targeted by extremist narratives, programs focused on sports, skill development, arts, and cultural activities provide alternative channels for expression and purpose. Programs like these encourage youth to stay engaged constructively within their communities.

### 2. **Promoting Education and Skill Development**
   - **Revamp educational programs**: A strong focus on quality education that includes courses on critical thinking, media literacy, and cultural awareness helps counter radicalized thinking. Schools and colleges in Kashmir should integrate courses that promote peace, tolerance, and pluralism.
   - **Skill-building and vocational training**: Providing skills training that leads to job opportunities creates pathways to financial independence and a positive future. Economic stability through employment can serve as a counter-narrative to extremist appeals, which often target disenfranchised youth.

### 3. **Psychosocial Support and Counseling**
   - **Mental health resources**: Many individuals exposed to traumatic events are more vulnerable to radicalization. Providing access to counseling and mental health support can help address grievances, feelings of alienation, and the trauma that extremist groups often exploit.
   - **Family support programs**: Educating families on recognizing early signs of radicalization and providing resources to support family members can be crucial. Families that are informed and supportive can act as a counterbalance to extremist influences.

### 4. **Counter-Narratives and Digital Literacy**
   - **Developing counter-narratives**: Extremist groups often use social media to disseminate radical ideologies. Promoting positive stories, real-life examples of peacebuilding, and testimonials from those who have rejected extremist ideologies can offer powerful counter-narratives. Collaborating with social media influencers, local journalists, and activists who resonate with Kashmiri youth can help spread these messages.
   - **Media and digital literacy programs**: Training youth to recognize and question propaganda helps in curbing online radicalization. Programs that enhance critical thinking and media literacy empower individuals to identify extremist messaging and question its motives and impacts.

### 5. **Economic Development and Job Opportunities**
   - **Investment in infrastructure and job creation**: Economic opportunities can provide youth with a sense of purpose and stability. Government and private investments in sectors such as tourism, agriculture, IT, and renewable energy can help create sustainable jobs in the region.
   - **Public-private partnerships**: Encouraging partnerships that invest in local businesses or tech startups can reduce economic grievances and provide alternative career options for youth.

### 6. **Enhanced Security and Intelligence Collaboration**
   - **Community policing initiatives**: Community-oriented policing, where security forces work with local leaders and residents to maintain peace, builds trust and cooperation, allowing security agencies to identify and address early signs of radicalization.
   - **Intelligence sharing and coordination**: Collaborating across agencies helps track and counter the movement and influence of extremist groups. Intelligence-based operations focused on radicalized networks can dismantle recruitment channels without creating community disruption.

In conclusion, countering radicalization in Kashmir requires an approach rooted in community engagement, economic empowerment, education, and trust-building, coupled with targeted security measures. By addressing the socioeconomic and psychological factors that fuel radicalization, Kashmir can work toward a peaceful and resilient society where extremist ideologies find little traction.

> The Indian Army is reassessing its counter-terrorism strategy in Kashmir to address emerging threats and evolving tactics.

# SC to examine plea to do away with ‘VIP treatment’ in temples

The Supreme Court of India recently agreed to examine a public interest petition challenging the practice of charging "VIP entry fees" and providing preferential treatment to specific individuals at temples. This issue was raised by petitioner Vijay Kishor Goswami, who argued that such practices create discrimination among devotees, including those who are elderly, children, disabled, or economically disadvantaged, who often wait in long queues while VIPs receive expedited access. The petition describes this phenomenon as fostering a "VIP culture" that privileges those who can pay for faster entry, contrasting with the egalitarian nature of religious practices intended to offer equal access to worship.

### Key Issues Raised

1. **Right to Equality and Worship**: 
   The plea argues that VIP treatment in temples violates the **right to equality (Article 14)** and the **freedom of religion (Article 25)** guaranteed by the Constitution of India. By allowing VIPs, who pay high fees, to bypass queues, the system creates an unjust barrier for those who cannot afford this service, thus limiting their right to worship freely. The petitioner claims that such preferential treatment contradicts the spirit of temples as places for all devotees, irrespective of socioeconomic status.

2. **Absence of Legal Definition for ‘VIP’**:
   A significant aspect raised during the hearing is the lack of a legal definition for the term "VIP." Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Sanjay Kumar pointed out that there is no statutory basis for categorizing individuals as "Very Important Persons" (VIPs) in religious contexts, which further complicates the justification for offering special privileges to certain individuals over others.

3. **Commercialization of Worship Spaces**:
   Charging for VIP entry turns places of worship into commercialized spaces, where only those who can afford additional fees enjoy a seamless experience. This, the petition argues, deviates from the purpose of temples as accessible and sacred spaces, accessible to everyone regardless of financial capability.

4. **Impact on Vulnerable Groups**:
   The petition emphasizes the disproportionate impact on vulnerable groups—senior citizens, women, children, and people with disabilities—who must wait for extended periods. The argument here is that the special treatment for VIPs not only undermines the dignity of these groups but also places them at a physical disadvantage, often requiring them to endure uncomfortable or even unsafe conditions while waiting.

### Judicial Intervention

The Supreme Court's decision to list the petition reflects the judiciary’s recognition of potential conflicts between commercial practices in religious institutions and constitutional principles of equality. The case has significant implications for religious governance, as it may lead to regulatory reforms to ensure equitable access to religious sites. The Court has, in the past, addressed issues related to temple entry, religious discrimination, and the commercialization of religious practices, but this case could set new precedents concerning accessibility to worship spaces.

### Broader Implications

If the Supreme Court ultimately rules against VIP privileges in temples, the decision may serve as a basis for revisiting similar practices in other public and religious spaces across India, promoting egalitarian access and reducing financial barriers in communal settings. Furthermore, this move may also influence the way religious institutions approach revenue generation, encouraging them to seek alternatives that do not infringe on worshippers' access rights.

### Conclusion

This case brings to the forefront the tensions between maintaining traditional, accessible religious spaces and modern practices that prioritize financial contributions. It emphasizes that religious institutions, especially in India’s diverse society, must operate inclusively to uphold constitutional principles. The petition's outcome could lead to reforms aimed at reinforcing the equality and dignity of every devotee, potentially altering the way Indian temples—and possibly other public institutions—manage entry privileges.

> The Supreme Court of India has agreed to review a petition challenging the practice of "VIP entry charges" in temples, which enables select individuals to bypass long queues by paying extra fees. Filed by Vijay Kishor Goswami, the petition argues that this “VIP culture” violates the constitutional rights to equality (Article 14) and freedom of worship (Article 25), as it disadvantages economically weaker devotees, including senior citizens, women, children, and people with disabilities. The Court noted that "VIP" lacks a legal definition, highlighting the need to reassess accessibility in religious spaces, aiming to ensure equal and dignified worship for all.
