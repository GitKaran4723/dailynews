# Can India escape middle-income trap?

The **World Development Report 2024**, published by the **World Bank**, sheds light on the economic challenge known as the **middle-income trap**. This phenomenon describes the slowdown of economic growth that many countries experience as they transition from low-income to middle-income status. According to the World Bank, middle-income economies are defined as those with per capita incomes ranging between **$1,136 and $13,845**. The report reveals that, over the past 34 years, only **34 middle-income economies** have successfully transitioned to high-income status.

### The Middle-Income Trap Explained
The middle-income trap occurs when countries achieve significant economic growth during the early stages of development but later struggle to sustain this momentum as they reach middle-income levels. As these countries' wages rise and their competitive advantage in cheap labor diminishes, they often face difficulties in shifting their economies towards more productive and high-value sectors, such as advanced manufacturing, technology, or services. As a result, growth stagnates, and countries find it challenging to move beyond middle-income status to become high-income economies.

The **World Development Report 2024** highlights a critical threshold: when economies reach per capita incomes that are about **11% of that of the United States**, growth rates typically slow down. This is a significant barrier, as countries need to adapt their economic models to continue growing at a pace that allows them to reach high-income levels.

### Factors Contributing to the Middle-Income Trap
The report identifies several key factors that contribute to the middle-income trap:
1. **Lack of Innovation and Technological Advancements**: Countries in the middle-income trap often struggle to invest in research and development, and they may lack the capacity to innovate. This limits their ability to move into more advanced and value-added industries.
2. **Weak Institutions**: Weak governance and inefficient public institutions can hinder economic progress. Corruption, bureaucratic inefficiencies, and lack of rule of law are barriers to sustained growth.
3. **Educational Gaps**: A shortage of a skilled and educated workforce can prevent economies from advancing into knowledge-based industries. Middle-income countries may struggle to offer the higher education and technical training necessary to build a modern economy.
4. **Infrastructure and Investment**: Insufficient investment in infrastructure, including transportation, energy, and digital connectivity, can limit economic opportunities and productivity growth.

### Transitioning to High-Income Status
The World Bank report notes that while many countries have made significant progress in reaching middle-income status, fewer have successfully completed the transition to high-income levels. Among the 34 economies that have managed this feat, those that have succeeded typically exhibit strong investments in human capital, innovation, and infrastructure. They also demonstrate the ability to build robust institutions that support growth.

Notable examples include **South Korea** and **Taiwan**, which invested heavily in technology, education, and infrastructure. These countries leveraged innovation and global trade to continue growing despite rising labor costs.

### Recommendations from the World Bank
To overcome the middle-income trap, the **World Development Report 2024** outlines several key strategies:
- **Diversification of the Economy**: Countries need to shift from reliance on low-cost manufacturing or natural resources to more diversified and advanced industries.
- **Investment in Human Capital**: A strong focus on education, skill development, and health is essential to create a workforce capable of supporting innovation-driven industries.
- **Strengthening Institutions**: Good governance, transparency, and efficient institutions are crucial for fostering an environment conducive to sustained economic growth.
- **Boosting Innovation**: Encouraging research and development, supporting startups, and integrating into global supply chains can help countries transition into more advanced sectors.

### Conclusion
The **middle-income trap** remains a significant challenge for many developing nations. While some countries have managed to break through and achieve high-income status, most struggle to adapt their economic models to sustain growth. The **World Development Report 2024** emphasizes the importance of innovation, strong institutions, and human capital development in overcoming this trap and achieving long-term prosperity. Without addressing these challenges, countries risk stagnating and missing the opportunity to join the ranks of high-income economies.

The WDR details the policies and strategies necessary to break out of the trap based on the development experiences of those countries that did manage the transition. It highlights the importance of the “3i” approach: investment, infusion, and innovation. Economies must invest, ensure the infusion of new global technologies, and develop an environment conducive to domestic innovation. This is no easy task and requires nimble and responsive state policy. In the modern economy, there are plenty of headwinds that India must overcome to successfully navigate the middle-income trap.

### Role of the state

Most countries that broke the trap were part of the European Union which facilitated growth and mobility of capital and labour for its members. Such institutions that aid free factor mobility are not available for most countries, for whom capital inflows are liberalised — largely flowing into their economies — with restrictions on the movement of labour. An important non-European country that managed to escape the trap is South Korea.

The South Korean state was heavily interventionist, often directing the private sector’s activities and ensuring their participation in an export-driven growth model. Successful companies were rewarded with access to new technologies and other supportive measures, while firms that did not perform were allowed to fail. This was no pure free market, but one where a powerful state intervened to bring about developmental goals, disciplining local elites and ensuring they followed the dictates of the state’s economic plan.

Another economy that broke the middle-income trap was Chile. But it too, saw state intervention in ensuring the success of natural resource exporting sectors. The salmon industry, for instance, succeeded in Chile due to the targeted intervention of the state on multiple fronts to ensure that the industry flourished.

The South Korean government’s approach carries significant lessons for India today. The state must be seen as being neutral amongst private players and ensuring those who do not make the mark are allowed to fail. The benefits firms receive from the state must be based on their performance instead of closeness to power. The presence of powerful business houses can promote growth provided they invest, ensure the adoption and infusion of new technologies, and innovate. South Korean business houses, or chaebols, are among the leaders in innovation today.

### Challenges facing India

The power of billionaires in the Indian economy has increased, and they are seen as being close to the state, with the state unable — or unwilling — to ensure high rates of investment from domestic capital. The manufacturing sector has stagnated, and there has been a reversal of the process of structural transformation, with employment increasing in agriculture and in low-productive forms following the pandemic.

The growth of the aggregate economy is not being reflected on the ground. While the government estimates a real GDP growth of around 7% in recent years, wages have not kept up. According to the PLFS, nominal wages for regular wage workers at the all-India level between April and June 2023-24 has only grown at around 5%, and that of casual workers at roughly 7%. With an inflation rate of roughly 5% during this time, this implies that wage earners have seen little to no real wage growth. An economy cannot break a middle-income trap if workers are unable to partake in the growth process, as reduced consumption demand will become a drag on the economy.

Most importantly, the question of democracy looms large. South Korea’s export strategy was overseen by a military government that ruled till the 1980s. The government frequently quelled labour unions to aid the accumulation process of capital. Chile deposed the democratically elected government of Salvador Allende by a military coup, installing General Augusto Pinochet as the head of state. It is vital not to take the wrong lessons from these countries, and think that democracy is an acceptable price to pay for higher growth. The challenge for policy is to promote state intervention to ensure growth while maintaining the sanctity of the democratic ethos.

> The **World Development Report 2024** by the **World Bank** highlights the **middle-income trap**, where economic growth slows as countries transition from low to middle income, preventing them from achieving high-income status. The report identifies that only 34 middle-income economies have moved to higher income levels in the past 34 years. The trap occurs when rising wages diminish a country’s competitive edge in cheap labor, and factors such as weak institutions, insufficient innovation, and gaps in education hinder further growth. The report recommends diversification, investment in human capital, and improved governance to overcome this challenge.

# First responder

India’s recent extension of $400 million in financial assistance and ₹3,000 crore (approximately $360 million) in a currency swap arrangement has significantly boosted the Maldives’ currency reserves, which had reached a record low. This support reflects the deep and strategic partnership between the two nations, rooted in both geography and history. The assistance comes as part of a broader diplomatic effort to strengthen ties between India and the Maldives, which has included discussions on infrastructure projects, **Free Trade Agreement (FTA) talks**, and a comprehensive **maritime security partnership**.

### Financial Support and Economic Partnership
India’s financial backing has provided crucial relief to the Maldives, especially in the face of dwindling currency reserves. The currency swap arrangement will also provide economic stability to the Maldives, enabling the country to manage its financial obligations more effectively. Additionally, India and the Maldives are looking to expand economic cooperation through infrastructure projects, which will likely enhance connectivity and boost both trade and tourism.

### Tourism and Investment
During his visits to Mumbai and Bengaluru, Maldivian President **Mohamed Muizzu** made a strong case for the revival of Indian tourism, which is vital for the Maldivian economy. Prior to the pandemic, India was one of the largest sources of tourists for the Maldives. Muizzu also emphasized creating more avenues for **investment and employment** opportunities, inviting Indian investors to participate in sectors such as hospitality, construction, and renewable energy.

### Strategic and Maritime Security Partnership
A key outcome of this renewed cooperation is the vision for a **comprehensive maritime security partnership** between India and the Maldives. The Indian Ocean is a strategic area for both nations, and the partnership focuses on ensuring security in the region, which is crucial for regional stability and safeguarding maritime trade routes.

### Diplomatic Ties and Regional Stability
This recent diplomatic engagement showcases the importance of **subtle diplomacy** over confrontational posturing. India has historically been the “first responder” for the Maldives in times of crisis, emphasizing the natural closeness of the two nations due to their geographic proximity. As Prime Minister Narendra Modi noted, India’s responsiveness and support reflect the enduring bonds between the two countries.

### Conclusion
The assistance and the broader strategic cooperation mark a positive turnaround in India-Maldives relations, which had seen some strain in recent years. The renewed focus on economic, security, and cultural ties will likely deepen the bilateral relationship, ensuring mutual benefit and regional stability in the Indian Ocean. This also highlights the effectiveness of diplomacy based on mutual respect and collaboration rather than forceful rhetoric.

> India extended $400 million in financial aid and ₹3,000 crore through a currency swap arrangement to bolster the Maldives' low currency reserves. This support, part of a broader diplomatic engagement, includes discussions on infrastructure projects, Free Trade Agreement (FTA) talks, and a comprehensive maritime security partnership. Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu urged the return of Indian tourists and sought increased investment in sectors like hospitality and construction. The collaboration highlights India's role as a “first responder” for the Maldives, underscoring the value of subtle diplomacy over confrontational tactics and reinforcing the historic ties between the two nations.

# The gruelling course of litigation in India

President Droupadi Murmu recently addressed the significant issue of court delays in India during the **National Conference of the District Judiciary**. In her speech, she highlighted how these delays contribute to a public reluctance to approach the courts, as people fear that their pursuit of justice will only complicate their lives further. She coined the term **‘black coat syndrome’**, symbolically likening it to **white coat hypertension**, a condition where patients experience elevated blood pressure in clinical settings due to anxiety. Similarly, the "black coat" — representing lawyers and the judiciary — can cause distress for litigants due to the perception of endless delays in the justice system.

### Court Delays: A Real and Pressing Issue
Court delays have long plagued the Indian judicial system, contributing to a backlog of over 4 crore cases. For many citizens, the judicial process seems daunting, not only because of its complexity but also because of the **gruelling timeframes**, **endless adjournments**, and the increasing **cost of litigation**. The President emphasized that the fear of these protracted timelines often discourages people from pursuing legal remedies, even in cases where justice is clearly needed.

### Factors Contributing to Delays
One of the primary reasons for these delays is inefficient **scheduling and case management** within the judiciary. Many cases suffer from a lack of clear timelines for filing documents, examining witnesses, and conducting hearings. This results in frequent and often unnecessary adjournments, dragging the process further. Additionally, the overburdened courts with an ever-increasing docket of cases also contribute to the slowing down of proceedings.

### Case Management: A Key to Efficiency
Effective **case management practices** are essential to alleviate these delays. Such practices involve setting **clear schedules** for the submission of documents, conducting hearings, and witness examinations. They also include restricting the number of adjournments granted to ensure that cases progress smoothly through the system. By implementing structured timelines and holding parties accountable for meeting deadlines, the judiciary can prevent unnecessary delays. Furthermore, better use of **technology** in courts for case tracking and documentation could play a pivotal role in streamlining the process and reducing delays.

### The Impact on Justice
The consequence of these delays is severe for litigants, especially those from marginalized sections of society, as they are left grappling with **high legal costs**, emotional distress, and uncertainty over outcomes. These delays erode trust in the judicial system, leading many to feel that justice is inaccessible or unfairly prolonged. The fear of engaging in litigation — similar to the "black coat syndrome" described by President Murmu — becomes a real deterrent for individuals seeking justice.

### Conclusion
President Murmu’s speech highlights the urgent need for reform in the judiciary's approach to case management and scheduling. While the judiciary plays a crucial role in upholding the rule of law, it must also ensure that its processes do not become an obstacle to justice. By adopting more efficient management practices and utilizing technology to speed up proceedings, the judiciary can alleviate the burden on litigants and restore public confidence in the legal system. Without such changes, the fear of endless legal entanglements will continue to haunt those seeking justice in India.

### At the level of the district judiciary

While stricter rules and rigid timelines are often suggested as solutions, the reality is more complex. It is crucial to recognise that all participants in the judicial system — judges, lawyers, litigants and witnesses — act with rationality and good intentions, though their actions are often influenced by various constraints and incentives. Court scheduling issues are deeply rooted in the complex interplay of these motivations. A holistic approach that considers the psychological and behavioural aspects of all stakeholders is essential for meaningful progress. Let us look at the challenges in the district judiciary.

Judges have a crucial role in enforcing case management timelines. But systemic pressures often compromise their ability to do so. Judges in the district judiciary have to prioritise cases, with directions from higher courts to dispose of these cases within a specific time or where target disposal numbers have been provided for case types. While such oversight aims to ensure timely justice, higher courts often impose deadlines without fully considering their impact on the overall scheduling in district courts. This forces district courts to allocate disproportionate resources to expedite certain cases, disrupting scheduling and creating delays. The Supreme Court of India and various High Courts have criticised this trend, noting that such directives often disrupt case management in district courts. A more balanced approach is needed, wherein higher courts’ deadlines align with district court operational realities to avoid exacerbating delays.

Various statutes and rules impose timelines for the disposing of cases or filing documents, but judges are often not incentivised to adhere to these deadlines. When extensions are permissible, judges frequently grant them beyond statutory deadlines, knowing that higher courts are likely to condone such delays if appealed. Judges who enforce these deadlines may face pressure from the bar, potentially affecting their career progression as they risk being labelled ‘difficult’ and subjected to constant complaints.

The performance evaluation system for judges of the district judiciary, known as the units system, exacerbates these challenges. Judges are awarded “units” or points based on the type and number of cases they dispose of, with different weights assigned to different case types. To maximise their units, judges might prioritise and dispose of the simpler cases quickly, allowing them to accumulate points more quickly. This can lead to a situation where judges focus on less complex cases to boost their unit count, potentially neglecting the more challenging cases that require substantial judicial intervention. By favouring cases that are easier to resolve and quicker to process, judges may inadvertently contribute to delays in more complex cases, which are sidelined or postponed.

### The impact down the line

Lawyers significantly impact court scheduling and case management. Often handling multiple cases scheduled across different courts on the same day, they strategically decide about which cases to attend to based on factors such as the likelihood of adjournment, the importance of the case, or the perceived mood and predispositions of a particular judge. This often leads to adjournments in some matters.

The lack of predictability in case hearings exacerbates this issue. Lawyers often do not have a clear understanding of when a particular case will be heard or the likelihood of adjournment, making it difficult to plan their schedules. Moreover, lawyers may request adjournments or deliberately delay proceedings if they perceive that the judge is likely to grant an adjournment, especially if their client has expressly asked for it. This lack of predictability and the strategic behaviour it encourages only adds to the congestion in court schedules.

The tendency to extend stays and interim orders further diminishes the interest of lawyers in actively pursuing a case. For litigants, obtaining a stay on a case can often be seen as a victory, especially in civil matters where a stay order may prevent any immediate adverse action. Consequently, once a stay is obtained, there may be little incentive in pushing for a speedy resolution, contributing to the backlog of cases.

Before a trial begins, the judge sets a schedule with specific dates for each witness’s testimony, and, accordingly, summons are issued. However, the timing of testimonies often becomes unpredictable due to changes in the court schedule, adjournments, and procedural delays. This disrupts daily life for witnesses, forcing them to leave their jobs, make travel arrangements and put personal responsibilities on hold, often without knowing when they would have to testify. The lack of a predictable schedule frustrates witnesses, is a financial strain, discourages their court appearances and contributes to trial delays.

### Need for holistic reform

To address court scheduling issues, a holistic approach is needed that goes beyond rules and timelines, and which focuses on incentivising all actors. Judges should be evaluated not just by the number of cases they dispose of but also by their ability to manage and resolve more complex cases within the prescribed timelines. The unit system needs reform so as to prioritise complex cases that require substantial judicial intervention, encouraging a broader range of case management. Lawyers need better scheduling information to reduce uncertainty and avoid unnecessary adjournments. Courts should implement predictable scheduling systems, introduce penalties for delays, and reward lawyers who adhere to schedules. Litigants should be discouraged from using stay orders and interim reliefs as delay tactics by making such orders temporary and subject to regular review. Witnesses require more predictability in court appearances, with advance notice and sufficient compensation beyond travel expenses to encourage their participation.

Technological solutions could enhance case management, providing real-time updates and the monitoring of timelines. Courts can adopt a data-driven approach to identify and address scheduling bottlenecks, improving overall judicial efficiency. Without reform that accounts for the human side of the system, any procedural changes will remain just that — paper reforms.

> In her address at the National Conference of the District Judiciary, President Droupadi Murmu highlighted the issue of **court delays**, which often deter people from seeking justice. She introduced the term **"black coat syndrome,"** comparing it to **white coat hypertension**, symbolizing the anxiety that lengthy legal processes cause. Court delays, driven by inefficient case management, frequent adjournments, and escalating legal costs, lead to public hesitation in approaching the judiciary. Murmu emphasized the need for **effective case management**—clear timelines for filings, hearings, and limiting adjournments—to restore public confidence and ensure timely justice.

Omar Abdullah, leader of the **National Conference (NC)** and former Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, is set to return to the position as NC legislators have endorsed him for the role. This decision came after a party meeting where a significant majority of party members expressed support for his leadership. Omar Abdullah, who previously served as Chief Minister from 2009 to 2015, has been a prominent political figure in the region and remains a key player in shaping the future of Jammu and Kashmir's political landscape.

This endorsement from National Conference legislators signals a strong comeback for Omar, particularly after the political uncertainties following the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir's special status under Article 370 in 2019. His leadership is expected to focus on restoring statehood and addressing the political and economic challenges that have emerged since the region’s reorganization into a Union Territory.

The move also comes amid broader political discussions in Jammu and Kashmir, as several parties are advocating for early assembly elections to restore democratic governance. The NC’s support for Omar Abdullah reflects the party's confidence in his ability to navigate the complex political terrain and lead the region toward stability.

Omar Abdullah's potential return as Chief Minister is seen as a key development in the region, where political representation and autonomy remain hotly debated issues. His leadership may focus on efforts to revive Jammu and Kashmir's economy, tackle unemployment, and ensure peace in a region that has experienced significant political upheaval over the past few years.

This announcement signals renewed momentum for the National Conference, which remains one of the largest political parties in Jammu and Kashmir, and places Omar Abdullah at the forefront of its efforts to reclaim political leadership in the region.
