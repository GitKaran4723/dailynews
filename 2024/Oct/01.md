# On gender performativity: how it challenges the gender binary

**Gender Performativity** is a concept introduced by poststructuralist scholar **Judith Butler** in her groundbreaking 1990 work, *Gender Trouble*. This idea challenges the traditional, essentialist views of gender, which associate biological sex with a fixed gender identity, typically divided into a binary of masculine and feminine. Instead, Butler argues that **gender is not an inherent identity** but a socially constructed and performative one. This notion has had a profound impact on gender theory, encouraging more fluid and non-binary understandings of identity.

### **Critique of Essentialism**

Essentialism posits that individuals are born with fixed biological and psychological traits that determine their gender identity. Under this view, gender correlates directly with biological sex — male bodies are associated with masculinity, and female bodies are associated with femininity. Butler critiques this notion by arguing that **gender is not the result of biology** but rather a **repeated performance** of actions, behaviours, and cultural norms associated with masculinity and femininity.

For example, societal norms might dictate that women should exhibit traits such as nurturing, softness, and emotional expressiveness, while men should display assertiveness, strength, and stoicism. However, Butler argues that these traits are not intrinsic to individuals but are learned and **reproduced through repeated actions**.

### **The Performativity of Gender**

Butler's concept of **gender performativity** suggests that gender is created and sustained through the **repetition of norms and behaviours**. It is not something that one *is*, but something that one *does* or *performs*. This performance is not a voluntary or conscious act but is constrained by the historical and social frameworks in which individuals operate. In Butler's words, "there is no gender identity behind the expressions of gender; that identity is performatively constituted by the very ‘expressions’ that are said to be its results."

The key idea here is that **gender identity is unstable** and can never be fully fixed or innate. Even though gender performances may appear persistent over time, they are constantly produced and reproduced through social interactions and expectations.

### **Subversion of Gender Norms**

An important implication of gender performativity is that gender norms can be **subverted** or **disrupted** through non-conformist actions. By refusing to conform to socially imposed gender roles or by consciously performing gender in a way that challenges these norms, individuals can expose the **constructed nature of gender**. For instance, drag performances, where individuals perform exaggerated or satirical versions of gender, demonstrate how gender can be manipulated, highlighting that it is a role one can take on, rather than a natural or biological truth.

Butler emphasizes that gender performativity has the potential to destabilize rigid categories of male and female by revealing their **arbitrary and constructed nature**. This creates space for more **fluid understandings of gender**, allowing for identities beyond the traditional male-female binary.

### **Implications for Gender Theory and Politics**

Butler's theory has had a profound impact on gender studies, queer theory, and feminist discourse. By suggesting that gender is performative, she opens the door for more inclusive and flexible ways of understanding identity, making room for **non-binary, transgender, and gender-nonconforming identities**.

Moreover, her work challenges the foundations of feminist theory that rely on a strict distinction between "women" and "men." Butler calls for a reconsideration of the categories upon which feminist politics is built, suggesting that fixed notions of "womanhood" may exclude certain individuals and reinforce the very binaries that feminists seek to dismantle.

In conclusion, **Judith Butler’s concept of gender performativity** transforms our understanding of gender from a fixed, biological characteristic to a fluid, dynamic process that is socially constructed and continuously performed. This theory not only critiques traditional views of gender but also offers a path for subversion and rethinking identity, enabling more inclusive frameworks that accommodate a diverse range of gender expressions.

> Judith Butler’s concept of **gender performativity**, introduced in *Gender Trouble* (1990), challenges traditional views of gender as fixed and biologically determined. Butler argues that **gender is not an innate identity** but a **socially constructed performance** enacted through repeated behaviors, actions, and societal norms. This means that gender is fluid and can be subverted by non-conformist actions, exposing its arbitrary nature. By destabilizing rigid male-female binaries, Butler's theory allows for more inclusive understandings of identity, supporting **non-binary, transgender, and gender-nonconforming expressions**, and reshaping feminist and queer theory.

# India’s ‘silver dividend’, challenge to opportunity

While the rising quantum and share of the elderly population is a global concern, **India and China**, the two population giants in the world, have a disproportionate share of the elderly given their large population size. And rising longevity is intensifying this concern every day. Therefore, it is pertinent to transform this challenge into an opportunity that involves suitable reforms to cater to the evolving needs of this population. In this regard, evidence indicates that it is not merely the quantum of this population but also its quality that needs attention and intervention.

### Rising health-care consumption and reform

For instance, the health-care consumption of this segment of the population, presently estimated at **$7 billion**, is rising. Such a rise in India is because three-quarters of the elderly have at least one chronic ailment along with a quarter of them having limitations in daily living. In addition, a third of them display depressive symptoms along with low-life satisfaction. When these adversities are coupled with economic insecurities, there is every reason to dwell on senior care reform to ensure the better well-being of this population segment.

Such a reform initiative needs to recognise the multi-sectoral attention involving health, social, economic/financial and, above all, digital domains towards mainstreaming the elderly within the evolving environment. Health empowerment and inclusion can happen by improving health literacy among the elderly and their care-givers. On this front, the initiative of adopting comprehensive health care at health and well-being centres under the renewed mission of the **Ayushman Arogya Mandir (AAM)** may be considered a good initiative. This involves a preventive, promotive, curative and rehabilitative component under the multiple system of **ayurveda, yoga, naturopathy, unani, siddha and homoeopathy (AYUSH)**.

Strengthening the health-care infrastructure to focus on the elderly by expanding tele-consultation services, enhancing the skilled workforce for the elderly, and capacity building of the existing workforce may facilitate the utilisation of health care among senior citizens despite limitations of means on the one hand and specific need on the other. This all-inclusive package has a mental health services aspect as well as nutrition-related services that will operationalise senior care through **preventive, wellness and therapeutic interventions** and is thus holistic.

### Addressing financial insecurities

The social inclusion of the elderly may well be served by sensitising the larger community on their needs and sensitivities and by establishing peer support groups for interaction. At the same time there is a need to make them aware of their entitlements and legal safeguards on inheritance, succession and protection that will help their confidence in handling ugly eventualities that could arise in the course of life.

Economic and financial insecurities need to be addressed through innovative schemes and plans specifically for the elderly, in terms of investments, to reduce their financial burden. Such a burden that is largely on account of health care costs may be protected with well-designed insurance products such as **₹5 lakh coverage for every individual above the age of 70 years**. Reskilling the younger population that is also aging (given their adaptability to modern technology and infrastructure) to be engaged in the labour market may be another option to maintain the economic independence of the elderly.

Finally, the inclusion of the elderly in a rapidly growing digital environment is equally important for the elderly to benefit from many schemes and programmes with ease and convenience. Digital adaption among the elderly still remains below expectation, excluding them from desirable schemes and benefits. Targeting the current elderly population and those younger who are also aging to go digital should get a second look from the domain of finance to the delivery of numerous care services that are meant for the elderly.

### As an economic segment

Besides this five-point care reform for seniors, the idea of turning this emerging challenge into an opportunity lies in viewing a silver economy that comprises economic activities, and goods and services catering to this population segment. On this count, the available worth of this economy is estimated at **₹73,082 crore** and is expected to grow manifold over the years. While the **60-plus share is estimated at 13.2% in 2031, and at 19% by mid-century**, the elderly will constitute a major consumer segment that is also characterised as the wealthiest given the professional in the age group of 45-64 years is the richest. Therefore, one has the quote these days which says ‘they become rich before they grow old’. Further, as health-care consumption is about a third of their entire consumption, it can ignite the health and wellness-driven businesses among the senior care segment in India. On the whole, the silver economy is set to grow in India and the world, with a market size that has potential for innovation in the health technology domain as well as utility infrastructure for varying limitations that come with age.

In recognition of this eventual reality, the government appears to have given consideration to rehabilitating the silver segment by launching the **Senior Able Citizens for Re-Employment in Dignity (SACRED) portal** to connect senior citizens with job providers in the private sector. Another initiative is the **Senior care Ageing Growth Engine (SAGE)**, by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, to promote and incentivise senior care products.

> The rising elderly population in India and China, driven by increased life expectancy and declining birth rates, poses significant socio-economic challenges, including healthcare, pensions, and social security. However, this demographic shift also presents opportunities. Prioritizing the **quality of life** for the elderly—through healthcare, reskilling, and social security reforms—can turn this challenge into an asset. Both nations can develop the **silver economy** and promote elderly workforce participation. By implementing policies that cater to their evolving needs, India and China can alleviate the strain on younger generations and foster sustainable socio-economic development.

# Having private participation in India’s nuclear energy

In July 2024, the Government of India, while presenting the Union Budget for FY 2024-25, made significant announcements regarding the expansion of India’s nuclear energy sector. The budget proposed partnerships with the private sector for research and development (R&D) of **Bharat Small Reactors (BSR)** and **Bharat Small Modular Reactors (BSMR)**, alongside new nuclear energy technologies. This move is part of India's broader ambition to decarbonize its energy sector and meet its clean energy goals.

### **India’s Nuclear Energy Ambitions**

The Government of India has recognized nuclear energy as a critical component of its strategy to achieve the dual objectives of **energy security** and **decarbonization**. India's pledge at the **COP26 Summit in Glasgow (2021)**, to generate 500 GW of non-fossil fuel-based energy by 2030, positions nuclear energy as a vital contributor. This is particularly crucial as India aims to transition away from coal-dominated energy sources while ensuring a stable energy supply for its rapidly growing economy.

The development of **BSR and BSMR** technologies aligns with global trends in the nuclear energy sector, where **Small Modular Reactors (SMRs)** are being viewed as the next generation of nuclear energy solutions. These reactors are smaller, more flexible, and generally safer due to their modular design. They can be deployed in remote locations, have lower upfront capital costs, and are easier to integrate into existing power grids compared to traditional large reactors.

### **Private Sector Participation in Nuclear Energy**

One of the key announcements in the 2024-25 budget was the push for greater **private sector involvement** in nuclear energy R&D. Historically, India's nuclear sector has been predominantly controlled by the **Department of Atomic Energy (DAE)**, with limited involvement of private entities. This new direction suggests a shift in policy, potentially opening up opportunities for collaboration with Indian and foreign private companies, especially in areas like reactor design, manufacturing, and fuel supply chains.

Private sector participation is expected to accelerate technological advancements in **small modular reactors** and other nuclear technologies, which could help reduce costs and improve safety measures. This initiative also aligns with India’s broader goal of fostering innovation and self-reliance (*Atmanirbhar Bharat*), especially in cutting-edge sectors like nuclear energy.

### **Decarbonization Goals and COP26 Pledge**

The announcement is part of India’s ambitious goal to achieve **500 GW of non-fossil fuel-based energy** by 2030. Nuclear energy, with its low-carbon footprint, plays a crucial role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and combating climate change. By expanding its nuclear energy capacity, India can significantly reduce its reliance on coal, which currently accounts for about 70% of its electricity generation.

At the **COP26 Summit**, Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid out India’s **Panchamrit strategy**, which includes commitments such as achieving net-zero emissions by 2070, increasing non-fossil energy capacity to 500 GW by 2030, and reducing the carbon intensity of the economy by 45% by 2030. Expanding the nuclear energy sector, especially through technologies like **BSR and BSMR**, will help India meet these targets.

### **Challenges and Opportunities**

While nuclear energy offers significant advantages in terms of reliability and low emissions, there are challenges to its expansion in India. These include **high initial capital costs**, **regulatory hurdles**, **public perception of safety**, and **long project timelines**. However, the introduction of **small modular reactors** and **private sector partnerships** could help mitigate some of these challenges by reducing costs, improving efficiency, and speeding up deployment.

Furthermore, the development of **newer nuclear technologies** will contribute to creating a **robust energy infrastructure** that can support India’s growing energy demand. It will also reduce India's dependence on fossil fuel imports, contributing to energy security.

### **Conclusion**

The Government of India’s proposal in the 2024-25 budget to expand the nuclear energy sector by fostering private sector involvement and developing **Bharat Small Reactors (BSR)** and **Bharat Small Modular Reactors (BSMR)** marks a significant step towards achieving the country’s clean energy and decarbonization goals. This move is not only crucial for meeting India’s commitments under the **COP26 climate pledge** but also for ensuring energy security and sustainability in the long run. By adopting innovative technologies and engaging the private sector, India is poised to become a global leader in the nuclear energy sector while addressing its growing energy needs in a sustainable manner.

# Steady but slow

In July, NASA announced the cancellation of its **Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (VIPER)** mission, designed to explore the moon’s south pole. VIPER was part of NASA’s ambitious plans to map the distribution of water-ice on the moon, a critical resource for future lunar exploration and potentially for human habitation. The rover, resembling a small golf-cart, was supposed to survey the soils over a three-month period to better understand the concentration and location of water-ice deposits. This data was vital for planning future manned missions to the moon and beyond, as water could be used for sustaining astronauts and generating fuel for long-term space missions.

The mission's cancellation came after development issues, including significant delays and escalating costs, despite the rover being nearly fully assembled and having passed several important tests. This decision, while financially and logistically justified from NASA’s perspective, dismayed many in the scientific community, who saw VIPER as crucial for understanding the moon’s polar resources. 

VIPER was set to be launched by a **SpaceX Falcon Heavy** rocket and delivered to the lunar surface by Astrobotic’s **Griffin** lander, all as part of NASA’s **Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS)** program. This program is a key element of NASA’s broader efforts to collaborate with private companies to advance lunar exploration. Astrobotic's involvement in the mission highlighted the increasing role of commercial partners in NASA’s space missions, a shift from the agency’s earlier era of internally managed projects.

The moon’s south pole is of particular interest to NASA and other space agencies due to its permanently shadowed craters, where scientists believe water-ice has accumulated over billions of years. Such resources are viewed as essential not just for scientific research, but for practical applications, such as sustaining human colonies or enabling deeper space exploration by providing essential materials like hydrogen and oxygen.

The cancellation of VIPER underlines the complexity and high stakes of lunar exploration. Landing on the moon remains a challenging and expensive venture. While the decision to cancel the mission might save short-term costs, the loss of potential data from VIPER could delay the understanding of lunar resources and impact future missions to establish a human presence on the moon.

Although the scientific community expressed frustration, NASA's decision reflects the realities of managing large-scale space missions within budget constraints. The cancellation of VIPER reminds us that even in an era of technological advancements, space exploration is fraught with challenges, from budgetary limitations to technical delays, which can influence even the most promising missions.Yet, India missed a trick when, on **September 18**, the Union Cabinet approved a proposal by the **Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)** to begin the second phase of the country’s lunar programme with **Chandrayaan-4**, a sample-return mission.

Moments after the Chandrayaan-3 lander descended on the moon’s surface on August 23, 2023, reports erupted to claim India had yet again admitted itself into a small, elite group of countries that have achieved an autonomous lunar soft-landing. But such proclamations overlook the considerable gaps between these countries’ space agencies from an operations perspective. One pertinent difference is that ISRO is unable to execute multiple flagship missions in parallel. Instead, it follows a **‘one major mission at a time’** cadence that, in exchange for maximising resource use efficiency, leaves the organisation incapable of manoeuvring rapidly to respond to new opportunities. Had it been able, ISRO could have sought the Cabinet’s approval for the ‘Lunar Polar Explorer’ mission it is planning with its Japanese counterpart, to land a rover on the moon to perform many of the crucial tasks VIPER was expected to, especially prospecting for large water-ice deposits. Even now, the VIPER incident should remind the Centre that despite an expanding allocation and new funding modes in the offing, the Indian space programme needs more resources to realise its full potential.

> NASA canceled its **Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (VIPER)** mission in July due to delays and rising costs, despite the rover being fully assembled and tested. The decision disappointed the scientific community as VIPER was designed to map water-ice in the moon’s south pole region, vital for future lunar exploration. The rover was to be launched by a **SpaceX Falcon Heavy** rocket and deployed by **Astrobotic’s Griffin lander** under NASA's **Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS)** program. Though financially justified, the cancellation highlights the ongoing challenges of lunar exploration, including high costs and the loss of valuable data for future missions.

# Kathak: A Classical Dance Form with Storytelling Brilliance

**Kathak: A Classical Dance Form with Storytelling Brilliance**

Kathak is one of the eight classical dance forms of India, with its roots deeply embedded in North Indian culture. The word "Kathak" is derived from the Sanskrit word *katha*, meaning "story," and *kathakar*, meaning "storyteller." Originally, Kathak was performed by traveling bards who recounted mythological and moral stories through dance, using expressive hand gestures, facial expressions, and rhythmic footwork. Over time, Kathak evolved into a sophisticated dance form under the patronage of both Hindu and Mughal rulers, blending elements of devotional themes with courtly entertainment.

### **Historical Evolution of Kathak**
Kathak's origins can be traced back to the temples of ancient northern India, where it was primarily a medium for storytelling. The dance was used to narrate the epics like the *Mahabharata* and *Ramayana*, making it a significant tool for both entertainment and education. With the arrival of Mughal influence in India, Kathak absorbed Persian and Islamic cultural elements, which led to changes in its presentation. The emphasis shifted from solely religious stories to include more abstract themes, and the costumes, music, and movements became more refined. 

Mughal courts transformed Kathak into a courtly dance form, characterized by intricate footwork, fast spins (*chakkars*), and expressive gestures. However, despite this transformation, the essence of storytelling remained at the heart of Kathak.

### **Key Features of Kathak**
1. **Narrative Style**: Kathak's strength lies in its ability to convey stories. Performers use expressive facial expressions (*abhinaya*) and hand gestures (*mudras*) to narrate tales from Hindu mythology, particularly episodes from Krishna's life, such as the *Raas Leela*. The *abhinaya* in Kathak also incorporates subtle emotional expressions, making the storytelling rich and multifaceted.

2. **Intricate Footwork**: A signature element of Kathak is its complex footwork, often performed to the beat of a *tabla* or *pakhawaj*. Dancers wear ankle bells (*ghungroos*) to emphasize rhythm and synchronize their movements with the music.

3. **Graceful Spins**: *Chakkars* or spins are a hallmark of Kathak, showcasing the dancer’s balance, control, and technical prowess. The number of spins a dancer performs in one breath is often a measure of their skill.

4. **Costume and Music**: Kathak costumes reflect a blend of Hindu and Mughal aesthetics. Female dancers typically wear an *angrakha* (similar to a frock) with a dupatta, while male dancers wear a traditional kurta or *churidar*. Music plays a crucial role, with classical Hindustani compositions and instruments like the *tabla*, *sarangi*, and *sitar* accompanying the performance.

5. **Two Gharanas**: Kathak has several schools or *gharanas*, each with its distinctive style. The Jaipur Gharana emphasizes powerful footwork, while the Lucknow Gharana is known for its expressive gestures and *abhinaya*.

> Kathak is one of India’s classical dance forms, known for its storytelling through dance. Originating in ancient northern India, it started as a temple dance narrating mythological stories from epics like the *Ramayana* and *Mahabharata*. Under Mughal influence, Kathak evolved into a courtly dance, adding elements of Persian and Islamic art. The dance is characterized by intricate footwork, fast spins, expressive gestures, and rhythmic movements, performed to classical Hindustani music. With its rich cultural and historical significance, Kathak represents a blend of Hindu and Mughal traditions, making it an important topic for the UPSC syllabus on Indian culture.

# Keep gods away from politics, SC tells Naidu

On Monday, the Supreme Court addressed the issue surrounding the alleged use of animal fat, specifically lard, in the preparation of the famous Tirupati laddus during the previous YSRCP (Yuvajana Sramika Rythu Congress Party) regime in Andhra Pradesh. The controversy came to light when Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu made public statements claiming that animal fat was used in the sacred prasad, sparking significant public concern and political debate.

The Supreme Court, however, clarified that there is currently no evidence to support these allegations. During the hearing, the bench expressed dissatisfaction with the way the issue was handled by Chief Minister Naidu, remarking that he should have “kept the gods away from politics.” The court criticized the Chief Minister for making such serious public statements without verifying the facts, thereby giving rise to unnecessary speculation and political tensions. 

The issue, which stirred emotions given the religious significance of the Tirupati laddus, created a rift between political parties, with the YSRCP strongly denying any wrongdoing during its administration. The laddus, offered as prasad in the Tirumala temple, are of great cultural and spiritual importance to devotees, and any tampering with their preparation was bound to cause a public outcry.

The Supreme Court's observation comes as a relief to the temple authorities and devotees, as the laddus have a long-standing tradition of being made with pure and vegetarian ingredients. The court emphasized that such sensitive religious matters should not be politicized, and that leaders need to exercise caution before making inflammatory remarks without substantive proof.

The controversy serves as a reminder of how religious issues can quickly escalate in India's charged political climate. The court’s remarks reflect its concern over maintaining the sanctity of religious practices and the need for responsible conduct by political leaders when dealing with such matters.
