# CEC slams exit polls, early trends on TV channels

**Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Rajiv Kumar** has raised concerns over the impact of **exit polls** on public perception and the electoral process. He highlighted how these polls often create unrealistic expectations among voters by projecting outcomes that do not align with actual election results, thereby distorting the democratic process. This, Kumar believes, leads to unnecessary speculation and disappointment when the results differ from the predictions.

Kumar emphasized the need for **corrective measures** to address the growing influence of exit polls, which are usually broadcast extensively by media outlets. He particularly criticized the practice of news channels showing early leads even before the actual vote counting begins, calling it **“nonsense”**. This practice, according to the CEC, misleads the public and undermines the credibility of the electoral process by presenting speculative data as concrete information.

The Election Commission of India (ECI) has strict guidelines on the **timing and dissemination of exit poll data**, yet the media’s rush to report early results often flouts these regulations, contributing to confusion. Kumar's call for reforms reflects growing concerns about the media's role in shaping election narratives prematurely.

In conclusion, **CEC Rajiv Kumar** is advocating for a more responsible approach to exit polls and early election coverage. His remarks suggest that media outlets need to adhere to stricter norms to ensure that the sanctity of elections and voter confidence are maintained.

**Exit polls** are a common feature in democratic elections and refer to surveys conducted immediately after voters have cast their ballots but before the official counting of votes has begun. These polls aim to predict the outcome of an election based on responses from a sample of voters about whom they voted for. Exit polls differ from **opinion polls**, which are conducted before the election, in that exit polls gather data from actual voters, theoretically providing a more accurate picture of the final result.

### How Exit Polls Work:

1. **Sampling**: In exit polls, voters leaving the polling stations are asked which candidate or party they voted for. Polling agencies use statistical methods to ensure that the sample of voters questioned is representative of the broader voting population. They often take into account factors like region, age, gender, and social class to avoid bias.

2. **Data Collection**: Trained field workers collect the data in person, by telephone, or through electronic surveys. The data is then aggregated to project the likely winner of the election. The accuracy of the projection depends on how representative the sample is and how willing voters are to disclose their choice truthfully.

3. **Projections and Margin of Error**: Based on the exit poll data, agencies project the number of seats or votes a candidate or party is likely to win. However, the projections come with a **margin of error**, acknowledging that no sample can perfectly represent an entire population.

### Significance and Controversies:

1. **Early Indicators**: Exit polls provide a snapshot of voter behavior and are often seen as an early indicator of election results. They help the media and political analysts understand trends and how certain issues may have influenced voters. 

2. **Impact on Public Perception**: Exit polls can shape public perception by creating a narrative before the official results are declared. If exit polls predict a win for a particular party, it can influence public discourse, expectations, and even the stock market. This is why Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar has raised concerns about their potential to **distort expectations**.

3. **Accuracy and Failures**: While exit polls can provide valuable insights, they are not always accurate. Errors can arise due to small sample sizes, biased sampling, or incorrect voter responses. For example, in various elections, exit polls have either overestimated or underestimated the performance of certain political parties, leading to **discrepancies between the polls and actual results**.

4. **Regulation**: In countries like India, the **Election Commission** has strict guidelines on when and how exit poll data can be released. Exit polls cannot be broadcast until after voting has concluded to avoid influencing voter behavior in later phases of a multi-phase election. Violation of these rules can lead to legal consequences for the media outlets involved.

5. **Recent Criticisms**: The CEC's recent comments highlight the growing concerns about exit polls in India's elections. He pointed out that exit polls often create **unrealistic expectations**, and media houses rushing to report **early leads** before counting has officially started is misleading and detrimental to the electoral process.

### Importance of Responsible Use:

While exit polls are a useful tool in understanding electoral trends, their accuracy and responsible use are crucial. Misinterpreting or misusing exit poll data can lead to public confusion and a potential loss of trust in democratic processes. Ensuring strict adherence to legal guidelines and improving the accuracy of these polls are essential steps in maintaining the integrity of elections.

In conclusion, exit polls can be informative, but their limitations and impact on public opinion necessitate careful use and regulation to ensure they do not undermine the credibility of the democratic process.

# Northeast monsoon sets in over T.N.

The **northeast monsoon** has officially set in over **Tamil Nadu** and **Puducherry**, bringing substantial rainfall to the region. On Tuesday, northern parts of the state, including **Chennai** and its neighboring districts, experienced heavy showers. This marks the beginning of the monsoon season, which typically occurs between **October and December**, providing significant rainfall to the southeastern coast of India, especially Tamil Nadu.

### Importance of Northeast Monsoon for Tamil Nadu

The northeast monsoon is crucial for **Tamil Nadu** as the state relies heavily on it for rainfall, given that it does not receive substantial precipitation during the southwest monsoon. In fact, **48% of Tamil Nadu's annual rainfall** comes from the northeast monsoon. The rains are essential for **agriculture**, as many crops in the state, including rice, depend on this period for water supply.

### Impact of the Rains

The rains on Tuesday brought relief from the heat but also raised concerns about potential **flooding** in low-lying areas, especially in **Chennai**, a city that has faced significant flooding issues in the past. Authorities have put emergency services on alert and urged citizens to take precautions. The monsoon often leads to waterlogging, disrupted traffic, and damage to infrastructure in urban areas like Chennai, necessitating preparedness measures by local governments.

### Forecast

The **India Meteorological Department (IMD)** has predicted continued rainfall in the coming days across northern Tamil Nadu, including **Chennai, Kancheepuram, and Tiruvallur districts**. The department has also issued warnings for heavy to very heavy rainfall in these regions, advising residents to stay informed and take necessary precautions.

In conclusion, the onset of the northeast monsoon is a vital event for Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, impacting agriculture, water resources, and daily life. While it brings much-needed rain, the region must remain vigilant to manage the risks of flooding and infrastructure damage.

**Monsoons** refer to seasonal winds that bring significant changes in weather patterns, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions like **South Asia**. The term "monsoon" is often associated with the **rainy season** in these regions, as the winds carry moist air from oceans to the land, resulting in heavy rainfall.

### Types of Monsoons

1. **Southwest Monsoon**: 
   - Occurs from **June to September** and is responsible for most of India's annual rainfall.
   - Winds blow from the **Indian Ocean** towards the land, bringing moisture-laden air that results in significant rainfall, particularly in western and southern India.
   - This monsoon is crucial for agriculture, as the rain supports crops like rice, wheat, and sugarcane.

2. **Northeast Monsoon**:
   - Happens from **October to December**, affecting states like **Tamil Nadu** and **Puducherry**.
   - Winds come from the **northeast**, passing over the **Bay of Bengal** and bringing rainfall to southeastern India.
   - This monsoon is critical for Tamil Nadu, which receives **48%** of its annual rainfall during this period.

### Mechanism of Monsoon

Monsoons are driven by the **differential heating** of land and water. During summer, the land heats up faster than the ocean, causing air over the land to rise and creating a low-pressure area. Moist air from the ocean is drawn towards the land, where it cools, condenses, and falls as rain. In winter, the process reverses, with the land cooling faster, leading to the northeast monsoon winds.

### Significance of Monsoons

Monsoons are vital for:
- **Agriculture**: The bulk of Indian farming is rain-fed, making monsoons essential for crops and food security.
- **Water Resources**: Monsoons replenish groundwater, reservoirs, and rivers, supporting drinking water and irrigation.
  
However, **excessive rainfall** can lead to **flooding**, while weak monsoons may cause **droughts**, both of which have significant socio-economic impacts.

> The **northeast monsoon** has officially set in over **Tamil Nadu** and **Puducherry**, bringing heavy rains, especially to northern parts like **Chennai** and nearby districts. This monsoon, occurring from **October to December**, is crucial for Tamil Nadu as it provides **48% of the state's annual rainfall**, supporting agriculture and replenishing water resources. While the rain offers relief from the heat, it raises concerns about **flooding**, particularly in **Chennai**, which has a history of waterlogging during heavy monsoon periods. The **India Meteorological Department (IMD)** has forecast continued rainfall, urging residents to stay vigilant and take necessary precautions.

# The Peace Nobel this year should stir debates on nuclear disarmament

Seventy-nine years after Hiroshima and Nagasaki were subject to unprecedented devastation following the U.S.’s act of dropping atomic bombs on these cities, **Nihon Hidankyo**, the organisation that worked for the welfare of the survivors — called the **hibakusha** — and steadfastly sought to build consensus on the need for the abolition of nuclear weapons, has been awarded the **Nobel Peace Prize for 2024**. Today, there are barely more than a lakh survivors of the bombings, with the average age of the hibakusha more than 86 years. An estimated 1.5 lakh people died due to the bombings, and many more later due to the after-effects of the exposure to radioactivity. The horrors of the atomic bombings and the inaction by the post-war government, largely due to U.S. censorship of news of the suffering of the hibakusha, crystallised in the formation of the Hidankyo which lobbied and agitated for medical and welfare benefits to the hibakusha and took a steadfast position against atomic weapons. This is emphasised in their slogan, **“no more hibakusha”**. Besides their activism in Japan, the Hidankyo also went on tours to several countries, including India, to share their suffering and sensitise the world to the horrors of the use of atomic weapons. The Nobel Committee must be commended for recognising the Hidankyo, whose activism as some scholars aver, helped shift the political discourse in Japan towards greater democracy and justice and sensitise the public to the doctrine of pacifism, which was incorporated into Japan’s Constitution after its defeat in the Second World War.

**Nuclear disarmament** refers to the reduction or elimination of nuclear weapons, with the ultimate goal of creating a world free of these devastating arms. The topic has been a subject of intense debate in international forums, with diverse perspectives on its feasibility, necessity, and potential risks.

### Key Arguments in Favor of Nuclear Disarmament:

1. **Global Security**:
   Advocates argue that nuclear disarmament reduces the risk of nuclear war, which could have catastrophic consequences on a global scale. The use of nuclear weapons would result in massive loss of life, environmental destruction, and long-term radiation effects.

2. **Humanitarian Concerns**:
   Many organizations, including the **International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN)**, emphasize the devastating humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons. Even a limited nuclear exchange would cause tremendous civilian casualties, disrupt global food systems, and create a "nuclear winter."

3. **Non-Proliferation and Treaty Obligations**:
   Nuclear disarmament is seen as a fulfillment of the **Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)**, where nuclear-armed states committed to pursuing disarmament in exchange for non-nuclear-armed states agreeing not to develop nuclear weapons. Disarmament proponents believe this would uphold global trust and prevent further nuclear proliferation.

4. **Moral and Ethical Responsibility**:
   Many argue from an ethical standpoint that nuclear weapons are inherently immoral due to their indiscriminate and inhumane nature. Religious groups and peace organizations often champion this view, calling for total abolition as a moral imperative.

### Key Arguments Against Nuclear Disarmament:

1. **Deterrence Doctrine**:
   Opponents of disarmament argue that nuclear weapons serve as a deterrent to large-scale wars. The **Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD)** theory suggests that the existence of nuclear weapons prevents nations from engaging in conflict due to the guaranteed devastating consequences.

2. **Strategic Stability**:
   Critics of disarmament also emphasize that nuclear weapons provide a balance of power, especially among major powers. For example, during the Cold War, the nuclear arsenal of the U.S. and the Soviet Union was seen as a stabilizing force that prevented direct confrontation.

3. **Security Risks**:
   Many nations, especially those surrounded by adversaries, see nuclear weapons as essential for their national security. Countries like **India, Pakistan, and North Korea** argue that nuclear arms provide a safeguard against external threats, especially when diplomatic measures fail.

4. **Verification Challenges**:
   A significant concern is how to verify that all nuclear-armed states have truly disarmed. Even if countries agree to disarmament, the hidden retention or covert development of nuclear weapons by one state could give them a major advantage, sparking security concerns globally.

### Contemporary Debates:

1. **Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW)**:
   Adopted in 2017, the **TPNW** represents a legal framework for the total elimination of nuclear weapons. However, nuclear-armed states and many of their allies oppose this treaty, arguing that it undermines existing security arrangements and the **NPT**.

2. **Modernization of Nuclear Arsenals**:
   Rather than moving towards disarmament, some nuclear-armed nations, including the U.S. and Russia, are investing in the modernization of their nuclear arsenals. This has led to concerns about a renewed arms race.

3. **Regional Tensions**:
   In regions like South Asia and the Korean Peninsula, nuclear disarmament seems distant due to ongoing tensions between nuclear-armed neighbors. These regional disputes complicate global disarmament efforts.

### Conclusion:

The debate on nuclear disarmament is complex, balancing the idealistic vision of a world free from nuclear weapons against pragmatic concerns about security and deterrence. While many countries and organizations continue to push for disarmament, geopolitical realities and strategic interests make the path to a nuclear-free world challenging.

# A food-sufficient India needs to be hunger-free too

Ending hunger, food insecurity and any form of malnutrition is one of the Sustainable Development Goals set to be realised by 2030. Such a goal is far removed from its realisation given rising conflicts, climate vulnerability and extremes as well as economic slowdown in regions that remain vulnerable and food deficient.

Food insecurity and malnutrition are a manifestation of a lack of access to and the unaffordability of healthy diets. In fact, food sufficiency serves as a pre-requisite to address hunger. But for a nation to be food sufficient, it needs to have an ideal distributional mechanism that ensures universal access to food that is affordable. Further, adequate food does not necessarily imply balanced food intake with all required nutrients to address the concern of malnourishment. Hence, a transformation from a hunger-free environment to a nutritionally compliant one needs to take into account the unaffordability of healthy diets, unhealthy food intakes and their underlying inequalities across the population segment.

### A lack of purchasing capacity

The global hunger assessment based on the prevalence of undernourishment shows a continuing lack of progress towards the goal of zero hunger. The global magnitude of the undernourished has risen to 9.4%, or 757 million people as of 2023. It is disproportionate in the African region with 20.4% facing hunger. In comparison, 8.1% in Asia, 6.2% in Latin America and the Caribbean and 7.3% in Oceania are undernourished. However, in real counts, Asia is home to the largest magnitude of those who are hungry — 384.5 million — as compared with 298.4 million in Africa.

The projected trends too are more disappointing in the sense that by the end of this decade, i.e., 2030, half of the world’s hungry/undernourished will be in Africa. The other distinct feature of undernourishment is its rural bias with a marginal advantage in urban and semi-urban areas. The gender divide in this adversity disadvantages women over men although such a divide is narrowing.

While food insecurity results in undernourishment or manifestation of hunger, the intrinsic connect lies with the lack of a purchasing capacity for adequate food. In this perspective, the cost and affordability of a healthy diet (CoHD) assumes significance. The cost of a healthy diet has risen in recent years world-wide, peaking at an average of 3.96 purchasing power parity (PPP) dollars per person per day in 2022. This undoubtedly varies across world regions in PPP terms, with the same being at $4.20 in Asia.

Despite rising CoHD, those unable to afford a healthy diet at the global level decreased from 2.88 billion in 2021 to 2.83 billion in 2022. However, in low-income countries, many still lack access to a healthy diet. This is a real threat to the dream target of zero hunger in the world by 2030. A practical solution lies in regulating food prices and a reduced share of food expenditure in the total expenditure that makes healthy diets universally affordable. On this count the Indian scene is examined with a focus on thalinomics that contemplates rising affordability for a nutritionally compliant meal for every Indian.

A recent exploration shows that the share of the rural Indian population in 2011 unable to afford the cost of a required diet (CoRD) even with 100% income spent on food would be 63.3% or 527.4 million. There is a lack of improvement in food security and uneven progress in economic access to healthy diets. This is a wake-up call. For this to change, there needs to be a transformation of India’s agri-food system so that it builds resilience in its major drivers and addresses inequalities, ensuring that healthy diets are available and affordable for all.

### Unhealthy diets in India

Diets in India are generally unhealthy and there is an imbalance in composition in relation to the EAT-Lancet reference (‘the first full scientific review of what constitutes a healthy diet from a sustainable food system’) or the recommendations by the Indian Council of Medical Research. In fact, qualifying such reference diets would not be affordable for much of the low income population. In South Asia, a reference diet might cost 60% of the mean daily per capita household income. The lack of affordability of healthy foods may be one of the reasons for their low consumption in India.

However, in the midst of subsidies and market regulation of prices of basic food such as cereals in India, low affordability may not be the sole reason for non-compliance with required food intake.

Evidence suggests that the richest 5% of Indian households too consume less of protein rich food against processed food. This points to a lack of availability, accessibility, awareness, and acceptability being the other major causes for the poor quality of diets.

### On the Global Hunger Index

Going back to the assessment of hunger globally and in India, there is continuing controversy in relation to the Global Hunger Index (GHI) that places India poorly in relation to other nations. However, close attention to this issue has not been given as the GHI connects less with hunger per say. This is because its components are more about nutrition and early age mortality. The realistic hunger domain may go well beyond food insecurity and nutritional compliance to the basics of having a square meal a day. This is a statistic that is much available in our own surveys which shows the number of meals consumed by individuals in the last 30 days. Such information reveals the average number of meals consumed in a day. According to these statistics by the NSSO on the recent consumption expenditure surveys, 3.2% of the Indian population are not compliant with a minimum of 60 meals in a month, which is equal to a square meal a day. In fact, more than 50% of the population are reported to have three meals a day. Using the calculation of those who fall short of having two square meals a day, one arrives at the calculation of 2.5% of the population that might fall under this category. In a population of 140 crore, this can be calculated as 3.5 crore, which is still a number that cannot be ignored.

World Food Day this year has the theme ‘Right to foods for a better life and a better future’, which highlights the significance of a hunger-free world with the universal right to food. Although a right to food campaign in India has gained sufficient momentum to ensure food security for every citizen, the ground reality reflects some failure. There are situations and circumstances wherein individuals may go hungry as they do not have the means to buy food. But mechanisms to provide free food by setting up food banks that evolve as a way to avoid food waste may be an ideal alternative. Discouraging food waste and organising proper food collection and distribution may be a step in ensuring that no one is left hungry.

A nation that is proud about being self-sufficient in its food needs to qualify as being a hunger-free nation as well. Food sufficient regions in the world should ensure redistribution in a humanitarian manner so that the food deficient ones are not left out.

> Achieving the **Sustainable Development Goal** of ending **hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition** by **2030** appears increasingly difficult. Global challenges such as **conflicts**, **climate change**, and **economic slowdowns** are worsening food insecurity, especially in vulnerable and food-deficient regions. Rising conflicts disrupt agricultural production, climate extremes cause crop failures, and economic downturns reduce access to affordable food, leaving many communities at risk. With these compounded issues, the path toward eliminating hunger and ensuring food security for all remains uncertain, requiring urgent global action and coordinated efforts to address the underlying causes of food insecurity.

# Food access is about equitable agrifood systems

**October 16, 2024** is World Food Day with the theme this year being **‘right to foods for a better life and a better future’**. The theme highlights the importance of access to safe, nutritious, and affordable food for all. The Rome-based agencies, the **Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the World Food Programme (WFP)** are collaborating with the Government of India to uphold this human right, which is essential for healthy, productive lives free from hunger and malnutrition.

Food security is vital for individual well-being and social stability. Access to food supports peaceful, prosperous communities. The FAO’s 2024 report estimates that 733 million people face hunger, highlighting the urgency of addressing food insecurity.

India’s Green Revolution was crucial for food availability. Now, the focus includes nutrition, which is vital for children’s development and economic productivity. Initiatives such as the White Revolution in milk and the Blue Transformation in fisheries have transformed India’s agrifood system. These efforts highlight the need for diverse food sources, ensuring safe and nutritious food for everyone. We can address inequalities and empower marginalised communities by prioritising the right to food and nutrition security.

### India’s journey towards food security

India has made significant strides in food security over the past 60 years. Once a food-deficient nation, it has transformed itself into a food-surplus country, driven by the Green Revolution, effective policies, advancements from institutions such as the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, and improved supply chains. Millions have contributed to ensuring reliable food access for India’s growing population, even in these challenging times.

A key pillar of India’s food security is the **National Food Security Act (NFSA) of 2013**, which provides food entitlements to over **800 million citizens**. Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently approved the distribution of fortified rice from July 2024 to December 2028, reflecting India’s commitment to improving nutrition and food security.

India’s food safety systems reflect a strong commitment to preventing hunger among its citizens. The effective collaboration between national policies and local initiatives showcases the robustness of the country’s food security framework. As India advances, these systems will be crucial for fostering resilience to future environmental, economic, or health-related issues.

### Challenges in the agriculture sector

While India’s agricultural sector is the cornerstone of its economy, it faces several challenges. Of its **93.09 million** agrarian households, approximately **82% are small and marginal farmers** holding less than two hectares of land. These farmers encounter various difficulties that impact productivity and rural livelihoods.

Natural resource degradation challenges us. Overusing groundwater strains water tables while chemical fertilizers and monocropping harm soil and agricultural productivity. Ongoing improvements in water usage and soil management are crucial. Fragmented landholding limits smallholder farmers’ adoption of modern techniques, reducing productivity and income. Enhancing access to appropriate technologies is vital.

Improving market access is also crucial. Many smallholder farmers need help accessing markets effectively due to infrastructure limitations and supply chain inefficiencies. By facilitating better links between production and markets, farmers can increase their incomes and reduce food waste.

Rural poverty and inequality also present ongoing challenges. Ensuring that small and marginal farmers can access financial services, technology and modern irrigation systems will be vital for improving agricultural productivity and enhancing their livelihoods.

While climate change continues to pose risks to agriculture, including erratic weather patterns, addressing these risks through sustainable agricultural practices such as water conservation and soil health restoration can help to build resilience in farming communities.

The Rome-based agencies and the Government of India also promote natural resource management, market access and modern agricultural practices. By providing education, technology, financial support and resources to vulnerable communities, we aim to empower smallholder farmers and create a sustainable agricultural system that ensures food security and rural prosperity.

The Right to Food extends beyond agriculture and touches the lives of all citizens, including the millions living in non-agricultural households. Access to safe, nutritious and affordable food is a fundamental human right for all, regardless of employment or location. With increasing urbanisation, ensuring food security for non-farming families is as important as supporting rural farmers.

Food availability for non-agricultural households relies on a resilient food system. Addressing food inequality and ensuring everyone has access to nutritious food, especially in urban areas, are essential. Strong social safety nets and market interventions are crucial for stabilising prices and supporting the most vulnerable.

Through the **Public Distribution System**, India has made significant progress in ensuring food access across agricultural and non-agricultural households. Continued efforts are necessary to address food access inequalities and ensure that everyone benefits from India’s agricultural advancements.

### Collective responsibility

On **World Food Day 2024**, we are reminded that ensuring food access is not just about increasing production but also building equitable, resilient, and sustainable agrifood systems that work for everyone. The partnership between the FAO, the IFAD, the WFP, and the Government of India underscores our collective responsibility to achieve food security.

We must continue to support both farmers and non-agricultural families, strengthen livelihoods, and reduce food inequalities, ensuring that no one is left behind in our collective responsibility to achieve the foundation for a healthier, more prosperous, and peaceful society where everyone can contribute to and benefit from a better life and a better future.

> **World Food Day** on **October 16, 2024**, focuses on the theme **'Right to Foods for a Better Life and a Better Future'**. This theme emphasizes the crucial need for everyone to have access to **safe, nutritious, and affordable food** as a fundamental human right. Collaborating with the **Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)**, the **International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)**, and the **World Food Programme (WFP)**, the **Government of India** aims to ensure food security and address hunger and malnutrition. The theme underscores that access to adequate food is essential for healthy, productive lives and building a hunger-free future.

# A Nobel for explaining why nations fail

The **2024 Nobel Prize in Economics** was awarded to **Daron Acemoglu**, **Simon Johnson**, and **James A. Robinson** for their groundbreaking work on the role of **institutions** in shaping the prosperity of nations. Their research delves into the core question of why some countries are rich while others are poor, highlighting the critical role that political and economic institutions play in determining a nation's long-term success or failure.

### Significance of Their Work

The Nobel laureates have argued that the quality of **institutions**, rather than geography, natural resources, or historical accidents, is the key determinant of economic prosperity. They highlight the importance of **inclusive institutions** that provide opportunities for broad participation in economic and political life. In contrast, **extractive institutions**, which concentrate power and wealth in the hands of a few, stifle innovation, investment, and long-term growth.

Their thesis is most famously articulated in the **2012 book** _Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty_, co-authored by **Daron Acemoglu** and **James A. Robinson**. In this book, the authors explain how inclusive institutions, which are characterized by strong property rights, rule of law, and accountable governance, encourage prosperity. Conversely, countries with extractive institutions, where elites control economic resources and political power, often experience stagnation and underdevelopment.

In their **2004 paper** _Institutions as a Fundamental Cause of Long-Run Growth_, written together by all three laureates, they further explore this idea by demonstrating how institutional differences can explain why certain countries experienced long-term growth while others did not. This study has been pivotal in shifting the focus of economic research toward the role of institutions in explaining growth disparities.

### The "Great Divergence" and Historical Context

Their work helps explain the **"Great Divergence"**, which refers to the widening gap in living standards between countries in the **East and West** following the **Industrial Revolution**. Prior to this period, living standards in various parts of the world were relatively similar. However, with the advent of industrialization, Western Europe and its offshoots saw rapid economic growth, while many other regions, particularly in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, lagged behind.

Various theories have been proposed to explain this divergence. Some attribute it to **Western colonialism**, which extracted resources from colonized regions, while others point to differences in **natural resource endowment** or **historical accidents**. However, Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson's research challenges these explanations, positing that **institutions**—and the ability to reform them—are the most significant factor.

### Conclusion

The **2024 Nobel laureates** have made an invaluable contribution to economics by emphasizing the role of institutions in shaping a country’s economic fate. Their research has shifted the understanding of global inequality and development by showing that inclusive, well-functioning institutions are essential for sustainable growth. This work has wide-ranging implications for policymakers, particularly in developing nations, as it highlights the importance of institutional reform in fostering long-term prosperity.

> The **2024 Nobel Prize in Economics** was awarded to **Daron Acemoglu**, **Simon Johnson**, and **James A. Robinson** for their research on how the quality of **institutions** affects national prosperity. Their work argues that countries with **inclusive political and economic institutions**, which allow for broad participation and protect property rights, are more likely to experience long-term economic growth. In contrast, **extractive institutions**, where power and wealth are concentrated in the hands of a few, lead to stagnation and underdevelopment. Their ideas are most famously articulated in the book **"Why Nations Fail"**, which explains global disparities in economic success.
