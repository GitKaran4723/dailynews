# The job crisis undermines state legitimacy

India faces a critical challenge in the form of inadequate quality job creation. A good quality job is more than just employment—it provides dignity, fair compensation, opportunities for learning, and the possibility of advancement for those willing to work hard. However, the current job market in India is failing to meet these standards, especially for its young population. Many jobs are unpaid, informal, and offer little to no growth, leaving workers stuck in dead-end positions with no prospects for improvement.

This issue is further exacerbated by India’s misleadingly low unemployment rate. Official statistics suggest that unemployment is relatively low, but this does not paint an accurate picture of the job market. The definition of “employment” includes anyone who has reported working for just one month in the entire year. As a result, many who are counted as employed may not have consistent, stable, or adequately paid work throughout the year. This underemployment—where people may have some work but not enough to sustain themselves or their families—remains a hidden crisis that is severely affecting large sections of the population.

The dearth of quality employment, particularly among India’s youth, is a growing problem that threatens not only the country’s economy but also its social and political stability. Young people, who make up a large portion of India’s population, are increasingly entering the job market, only to find that there are few opportunities for meaningful, long-term careers. This can lead to frustration, disillusionment, and social unrest, particularly as these young people struggle to achieve financial independence and security.

Without adequate job opportunities, many young Indians are forced into the informal sector, where they lack job security, fair wages, and basic benefits such as health insurance or retirement plans. These jobs are often temporary and exploitative, offering little room for growth or upward mobility. The lack of good jobs also creates a situation where skilled workers are underutilized, contributing to a growing sense of frustration among the youth.

This crisis is more than just an economic issue; it is a social and political one as well. If the government fails to create pathways for economic participation for its youth, it risks not only stalling economic growth but also undermining the very legitimacy of the state. A large population of disenfranchised young people without opportunities to participate meaningfully in society can lead to social unrest, as their frustrations manifest in protests, rising crime rates, or even radicalization in extreme cases.

Addressing this issue requires a multi-faceted approach. The government must focus on creating **quality jobs** that offer stable wages, social security, and opportunities for growth. This can be achieved through targeted investments in sectors with high job creation potential, such as technology, manufacturing, and green industries. It is also crucial to align education and skills development with the demands of the job market to ensure that young people are equipped with the skills they need for modern industries.

Additionally, local-level initiatives that focus on job creation in districts and rural areas could help spread economic opportunities more evenly across the country. These initiatives could include investments in infrastructure, promoting entrepreneurship, and providing incentives for businesses to create jobs in underserved regions. 

In conclusion, India’s job crisis, especially the lack of quality employment, is a pressing issue that threatens both the economy and the social fabric of the country. The government must act swiftly to create dignified, meaningful employment opportunities for its young population. Failure to do so could lead to severe consequences, not only in terms of economic stagnation but also in social unrest and loss of political legitimacy.

> India is facing a significant shortage of quality jobs, particularly for its youth, with many positions being unpaid, informal, or lacking growth opportunities. While official unemployment rates appear low, they mask widespread underemployment, where individuals work only briefly during the year. This lack of meaningful employment threatens not only the economy but also the social and political stability of the country. If the government fails to provide avenues for dignified and sustainable jobs, it risks fueling frustration and social unrest. To address this, India must focus on creating stable, well-paying jobs through targeted investments and better alignment between education and market needs.

# Working toward a meaningful ‘victims’ register’ in Bastar

The Home Minister’s recent meeting with victims of left-wing extremism, particularly Maoist violence, is a significant step in the government’s multi-pronged approach to addressing this long-standing issue. Seen in the context of the successes of the security forces in counter-Maoist operations over the past six months, the meeting reflects the government’s commitment to a more comprehensive strategy that goes beyond the traditional law-and-order response. This initiative highlights the seriousness with which the government is tackling the Maoist challenge and signals a shift towards a broader approach that encompasses security, development, community rights, governance, and public perception management.

### A Holistic Approach to Left-Wing Extremism

The government has long recognized that addressing the issue of left-wing extremism, particularly Maoist insurgency, requires more than just military or police operations. The Maoist movement, rooted in deep socio-economic grievances, thrives in regions where the state’s presence is weak and where local populations, especially marginalized communities, feel excluded from development and governance processes. For decades, these regions have suffered from a lack of basic infrastructure, education, healthcare, and economic opportunities, allowing Maoist groups to exploit these grievances.

The government’s declared approach to dealing with Maoism has been to address these underlying issues in a holistic manner. This involves focusing on security operations, yes, but also on ensuring development reaches affected areas, safeguarding the rights of local communities (particularly tribals), and improving governance structures. There is a recognition that to defeat Maoist insurgency, it is critical to win the trust and support of the local population, who are often caught between the Maoists and security forces.

### Recent Successes of Security Forces

In recent months, security forces have achieved notable successes in counter-Maoist operations, capturing or neutralizing key Maoist leaders and dismantling several of their strongholds in central and eastern India. These operations, led by a combination of central and state police forces, have weakened the operational capabilities of Maoist groups. The Home Minister’s meeting with the victims of Maoist violence serves as an acknowledgment of these successes and as an assurance that the government is working actively to protect citizens from further violence.

However, while the security forces' successes are commendable, there is a growing recognition that security operations alone are not sufficient. In regions like Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, and Odisha, where Maoist activity has been historically strong, long-term peace and stability will depend on addressing the deep-rooted socio-economic issues that fuel support for the Maoist cause.

### Challenges in Balancing Security and Development

Despite the declared holistic approach, the government’s actions have often been perceived as security-biased. While there have been efforts to develop infrastructure and promote economic opportunities in Maoist-affected areas, the pace of development has been slow, and the benefits have not always reached the most marginalized communities. For instance, large-scale infrastructure projects such as roads and bridges, while essential for economic development, sometimes trigger discontent among local populations if they are implemented without adequate consultation or consideration of local needs.

The government has also made efforts to ensure that local communities’ rights are protected, particularly in relation to land and forest resources. However, there are continuing tensions over land acquisition for industrial projects, which have sometimes been seen as prioritizing corporate interests over the rights of indigenous populations. These tensions can undermine the government’s attempts to win the hearts and minds of local communities, as they are seen to align with the grievances that Maoist groups exploit.

### Improving Governance and Public Perception

A crucial aspect of the government’s approach has been the improvement of governance and public perception. In Maoist-affected areas, governance structures have often been weak, with a lack of proper administration, corruption, and ineffective delivery of public services. To counter this, the government has made efforts to improve the quality of governance by increasing the presence of civil administration in remote areas, ensuring that basic services like healthcare and education are accessible, and promoting transparency and accountability in the local administration.

The government has also recognized the importance of managing public perception. Winning the trust of local communities involves not just improving security but also demonstrating that the state cares about their welfare and rights. This includes engaging in dialogue with local leaders, addressing their grievances, and involving them in the development process.

### Categories of those affected

However one needs to tread ahead with the policies and their implementation, with a caveat that victim identity is not a monolith in conflict zones — and Bastar is no different. Two main categories of victims among several, are, first the ones who have suffered at the hands of Maoists (and presumably these were the people who met the Home Minister). The second category of victims who cannot be ignored comprise those who have suffered at the hands of the state to include security forces and the criminal justice system; intentionally or otherwise.

Another agency that victimised the tribal community was the vigilante army called the Salwa Judum during the middle years of the first decade of this century. In this period, in addition to people who fled their villages to live in Salwa Judum camps (where they continue to live even after two decades), about 55,000 tribals fled Chhattisgarh to take shelter in then unified Andhra Pradesh. These internally displaced conflict victims yearn to return to Chhattisgarh but are yet to get redress from the respective State governments. In addition, there are numerous victims of structural violence churned up by the conflict since the 1980s, when Maoist cadres entered the forests of Dandakaranya, seeking safe haven. Dandakaranya covers an area of about 92,000 square kilometres and includes parts of Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra.

In fact the victimisation as a result of structural violence vis-à-vis tribal communities has been an ongoing process since colonial times and through the post-independence era. The Maoists, after entering Dandakaranya, sought to champion the tribal cause that was a manifestation of centuries of victimisation. Absent governance resulting from the policy of exclusion of tribal belts, gave tremendous elbow room to the Maoists to fill in the gap left by the state.

### Conclusion

While the successes of security forces in counter-Maoist operations are encouraging, the government must continue to pursue its holistic approach to addressing left-wing extremism. Security operations must be balanced with efforts to promote development, protect the rights of local communities, and improve governance. By engaging with victims of Maoist violence and demonstrating a commitment to a comprehensive strategy, the government is taking steps in the right direction. However, the challenge remains to ensure that these efforts are effectively implemented on the ground, not just through security interventions but through genuine development and governance improvements that address the root causes of the Maoist insurgency.

> The Home Minister's meeting with victims of Maoist violence reflects the government's commitment to a holistic approach in addressing left-wing extremism. While recent successes in security operations have weakened Maoist groups, the government emphasizes the need for more than just a law-and-order response. Its strategy includes focusing on development, protecting community rights, improving governance, and managing public perception. However, despite these efforts, the approach has often been seen as security-biased, with development initiatives slow to reach marginalized communities. To achieve long-term peace, the government must balance security with socio-economic improvements and better governance in affected regions.

# The world needs blue helmets who act as blue helmets

The United Nations (UN) has long been regarded as the global body committed to maintaining international peace and security. Its Charter, with strongly worded commitments to peace, combined with the deployment of over 100,000 peacekeepers in various conflict zones, provides the impression that the UN is well-equipped to eliminate wars and exploitation. Over its seven decades of peacekeeping, the UN has achieved remarkable success in numerous conflict areas. Examples include its peacekeeping operations in **Cambodia**, **Mozambique**, **Sierra Leone**, **Angola**, **Timor Leste**, **Liberia**, and **Kosovo**—conflicts where the UN played a decisive role in establishing peace and enabling post-conflict recovery. 

These successful engagements highlight the significant role of UN peace operations in stabilizing war-torn regions and facilitating the political transition to peaceful governance. For instance, in Cambodia, the UN’s role was instrumental in overseeing free elections and ensuring the end of decades of violence, while in Sierra Leone, it helped disarm rebels and foster national reconciliation. Such examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the UN’s political diplomacy and peacekeeping in certain contexts, providing hope that, with adequate resources and mandate, the UN can successfully contribute to world peace.

However, despite these successes, the UN has faced criticism for its failures in several major conflicts. Notably, in **Rwanda** (1994) and **Bosnia** (1995), the UN was accused of being a passive bystander, either unwilling or unable to protect vulnerable populations, particularly civilians, from mass atrocities. In Rwanda, the UN was heavily criticized for its failure to act decisively to prevent the genocide, which claimed nearly 800,000 lives in just a few months. Similarly, in Bosnia, the UN was faulted for not doing enough to protect civilians, particularly in **Srebrenica**, where over 8,000 Muslim men and boys were massacred despite the UN declaring the area a “safe zone.”

These failures tarnished the UN’s reputation and raised questions about its capacity and willingness to uphold its core values, particularly the **protection of civilians**. The inability to prevent these atrocities demonstrated the limitations of UN peacekeeping, especially when mandates are weak or when member states are unwilling to provide the necessary political support, resources, or military capabilities.

In response to these criticisms, the UN has made significant efforts to learn from its past failures. In subsequent missions, such as in **Sierra Leone** (UNSMIL), **Timor Leste** (UNMIT), **Darfur** (UNAMID), **South Sudan** (UNMISS), and the **Democratic Republic of Congo** (MONUSCO), the UN prioritized the protection of civilians as a central component of its peacekeeping operations. This shift marked a substantial, if not complete, restoration of the UN’s commitment to its core values of safeguarding vulnerable populations during conflicts.

In these later missions, the protection of civilians was brought to the forefront of the peacekeeping agenda, and the UN adopted a more proactive approach. For example, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, MONUSCO was given a robust mandate to neutralize armed groups and protect civilians, which represented a significant change in peacekeeping strategy. Similarly, in South Sudan, the UN established “Protection of Civilian” (POC) sites, where displaced populations could seek safety during times of conflict.

These actions indicate the UN’s willingness to use its **institutional memory** to improve its peacekeeping practices and evolve its strategies. By recognizing the importance of civilian protection and learning from previous mistakes, the UN has gradually regained its moral standing, although challenges remain.

### Conclusion
While the UN has made significant strides in peacekeeping, particularly in post-conflict societies like Cambodia and Sierra Leone, its failures in Rwanda and Bosnia show the limitations of its interventions. Nevertheless, the UN’s ability to adapt and improve, especially by prioritizing the protection of civilians in later missions, reflects its ongoing commitment to peace and security. Though not without flaws, the UN remains a crucial actor in global peacekeeping, learning from past experiences to enhance its future operations.

> The UN has achieved significant peacekeeping success in conflict zones like Cambodia, Sierra Leone, and Timor Leste, helping restore peace through political diplomacy and military operations. However, its failures in Rwanda (1994) and Bosnia (1995), where it failed to protect vulnerable civilians, notably women and children, highlighted its limitations. In response, the UN improved its peacekeeping strategies, prioritizing civilian protection in later missions like Sierra Leone (UNSMIL), South Sudan (UNMISS), and the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUSCO). These efforts reflect the UN’s commitment to learning from past mistakes and enhancing its peacekeeping effectiveness, despite ongoing challenges.

# Modi meets Putin, offers all help to end conflict

India has reiterated its support for the restoration of peace between Ukraine and Russia, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi emphasizing India’s commitment to providing “all possible assistance” to help end the ongoing crisis. This statement came during a bilateral meeting between Prime Minister Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday, on the sidelines of the 16th BRICS summit held in Kazan, Russia. The summit is taking place amid global conflicts, including those in Ukraine and the Gaza Strip, adding to the international community's calls for diplomatic solutions to these crises.

### India’s Neutral Stance and Diplomatic Engagement

India has maintained a delicate, neutral position on the Russia-Ukraine conflict, urging dialogue and diplomacy rather than taking sides. While India has historically had close ties with Russia, especially in defense and energy sectors, it has also sought to balance its relations with Western nations, many of whom have imposed sanctions on Russia due to its actions in Ukraine. Throughout the conflict, India has avoided directly condemning Russia, calling instead for an immediate cessation of violence and a peaceful resolution.

Prime Minister Modi’s recent statement during the meeting with President Putin underscores India’s consistent approach to fostering peace and stability. Modi highlighted India’s willingness to assist in ending the conflict, in line with India's foreign policy principles that advocate for peaceful coexistence and non-interference in internal matters. This aligns with India’s past calls for dialogue and peaceful negotiations, especially through multilateral platforms like the United Nations.

### Importance of the BRICS Summit

The BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) summit offers a significant opportunity for member countries to engage in discussions on pressing global issues. This year’s summit has been overshadowed by the conflicts in Ukraine and the Gaza Strip, as well as the broader geopolitical realignments that these conflicts have triggered.

During the summit, Prime Minister Modi and other leaders are expected to deliberate on various issues, including the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on global economic stability, food security, and energy markets. India, which has benefited from discounted Russian oil amid Western sanctions on Moscow, is carefully navigating its foreign policy to ensure it can maintain strong economic ties with both Russia and the West.

The BRICS summit also presents a platform for India to engage with Russia on security and strategic issues, while promoting the need for multilateralism and cooperative problem-solving on global conflicts. Prime Minister Modi’s meeting with President Putin reflects India’s proactive diplomacy in encouraging peace, not only in the context of Ukraine but in broader global issues as well.

### India’s Role in Mediating Global Conflicts

India’s emphasis on mediation and peace-building extends beyond the Ukraine-Russia conflict. As a significant global player with growing geopolitical influence, India has increasingly played a role in mediating international disputes. This was evident when India facilitated peace talks during the Afghan peace process, and it continues to offer its diplomatic services in other global hotspots, including in the Middle East.

India’s commitment to peace in the Ukraine-Russia conflict is consistent with its broader goals of becoming a responsible and neutral power in the international arena. By offering assistance to end the Ukraine crisis, India seeks to enhance its global standing as a mediator in conflict resolution, balancing its relations with all major global powers.

### Implications for India-Russia Relations

The meeting between Prime Minister Modi and President Putin also highlights the enduring strength of the India-Russia relationship, which is based on decades of strategic, military, and economic cooperation. While the Ukraine crisis has strained Russia’s relations with the West, India continues to maintain its ties with Russia, focusing on areas of mutual interest, including defense, energy, and trade.

Despite Western pressure, India has chosen a pragmatic approach, prioritizing its national interests while advocating for peaceful resolutions. India's position as a neutral party in the Ukraine conflict allows it to act as a potential bridge between Russia and the global community. Prime Minister Modi’s outreach to President Putin at the BRICS summit reaffirms India’s role in engaging with both Russia and other stakeholders to promote peace and stability.

### Conclusion

India’s call for the restoration of peace between Ukraine and Russia, as reiterated by Prime Minister Modi during his bilateral meeting with President Putin, demonstrates India’s continued commitment to diplomacy and peaceful conflict resolution. As the BRICS summit takes place amidst global tensions, India’s role as a neutral mediator is increasingly important. By offering to provide “all possible assistance” to end the Ukraine crisis, India is positioning itself as a responsible global actor, balancing its long-standing ties with Russia while promoting dialogue and peace on the international stage.

Modi emphasized India's willingness to provide “all possible assistance” to help end the conflict, underscoring India’s neutral stance and focus on diplomacy. The meeting highlighted India’s balancing act between maintaining strong ties with Russia and advocating for peaceful solutions. As the BRICS summit addresses global crises, India positions itself as a mediator, promoting dialogue and peaceful resolutions while reinforcing its role as a responsible global actor in conflict resolution.

# 16th BRICS Summit 

The **16th BRICS Summit**, held in **2024**, continues to mark the growing significance of the BRICS bloc, comprising **Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa**. As emerging economies with substantial influence on global affairs, the BRICS countries have collaborated over the years to foster economic, political, and cultural cooperation, providing a counterbalance to the influence of Western-dominated institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank. The 2024 summit, hosted by Russia in **Kazan**, came against the backdrop of ongoing global conflicts, economic challenges, and shifting geopolitical dynamics.

### Key Focus Areas of the Summit

1. **Economic Cooperation and Trade**:
   A significant focus of the 16th BRICS Summit was deepening economic cooperation among member states. Given the economic challenges posed by inflation, supply chain disruptions, and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the BRICS nations emphasized the need for stronger intra-BRICS trade. This includes reducing dependence on the U.S. dollar by expanding the use of local currencies in trade. BRICS countries have been exploring mechanisms to settle cross-border trade transactions in their own currencies, reducing the risks associated with currency volatility and fluctuations in global markets.

   Additionally, BRICS highlighted the importance of strengthening **South-South cooperation**, a framework of collaboration among developing countries to achieve economic growth and development. BRICS has been instrumental in setting up institutions like the **New Development Bank (NDB)** to provide infrastructure financing to developing nations, offering an alternative to Western financial institutions.

2. **Geopolitical Issues and Global Conflicts**:
   The summit occurred amid significant geopolitical tensions, including the ongoing **Russia-Ukraine conflict** and heightened instability in the Middle East, notably in the **Gaza Strip**. BRICS leaders emphasized the need for peaceful resolutions to these conflicts, advocating for diplomatic solutions over military action. Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India reiterated India’s stance of promoting dialogue and mediation to resolve the Russia-Ukraine crisis, while also expressing concern over the humanitarian impact of global conflicts.

   The BRICS countries underscored their collective desire to uphold multilateralism and the importance of international law, including the United Nations (UN) framework, as the basis for conflict resolution. They also expressed support for reforms in global institutions like the UN, where they seek greater representation for developing nations in decision-making processes.

3. **Climate Change and Sustainability**:
   Climate change remained a critical area of discussion at the summit. BRICS countries are at the forefront of both experiencing the adverse effects of climate change and contributing significantly to global emissions, particularly China and India. The summit reaffirmed the bloc’s commitment to the **Paris Agreement** and sustainable development goals, emphasizing the need for a balanced approach that allows for economic growth while addressing environmental concerns.

   The **BRICS countries** called for greater climate finance from developed nations, recognizing that the financial commitments made by the Global North in previous agreements remain largely unmet. The emphasis was on ensuring that developing nations have the resources to transition toward greener economies without compromising their developmental goals.

4. **Digital Transformation and Innovation**:
   Another major area of focus was **digital transformation** and innovation. Recognizing the importance of technology in driving economic growth, the BRICS nations discussed strategies to improve cooperation in fields such as artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and digital infrastructure. They explored ways to enhance digital governance and foster innovation ecosystems within their economies, aiming to reduce the digital divide and leverage technology for inclusive growth.

### Conclusion

The **16th BRICS Summit** showcased the bloc’s continued relevance in shaping global economic and geopolitical discourse. By focusing on economic cooperation, conflict resolution, climate action, and digital transformation, BRICS reiterated its commitment to providing alternative platforms for global cooperation, particularly for developing nations. The bloc’s emphasis on financial independence, climate resilience, and technological advancement points to a future where BRICS will continue to play a critical role in global governance. As challenges evolve, the group’s ability to collaborate effectively will be essential in addressing the shared issues faced by the Global South.

> The **16th BRICS Summit**, held in 2024 in Kazan, focused on strengthening economic cooperation, promoting peace, and addressing global challenges like climate change. Key discussions centered around enhancing trade among member states, reducing dependence on the U.S. dollar, and promoting the use of local currencies. Geopolitical tensions, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict and instability in the Middle East, were addressed with a call for peaceful resolutions.

# Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP): A Journey Towards Affordable Healthcare

The **Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP)** is a flagship program of the Government of India aimed at providing quality generic medicines to the masses at affordable prices. Launched in 2008 and later restructured in 2015, the PMBJP scheme is designed to reduce out-of-pocket healthcare expenditures for citizens, particularly for those from low-income backgrounds. It achieves this by making essential medicines available through a wide network of **Janaushadhi Kendras**, which are government-approved pharmacies.

### Objectives of PMBJP

The primary objective of the PMBJP is to provide affordable medicines to the public, especially the economically weaker sections of society. By offering **generic medicines**—which are identical in terms of quality, efficacy, and safety to their branded counterparts but available at significantly lower prices—the scheme helps bridge the gap in healthcare access. Generic medicines sold through the scheme are typically 50-90% cheaper than branded ones, making healthcare more accessible.

Other objectives include:
- **Promoting the use of generic medicines** over costly branded versions.
- **Enhancing awareness** among the public about the benefits of generic medicines.
- **Creating job opportunities** by establishing Janaushadhi Kendras across the country.

### Growth and Reach

The PMBJP has witnessed significant growth over the years, expanding its reach to underserved and rural areas. As of 2024, more than **9,000 Janaushadhi Kendras** are operational across the country, covering both urban and rural areas. These stores stock a wide range of medicines, covering more than 1,600 medicines and over 250 surgical and medical devices.

To ensure the quality of medicines, the PMBJP sources its products from reputed pharmaceutical manufacturers who are certified by the World Health Organization's Good Manufacturing Practices (WHO-GMP) standards. The quality control process ensures that the generic medicines available at Janaushadhi Kendras meet the highest standards of safety and efficacy.

### Impact on Healthcare

The PMBJP has made a tangible impact on India's healthcare sector, particularly by making essential medicines more affordable for millions of people. By providing cost-effective medicines, the scheme has helped reduce the financial burden on families who might otherwise struggle to afford high-priced branded medicines. This is especially crucial for patients suffering from chronic diseases, where the continuous purchase of medication can be financially draining.

The scheme has also played a pivotal role during the **COVID-19 pandemic**, providing affordable healthcare products such as **sanitizers, masks, and essential medicines** to the public. During this period, the demand for Janaushadhi medicines increased substantially, reflecting the scheme's importance in times of public health crises.

### Challenges and Future Prospects

Despite its success, PMBJP faces challenges. One of the main issues is the **awareness gap** among the public. Many people are still not fully aware of the availability or the benefits of generic medicines, preferring branded versions due to misconceptions about their quality. Furthermore, some areas, particularly in remote regions, still lack sufficient Janaushadhi Kendras, limiting access to affordable medicines.

To address these challenges, the government is working on further expanding the network of Janaushadhi Kendras and increasing awareness campaigns to educate the public on the quality and benefits of generic medicines. Efforts are also being made to partner with local entrepreneurs and NGOs to spread the program’s reach to every corner of the country.

### Conclusion

The **Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana** has been a significant step towards ensuring affordable healthcare for all Indians. By offering high-quality generic medicines at low prices, it has reduced healthcare costs and made essential drugs more accessible. The scheme's expansion, coupled with awareness campaigns, can further enhance its impact, bringing affordable healthcare to even the most underserved regions of the country. As the PMBJP continues to grow, it holds great promise in transforming India's healthcare landscape by promoting a more inclusive and affordable healthcare system for all.

> The **Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP)** aims to provide affordable, quality generic medicines to the public, especially the economically disadvantaged. Launched in 2008 and expanded in 2015, the scheme has established over **9,000 Janaushadhi Kendras** across India, offering essential medicines at significantly lower prices than branded counterparts. By reducing healthcare costs, particularly for chronic illness patients, PMBJP has improved access to medication. Despite its success, challenges remain in raising public awareness and expanding coverage in remote areas. The scheme is a crucial step toward making healthcare more inclusive and affordable, contributing to a healthier India.
