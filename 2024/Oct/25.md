# Meal costs are rising higher than earnings? Implication on India and people

Rising meal costs exceeding income growth has significant implications for India, affecting both the economy and the daily lives of its people. Key impacts include the following:

### 1. **Strain on Household Budgets**
   - With food costs increasing faster than earnings, particularly for staple items like vegetables, grains, and cooking oils, household budgets are under pressure. Low-income and middle-income families, who spend a significant portion of their income on food, are especially impacted. Rising meal costs force families to either reduce the quality and quantity of food or divert funds from other essential areas like healthcare, education, and savings, potentially increasing malnutrition and poverty levels.

### 2. **Increased Poverty and Food Insecurity**
   - Food inflation directly affects food security, pushing vulnerable populations into hunger and malnutrition. In India, where millions already live close to the poverty line, the inability to afford sufficient, nutritious food has severe repercussions for health, particularly for children and elderly populations. This situation is exacerbated by India’s high levels of food insecurity, as per the Global Hunger Index, where escalating costs could push more households into severe food insecurity.

### 3. **Impact on the Workforce and Productivity**
   - Rising meal costs and constrained budgets can lead to reduced nutritional intake, directly impacting workers’ health, productivity, and overall well-being. Nutrition is crucial for physical stamina and cognitive performance, particularly for labor-intensive jobs. Poor nutrition in the working-age population can lead to decreased productivity and potential long-term health issues, impacting the nation’s workforce quality.

### 4. **Social and Economic Inequality**
   - Food inflation can widen the gap between income groups, as wealthier households are better able to absorb rising costs than low-income households. This can further increase economic disparity, with low-income families bearing the brunt of inflationary pressures. In rural areas where employment is primarily informal and wages are lower, the impact is even more severe, potentially leading to increased migration to urban areas in search of better income opportunities.

### 5. **Pressure on Policy and Government Spending**
   - The government may face increased pressure to implement or expand food subsidy programs like the **Public Distribution System (PDS)** or **free meal schemes** to cushion the effects of rising food prices. While helpful, these programs can strain public finances, potentially leading to increased budget deficits or reallocation of funds from other developmental programs. The government might also consider import adjustments or price controls, but these measures can have mixed results and could affect local agricultural producers.

### 6. **Impact on Small Businesses and Agriculture**
   - Small restaurants, eateries, and food vendors are likely to face challenges as rising ingredient costs reduce profit margins, forcing them to either increase prices or absorb the losses, which may lead to reduced customer demand. Farmers, on the other hand, may face volatile input costs (such as fuel and fertilizer) that do not necessarily translate into higher returns, putting further stress on the agricultural sector.

### Conclusion

In summary, the implications of rising meal costs surpassing earnings growth are widespread, affecting household food security, increasing poverty, widening inequality, and placing pressure on the government for intervention. This situation calls for a multi-faceted approach, including agricultural policy adjustments, enhanced social safety nets, and effective inflation management to prevent long-term economic and social repercussions in India.

> Rising meal costs outpacing earnings in India impacts households, the economy, and public policy. Families, particularly low- and middle-income ones, face strained budgets, often reducing food quality or quantity to manage rising prices, leading to increased malnutrition risks. The situation exacerbates food insecurity and poverty, especially in rural areas. With lower purchasing power, the workforce’s nutrition and productivity also suffer, impacting national output. Economic disparity widens as low-income groups struggle more than wealthier ones, while small businesses face reduced demand. The government may need to expand subsidies or social programs, increasing fiscal pressure and affecting other developmental spending.

# Move on madrasas, the alienation of Muslims

The Supreme Court of India recently intervened to stay recommendations from the **National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR)** aimed at cutting off government funding for madrasas non-compliant with the **Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009** and inspecting all madrasas across the country. This decision provides relief to minorities and secularists concerned about potential bias and repercussions on religious minorities. Despite this stay, concerns remain regarding the implications for secularism and minority rights in India, especially in light of the ideological influences behind such moves.

### The concept and history

The NCPCR further demands that children belonging to other religious groups should be thrown out of madrasas. It would be like “throwing the baby out with the bath water”, as cited now by the Supreme Court. According to the NCPCR, it is proved that many children belonging to other religious groups are also going to the madrasas. Why did it happen? It is difficult for anybody familiar with the experiences of the real Kerala story, a State that succeeded in the universalisation of public education, to understand this scenario. Primary education is not accessible to all in this country before and even after the enactment of the RTE Act, 2009. That is why a system has emerged of imparting secular education along with religious instructions and the government was compelled to provide financial assistance for the same in many States. The NCPCR has failed to understand this reality.

The training centres started by the ultra-terrorist Taliban in the late 1970s, under the patronage of the United States to overthrow the leftist government in Afghanistan, were later named as madrasas. It was deliberate propaganda which fits the present Islamophobic narrative put forward by the same U.S. and its imperial allies. However, the concept is inconsistent with the realities of Indian history and society. The Arabic word ‘madrasa’ means school and nothing else. And this name was used for long for both the religious and the secular schools till the introduction of the distinct system of colonial education by the British regime. In the absence of a free and universal education system, many non-Muslim children depended on madrasas. Raja Ram Mohan Roy, the father of the Indian Renaissance, Rajendra Prasad, the first President of India, and the writer Munshi Premchand and many others absorbed the early rays of knowledge from madrasas and maulvis. This historical fact may be offensive to Hindutva communalists. The hatemongers of our time may not like to establish that India’s history is not one of competition and confrontation but one of coexistence and tolerance. While it is hard to stand up and speak the truth in today’s hateful discourse, it cannot be left unsaid.

The madrasa system prevailed since the days of the Delhi Sultanate and was patronised by slave, Khilji and Tughlaq dynasties. From the travelogues of Ibn Battuta, a Moroccan traveller, it is evident that Firoz Shah Tughlaq (1309-1388), the successor of the Muhammad-bin Tughlaq, instrumentalised this practice to educate women and slaves in the arts, science and handicrafts. Later, in various regions of India, and particularly in Kerala, Christian denominations widely established schools next to churches not only for the children of their own community but also for those who wanted to learn. It was not seen as a shame to get knowledge from anyone, even from those belonging to a different faith.

### Social justice and not appeasement

Kerala has been a target of venomous attack in recent years, through fake and fabricated news, for the only fault of upholding solidarity and communal amity among all sections of the society despite attempts to promote hate and mistrust from various corners. The issue related to the functioning of madrasas is no exception. What is the truth? As a State that has an exemplary system of primary education, Kerala does not need to run madrasas with financial assistance from the government. Dissemination of fake news that the Government of Kerala is spending a huge amount on madrasas is simply untrue. But the Madrasa Teachers’ Welfare Fund, the financial source of pension and other benefits, is statutorily established akin to that of other categories of employees. It is based on the policy of social justice and not of religious appeasement.

Freedom of religion is constitutional. Article 25 guarantees every Indian citizen the freedom to profess, practise and propagate the religion of their choice. The government has the power to prevent anything illegal and detrimental to national security. Be it religious or secular schools, all should operate as in the guidance of the law. But the action of the NCPCR, fuelling the alienation of religious minorities, does show justice neither to the Child Rights Act nor to the country.

### An aggressive majoritarianism

In a country such as ours, imparting secular values to upcoming generations is of paramount importance. The existence and the growth of India depend upon its unity in diversity. Religious leaders and people belonging to all faiths will understand the pluralistic content of this great nation. That can be inculcated by following the teachings of the great leaders of all streams irrespective of their religion. In this context, the words of Sree Narayana Guru are worth remembering: “Sarvamatha Saravum Ekam (Essence of all religions is one and the same)”.

### Background of the NCPCR Recommendations

The NCPCR, a statutory body focused on child rights, recommended that government funding should be halted for madrasas that do not adhere to the RTE Act's mandates, which include universal access to formal education and specific standards for teacher qualifications, infrastructure, and curriculum. Madrasas, many of which focus on religious education, often operate outside the conventional schooling system and may not meet RTE requirements. The NCPCR's recommendations suggested enforcing stricter oversight and compliance, sparking apprehension among those who perceive this move as an infringement on cultural and educational autonomy.

### Ideological Underpinnings and Criticisms

Critics argue that the recommendations by the NCPCR may be ideologically motivated, allegedly drawing inspiration from **M.S. Golwalkar’s "Bunch of Thoughts,"** a book that has influenced certain nationalist ideologies in India. Golwalkar’s work has been controversial, particularly in its characterization of religious minorities and the impact of such ideologies on national unity. Opponents of the NCPCR’s stance, including **Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) leader A.K. Bajpai**, assert that even members within the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) recognize the potential dangers of this initiative. Such voices caution that targeting madrasas may create tensions with the nation’s commitment to secularism, potentially alienating minority communities.

### Implications for Minority Education and Rights

The potential defunding and inspection of madrasas could have wide-reaching consequences for the educational opportunities available to Muslim students, particularly in regions where such institutions are essential due to limited public schooling options. Madrasas have traditionally played a role in providing basic education and religious instruction, especially for students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. By linking government funding to RTE compliance, the NCPCR’s recommendations could pressurize these institutions into adopting secular curricula at the cost of their religious and cultural focus, effectively compromising their educational autonomy.

### Legal and Secular Concerns

The Supreme Court’s stay on these recommendations highlights the judiciary’s recognition of the need for balanced oversight. The RTE Act, while ensuring access to quality education, must be applied uniformly, considering the country’s pluralistic and secular constitution. The stay provides temporary relief to minority communities, affirming their right to practice and propagate religious education without disproportionate interference from the state. However, the stay also raises broader questions about the extent to which religious educational institutions should adhere to standardized educational requirements.

### Broader Socio-Political Reactions

The debate over NCPCR’s recommendations has also stirred reactions within political circles, with some viewing it as a step toward cultural homogenization that undermines India’s secular and inclusive character. Opposition leaders and rights groups have voiced concerns about minority rights and the preservation of secularism. This issue reflects a broader discourse on balancing modern education standards with the rights of religious institutions to maintain their traditional values and curriculum focus.

### Conclusion

The Supreme Court’s intervention offers temporary relief, signaling the importance of cautious and equitable governance when dealing with religious and educational institutions. It underscores the need for policy that respects diversity while upholding educational standards. This case also serves as a reminder of the judiciary’s role in safeguarding minority rights within a secular framework, essential for maintaining India’s cultural and religious pluralism.

The **National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR)** made several key recommendations regarding madrasas in India, focusing on compliance with the **Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009** and ensuring educational standards. Here are the main points of their recommendations:

1. **Withdrawal of Government Funding for Non-Compliant Madrasas**: NCPCR recommended halting government funding to madrasas that do not adhere to RTE norms. This includes madrasas that do not meet the criteria for qualified teachers, infrastructure, and a secular curriculum as mandated by the RTE Act.

2. **Inspection of Madrasa Operations**: The NCPCR proposed conducting inspections of madrasas across India to ensure that they meet RTE standards and provide students with access to quality, standardized education. The commission also expressed concerns about some madrasas potentially focusing solely on religious instruction without incorporating broader academic subjects.

3. **Mainstreaming of Madrasa Students**: To facilitate mainstream educational opportunities, NCPCR recommended integrating madrasa students into formal education systems. This includes offering madrasas the option to follow a curriculum aligned with mainstream education, which would enable students to gain skills that can provide better future job prospects.

4. **Protection of Child Rights and Safety**: NCPCR expressed concerns about child rights and safety in madrasas, suggesting that these institutions adhere to child protection policies and create safer environments for students. This includes adequate teacher-student ratios, safe infrastructure, and oversight of teaching practices.

These recommendations have generated discussions regarding educational autonomy and the role of religious institutions in secular education. The Supreme Court recently stayed these recommendations, citing the need to balance RTE compliance with respect for cultural and religious diversity in educational institutions.

> The **National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR)** recommended that government funding for madrasas be withdrawn if they don’t comply with the **Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009**. NCPCR’s proposal includes mandatory inspections of madrasas to ensure they meet RTE standards, including infrastructure and curriculum requirements, and urges madrasas to introduce secular subjects to align with mainstream education. It also emphasizes child safety policies and protective measures. Critics see these moves as an infringement on religious educational autonomy, while supporters argue it promotes equitable educational standards and opportunities for madrasa students in the mainstream economy.
