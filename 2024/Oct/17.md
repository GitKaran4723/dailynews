# Centre increases MSP for wheat, five other rabi crops

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) announced a significant increase in the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for rabi crops for the 2025-26 marketing season. The most notable change was the ₹150 hike per quintal for wheat, raising the MSP from ₹2,275 per quintal in 2024-25 to ₹2,425 per quintal for the upcoming season. This adjustment is a clear indication of the government's focus on ensuring that farmers receive a fair and remunerative price for their produce.

The MSP system is a critical part of the Indian agricultural policy framework, designed to safeguard farmers from price fluctuations and provide them with a guaranteed price for their crops. It helps in mitigating the risks associated with the agricultural market, which can be highly volatile due to factors such as climate conditions, demand and supply imbalances, and global market trends.

### Rabi Crops and the Importance of MSP

Rabi crops, primarily grown during the winter season, include wheat, barley, gram (chickpeas), lentil (masoor), rapeseed and mustard, and safflower. These crops play a crucial role in the Indian agricultural economy and are essential for food security. Wheat, in particular, is the staple food for a significant portion of the Indian population.

The government’s move to increase the MSP for these crops reflects its commitment to ensuring that farmers remain motivated to continue cultivating them. According to the announcement, the MSP for rabi crops for 2025-26 is set between 50% and 105% above the production cost. This percentage ensures that farmers are not only compensated for their efforts but also receive a profit margin that enables them to continue investing in farming.

### Breakdown of MSP Hike

The Union Agriculture Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan emphasized the government's efforts to support farmers. Apart from wheat, the other rabi crops also saw significant MSP increases. This hike is part of a broader effort by the Narendra Modi-led government to enhance farmers' welfare, with the goal of doubling farmers' incomes.

For the 2025-26 season, the MSP hikes for rabi crops are as follows:

- **Wheat**: ₹2,425 per quintal, up from ₹2,275.
- **Barley**: ₹1,805 per quintal.
- **Gram (Chickpeas)**: ₹5,440 per quintal.
- **Lentil (Masoor)**: ₹6,425 per quintal.
- **Rapeseed and Mustard**: ₹5,750 per quintal.
- **Safflower**: ₹6,120 per quintal.

These MSP increases are designed to ensure that farmers who grow these crops benefit from better returns, encouraging them to maintain or increase production levels. 

### Government's Commitment to Farmers' Welfare

The government has repeatedly emphasized its commitment to farmers' welfare through policies that protect and uplift the agricultural community. The regular revision of the MSP, coupled with initiatives such as soil health cards, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (crop insurance scheme), and improved irrigation infrastructure, reflects a comprehensive approach to strengthening the agricultural sector. 

The MSP increase, especially for a staple crop like wheat, will provide farmers with the financial support needed to cover rising input costs such as fertilizers, seeds, and labor. It also helps in stabilizing farm incomes, allowing farmers to continue their essential role in feeding the nation.

### Impact on Farmers and the Economy

The higher MSP can have multiple positive impacts on the economy. First, it incentivizes farmers to grow more, contributing to higher food production and security. Second, by ensuring better incomes for farmers, it can lead to an increase in rural spending, which could boost demand in the rural economy. Third, it reduces the likelihood of farmers falling into debt or abandoning farming altogether due to financial losses.

However, there are also challenges. While the MSP increases will benefit farmers, ensuring that they actually receive these prices remains a challenge. A significant proportion of farmers sell their produce in the open market, where prices may fall below the MSP. To address this, the government must ensure that procurement agencies are active in all regions, particularly those where farmers face difficulties in accessing markets.

### Conclusion

The increase in the MSP for rabi crops for the 2025-26 marketing season is a welcome move for the agricultural community, especially given the rising input costs and market volatility. The Narendra Modi government's focus on improving the welfare of farmers through policies like MSP hikes is evident, and this move aligns with its broader vision of making agriculture more sustainable and profitable.

This steady increase in MSP also reassures farmers that the government is attentive to their needs, especially in a sector where income stability is often uncertain. However, the challenge remains in ensuring effective implementation of the MSP system so that all farmers, especially small and marginal ones, can benefit from the increased prices.

### Minimum Support Price (MSP): Detailed Explanation

**Introduction:**
The Minimum Support Price (MSP) is a policy instrument used by the Indian government to provide a guaranteed price for certain agricultural crops, ensuring farmers a minimum profit over their cost of production. This system aims to protect farmers from sharp declines in market prices due to various factors such as bumper production, global market fluctuations, or unfair trading practices. The MSP is set by the government and acts as a safety net, ensuring that farmers earn a stable income for their produce.

### Key Features of MSP:

1. **Price Guarantee:**
   MSP serves as a form of insurance for farmers by assuring them a fixed price for their crops, regardless of market conditions. If the market price falls below the MSP, government agencies step in to purchase the crops at the declared MSP.

2. **Crops Covered:**
   MSP is announced for 23 major crops in India. These include food grains, pulses, oilseeds, and certain commercial crops. The crops are divided into two main categories:
   - **Kharif crops** (sown in monsoon season): rice, maize, bajra, jowar, pulses like tur, moong, and urad.
   - **Rabi crops** (sown in the winter season): wheat, barley, gram, lentil (masoor), rapeseed and mustard, and safflower.

3. **Purpose of MSP:**
   - **Income Support:** It ensures that farmers receive a minimum profit for their crops, which helps them cover production costs and provides a stable income.
   - **Incentivizes Production:** By offering MSP, the government encourages farmers to cultivate certain crops, which helps ensure food security by maintaining sufficient production levels.
   - **Protection from Market Fluctuations:** MSP shields farmers from falling prices in the open market due to excess supply or other unfavorable conditions.

### How is MSP Determined?

The MSP for various crops is recommended by the **Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP)**, which considers a variety of factors before making its recommendation to the government. The final decision is made by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA). 

Key factors influencing MSP determination include:
1. **Cost of Production:** The MSP is typically set above the average cost of production to ensure a reasonable profit for farmers.
2. **Supply and Demand:** The overall supply and demand conditions for a crop in the domestic and international markets are considered.
3. **Price Trends in Domestic and Global Markets:** Trends in market prices, both domestic and international, help in deciding MSP.
4. **Intercrop Price Parity:** MSP is set in such a way that it ensures a balance between different crops, so farmers are not disproportionately incentivized to grow one crop over another.
5. **Terms of Trade Between Agriculture and Non-Agriculture Sectors:** MSP also considers the relative profitability of agriculture vis-à-vis other sectors of the economy.
6. **Impact on Consumers and Inflation:** While setting MSP, the government also takes into account its potential impact on consumer prices and inflation.

### Rationale Behind MSP Hikes for Rabi Crops 2025-26:

In October 2023, the Indian government announced an increase in the MSP for six rabi crops for the 2025-26 marketing season. The MSP increase for wheat was particularly notable, with a hike of ₹150 per quintal, raising it to ₹2,425 per quintal from ₹2,275 for the previous season.

Key reasons for these MSP hikes include:
1. **Compensating for Rising Input Costs:** Over time, the cost of inputs such as fertilizers, seeds, irrigation, and labor has increased. The MSP hikes aim to compensate for these rising costs, ensuring that farmers do not suffer financially.
2. **Encouraging Rabi Crop Production:** Increasing the MSP incentivizes farmers to sow more rabi crops like wheat, barley, gram, lentil, rapeseed, mustard, and safflower. This helps ensure sufficient production levels to meet the country’s food security needs.
3. **Enhancing Farmers’ Income:** By setting MSP significantly above the cost of production (50% to 105% in this case), the government aims to boost the income of farmers, thereby contributing to their overall economic welfare.
4. **Strengthening Agriculture Sector:** Ensuring remunerative prices for rabi crops is part of the government’s broader strategy to improve the agricultural sector's health and enhance farmers' livelihoods.

### Challenges with MSP:

While MSP offers many benefits, there are also several challenges associated with its implementation:
1. **Limited Reach:** Only a fraction of farmers, mainly in states like Punjab, Haryana, and Madhya Pradesh, benefit directly from MSP through government procurement. In other regions, many farmers are forced to sell their produce in the open market where prices may be lower than MSP.
2. **Procurement Infrastructure:** There are inadequate procurement facilities in several parts of the country, making it difficult for all farmers to sell their produce at MSP.
3. **Market Inefficiencies:** In the absence of a robust market infrastructure, MSP often remains theoretical for many farmers, who are unable to sell their crops at the guaranteed price.
4. **Subsidy Burden:** Continuous procurement at high MSP levels can lead to an increased subsidy burden on the government, contributing to fiscal deficits.

### Conclusion:

The Minimum Support Price (MSP) is a vital mechanism in India’s agricultural policy framework, aimed at protecting farmers' incomes and ensuring food security. The recent hike in MSP for rabi crops for the 2025-26 season demonstrates the government’s commitment to supporting the agricultural sector. However, ensuring effective implementation, expanding procurement infrastructure, and addressing the challenges of market access remain critical for maximizing the benefits of MSP for all farmers across the country.

The Minimum Support Price (MSP) system is a critical policy tool that provides direct benefits to farmers, ensuring they receive a guaranteed price for their crops. While it has traditionally had a significant impact on certain staple crops like wheat and rice, its extension to other crops offers several important benefits:

### 1. **Encouraging Crop Diversification:**
   - **Current Scenario:** In states like Punjab and Haryana, farmers tend to focus heavily on wheat and rice due to the guaranteed MSP and robust procurement system. This has led to over-reliance on a few crops, resulting in issues like water scarcity (especially with rice) and soil degradation.
   - **How MSP Helps:** By offering attractive MSPs for other crops like pulses (gram, lentils), oilseeds (mustard, rapeseed, safflower), and coarse grains (barley, maize, millet), the government incentivizes farmers to diversify their crop choices. This can reduce pressure on natural resources and promote more sustainable agricultural practices.

### 2. **Increasing Farmers' Income:**
   - **Current Scenario:** Farmers who grow crops that are not as commonly procured (such as pulses, oilseeds, and coarse cereals) often suffer from unstable market prices. Without the assurance of MSP, they are vulnerable to price fluctuations caused by surplus production or market dynamics.
   - **How MSP Helps:** Extending MSP to a broader range of crops ensures that farmers growing these crops receive a fair and guaranteed price. For instance, if farmers grow gram or mustard, they are now assured that they will receive a reasonable return even if market prices fall. This helps stabilize their income and reduces the risk of financial losses.

### 3. **Ensuring Food and Nutritional Security:**
   - **Current Scenario:** India's agricultural production is often skewed towards food grains like wheat and rice, which are staple foods but lack essential nutrients like protein and healthy fats.
   - **How MSP Helps:** Encouraging the production of pulses and oilseeds through MSP helps improve the overall food security in India. Pulses are rich in protein, and oilseeds are important for healthy fats. By supporting these crops, the MSP policy contributes to a more balanced and nutritious food supply, promoting public health and addressing malnutrition.

### 4. **Promoting Self-Sufficiency in Essential Crops:**
   - **Current Scenario:** India imports a large quantity of pulses and edible oils to meet domestic demand. This dependency on imports can make the country vulnerable to global price fluctuations.
   - **How MSP Helps:** Increasing the MSP for pulses (like gram and lentils) and oilseeds (like mustard and safflower) encourages domestic production, reducing the need for imports. By supporting farmers in producing these essential crops, India can move closer to self-sufficiency and reduce its dependence on international markets.

### 5. **Reducing Price Volatility for Farmers:**
   - **Current Scenario:** Market prices for non-MSP crops are highly volatile and dependent on market demand, weather conditions, and production levels. Without MSP, farmers growing these crops face high financial uncertainty.
   - **How MSP Helps:** MSP provides a safety net for farmers by stabilizing the prices of various crops. Even in years of surplus production, when market prices may crash, farmers know they can still sell their crops at the MSP, protecting them from huge financial losses. This security encourages farmers to invest in growing a wider variety of crops.

### 6. **Supporting Marginal and Small Farmers:**
   - **Current Scenario:** Small and marginal farmers, who often grow non-MSP crops like pulses and oilseeds, face significant market risks. Due to their small landholdings, they have limited capacity to absorb price shocks.
   - **How MSP Helps:** Expanding MSP to cover more crops helps small and marginal farmers by ensuring they have a guaranteed buyer for their produce at a fair price. This income security can be life-changing for small farmers, enabling them to invest in better inputs, technology, and their families' well-being.

### 7. **Contributing to Rural Economic Growth:**
   - **Current Scenario:** A limited focus on only a few crops in the MSP system results in concentrated growth in certain regions, leaving others behind. For example, areas heavily dependent on pulses or oilseeds have not seen the same government support as wheat- and rice-growing regions.
   - **How MSP Helps:** Extending MSP to a broader range of crops benefits a larger portion of the farming population across different regions of India. This not only improves the livelihood of farmers but also boosts rural economic growth by increasing cash flow in these areas. When farmers earn more, they spend more in local markets, which drives economic development in rural regions.

### 8. **Reducing Regional Crop Imbalances:**
   - **Current Scenario:** The dominance of rice and wheat in the MSP and procurement systems has led to regional imbalances. States like Punjab and Haryana over-produce wheat and rice, whereas states that grow pulses and oilseeds, like Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, may not see the same benefits.
   - **How MSP Helps:** Expanding MSP to crops like pulses and oilseeds ensures that states growing these crops also receive government support. This leads to a more balanced agricultural policy that benefits all regions of the country, rather than just wheat- and rice-producing states.

### 9. **Ensuring Sustainability and Environmental Protection:**
   - **Current Scenario:** Monoculture of wheat and rice, incentivized by MSP, has resulted in soil degradation, declining water tables, and loss of biodiversity. It also leads to overuse of chemical fertilizers and pesticides.
   - **How MSP Helps:** Encouraging farmers to grow other crops such as pulses and oilseeds through MSP reduces the environmental strain caused by the over-cultivation of wheat and rice. Pulses, for instance, are nitrogen-fixing crops that improve soil fertility and require less water, making them more environmentally sustainable. Similarly, oilseeds are typically grown in rain-fed regions and require fewer chemical inputs.

### Conclusion:

Expanding the MSP to other crops has a wide range of benefits, both for farmers and the broader agricultural ecosystem. It encourages crop diversification, ensures income stability, promotes sustainability, and contributes to food security. By providing a guaranteed price for more crops, the MSP policy can help balance regional agricultural development, promote self-sufficiency in critical crops, and protect small and marginal farmers from market fluctuations. However, effective implementation, including improving procurement systems and market infrastructure, is necessary to fully realize these benefits for all farmers.

> The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs has raised the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for rabi crops for the 2025-26 season, with wheat seeing a ₹150 increase per quintal, now set at ₹2,425. MSP hikes for six rabi crops, including barley, gram, lentil, rapeseed, mustard, and safflower, range between 50% and 105% above production costs. This move reflects the government’s commitment to farmers’ welfare, ensuring better returns for crops. While the MSP increases aim to improve farm incomes and encourage production, effective implementation remains crucial to ensure farmers receive these prices.

# The Lady Justice Statue

The newly unveiled **Lady Justice** statue at India's Supreme Court symbolizes a shift from colonial traditions to modern values, emphasizing constitutional justice, awareness, and inclusivity. With **open eyes** and a **Constitution replacing the sword**, it marks a significant transformation under Chief Justice DY Chandrachud's leadership.

Here are the key differences between the old and new statues:

| **Feature**                    | **Old Statue**                                     | **New Statue**                                                |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Blindfold**                   | Present, symbolizing impartiality                 | Removed, indicating that "the law is not blind"               |
| **Eyes**                        | Closed, reinforcing the blindfold's symbolism     | Open, suggesting awareness and understanding                  |
| **Item Held in Left Hand**      | Sword, representing punishment and authority      | Constitution, symbolizing justice based on constitutional values |
| **Attire**                      | Traditional Western robe                         | Indian saree, reflecting cultural identity                    |
| **Symbolism of Scales**          | Represented balance and fairness                 | Remains unchanged, still symbolizing impartiality             |

### Symbolic Changes
**Removing the Blindfold**: This ancient blindfolded statue, representing that justice should not be blind to passion or influence from outside sources like wealth or status was viewed to have been removed-the current view is justice knows all and sees everything of its status.
**Constitution vs. Sword**: The sword in the old statue symbolizes the power to enforce law and punishment. The new statue holding the Constitution focuses on justice with a constitutional foundation, pertinent to the changing legal structure of India.
**Attire**: This is a transformation from the trends of the Western robe dress code to donning an Indian saree - an aspect that shows a larger transition toward assuming the Indian identity in the judicial institution.
**Open Eyes**: The old statue has open eyes. This would illustrate that this is coming up with proactive justice that knows the problems in society but fights for fairness instead of equality.
These changes were initiated under Chief Justice DY Chandrachud's leadership, aiming to modernize the judiciary and move away from colonial legacies.

The open-eyed Lady Justice statue at the Supreme Court of India signifies a transformative view of justice's role in society, reflecting modern values and principles. 

### Significance of Open Eyes
**Awareness and Engagement**: Open eyes symbolize knowledge about the complexity and differentiation within society. The image would then contrast for it is, in a way, an icon of detached impartiality.
**Constitutional Focus**: The statue holds the Constitution in her hand rather than a sword, much as to indicate that justice is deep-rooted into constitutional values rather than punishment. Shifting from such practices showed a commitment to uphold rights and fairness in the eye of the Constitution against symbols of colonial authority and violence.
**Inclusivity and Fairness**: The design has a more inclusive aspect toward justice, meaning that it is supposed to take aboard different viewpoints and experiences instead of ascribing everyone as same in the eyes of the law. This is at par with what Chief Justice DY Chandrachud holds forth and his claim that "the law is not blind; it sees everyone equally," legal identity evolving into one that grants equality and fairness.
**Rejection of the Colonial Legacy**: The renovation is a purposeful act that seeks to move away from manifestations of the colonial era. Adopting an understanding of justice that would strictly be Indian, the statue represented an allegiance to the institutionalization of a modern legal system that would align instead with societal values as it stand today.
**Balance and Integrity**: Where the sword was displaced by the scales of justice, this goes to prove that its post-replacement alternative represents a continued dedication to balance and fairness in judicial decisions. This helps underscore that courts will continue weighing evidence impartially, hearing all parties' voices before making any decision before it.
Overall, the open-eyed Lady Justice represents an enlightened approach to justice in India that is vigilant, inclusive, and deeply rooted in constitutional principles rather than old-fashioned ideas about blind impartiality.

> The new Lady Justice statue differs significantly from the traditional version. The old statue had a blindfold, symbolizing impartiality, while the new version has no blindfold, indicating that "the law is not blind." The old statue's closed eyes reinforced this symbolism, but the new statue has open eyes, suggesting awareness and understanding. Instead of a sword representing authority, the new statue holds the Constitution, emphasizing justice based on constitutional values. The old statue wore a Western robe, whereas the new one is dressed in an Indian saree, reflecting cultural identity. The scales, symbolizing fairness, remain unchanged.

# How firms like Samsung view labour

The month-long strike at Samsung’s manufacturing facility in Sriperumbudur, Tamil Nadu, officially came to an end on October 15, 2023, following successful negotiations between the workers and the company’s management. This development, confirmed by the Tamil Nadu labour department, brings a temporary resolution to the labor unrest that had affected the factory’s operations. The strike, led by the Samsung India Workers’ Union (SIWU), saw workers demanding both economic improvements and the formal recognition of their union, though not all issues have been fully addressed.

### Background of the Strike

The workers at Samsung’s Sriperumbudur facility, located near Chennai, initiated the strike under the banner of the SIWU, which is affiliated with the Centre for Indian Trade Unions (CITU). The primary demand of the unionized workers was for better wages, including a structured and incremental salary increase over the next two years. Many of these workers are involved in assembling mobile phones, making the factory a key asset in Samsung’s global manufacturing network. 

Economic demands such as pay raises were crucial for the workers, many of whom cited stagnation in their wages despite increasing workloads. However, the central point of the protest was the demand for formal recognition of the Samsung India Workers’ Union by the company’s management. The union sought this recognition to negotiate more effectively on behalf of the workers and to represent them in matters concerning working conditions, pay, and other benefits.

### Outcome of Negotiations

Following extensive discussions facilitated by the Tamil Nadu labour department, an agreement was reached that led to the withdrawal of the strike. The workers, represented by SIWU, agreed to return to work starting from October 17, 2023. However, it was clear that not all demands were met. While some progress was made on salary increases and other economic issues, the management continued to resist the union’s demand for formal recognition.

The issue of union recognition remains unresolved, and it is a major point of contention between the workers and the management. Without formal recognition, the union is limited in its ability to negotiate on behalf of its members or participate fully in collective bargaining processes. To resolve this impasse, the workers have resorted to legal action, with the case now pending before the Madras High Court. The court's ruling on the matter will likely have significant implications for the future of labor relations at Samsung’s Sriperumbudur facility.

### Broader Context and Challenges

The strike highlights the ongoing struggles between labor unions and corporate management in India’s growing manufacturing sector. In many industries, particularly large multinational companies like Samsung, workers often find themselves facing resistance when seeking formal recognition for their unions. This reluctance from companies is often rooted in concerns about losing managerial control over labor decisions and fear of disruptions in production due to collective bargaining.

The Sriperumbudur strike also reflects broader issues within the Indian labor market, where workers in manufacturing and other sectors often face challenges related to wage stagnation, job security, and working conditions. Despite India’s growing importance as a global manufacturing hub, especially in electronics and mobile phone production, workers frequently struggle to secure improvements in their wages and benefits that match the sector’s rapid growth.

The involvement of the Centre for Indian Trade Unions (CITU), a national-level union affiliated with India’s communist movements, adds another layer to the situation. CITU has historically played a significant role in advocating for workers’ rights across various sectors, and its involvement in the Samsung strike demonstrates the continuing importance of traditional labor movements in modern industries.

### Future Implications

While the strike’s resolution has allowed production at Samsung’s Sriperumbudur facility to resume, the unresolved issue of union recognition means that labor tensions may persist. The Madras High Court's ruling will be critical in determining whether SIWU gains formal recognition and what that could mean for future negotiations between the workers and the management.

If the court rules in favor of the union, it could set a precedent for other manufacturing plants across India, where unions have struggled to gain formal recognition. It may also influence how multinational corporations in India approach labor relations, prompting more inclusive negotiations with workers and their representatives. On the other hand, if the court does not rule in favor of SIWU, it may weaken the union’s ability to advocate for workers’ rights and could discourage future unionization efforts in the region.

### Conclusion

The end of the month-long strike at Samsung’s Sriperumbudur facility marks a temporary victory for workers, who have secured some economic gains through negotiations. However, the central demand for union recognition remains unresolved, with the matter now in the hands of the judiciary. The outcome of the legal case will have broader implications for labor relations in India’s manufacturing sector, potentially shaping the future of union representation and collective bargaining in multinational companies operating in the country.

> The month-long strike at Samsung’s Sriperumbudur facility ended on October 15, 2023, after successful negotiations. Workers, led by the Samsung India Workers’ Union (SIWU), raised demands for salary increases and formal recognition of their union. While some economic demands were addressed, the management refused to recognize SIWU, leading the union to pursue legal action, with the case now pending in the Madras High Court. The resolution allows workers to return on October 17, but the issue of union recognition remains unresolved, potentially affecting future labor relations at the facility and across India’s manufacturing sector.

# Abject failure

The 2024 Global Hunger Index (GHI) has highlighted a disturbing reality for India, revealing that around 200 million people in the country are undernourished. This figure is equivalent to roughly 14% of India's total population, which, if considered as a standalone population, would rank as the seventh most populous country in the world, nearly matching Brazil’s population. The scale of undernourishment in India underscores the severity of the ongoing food security challenges in one of the world's fastest-growing economies.

### The Global Hunger Index (GHI)

The GHI, in its 19th edition this year, is an annual report that tracks hunger levels across the globe. The index is calculated using four key indicators: 
1. **Undernourishment** – the share of the population with insufficient caloric intake.
2. **Child Wasting** – the share of children under the age of five who have low weight for their height.
3. **Child Stunting** – the share of children under five who have low height for their age.
4. **Child Mortality** – the mortality rate of children under five.

By combining these indicators, the GHI provides a comprehensive picture of hunger and malnutrition levels. Countries are scored on a 100-point scale, with a higher score indicating more severe hunger. In recent years, India's score has consistently reflected a serious hunger problem, and the 2024 report is no different, placing India among the countries with high levels of undernourishment.

### Data Sources for India’s Hunger Metrics

The GHI’s analysis for India is based on a wide range of national data sources, including the **Sample Registration System (SRS)** statistical reports, which are published annually by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. These reports provide crucial information about births, deaths, infant mortality, and maternal mortality in India. Additionally, reports from the Ministry of Women and Child Development and NITI Aayog are also considered to understand the status of nutrition and child welfare programs in the country.

India’s high rate of undernourishment is driven by several factors. **Child stunting and wasting** continue to be significant challenges, as millions of children suffer from malnutrition, leading to physical and cognitive impairments. Additionally, the **undernourishment rate**, which measures the proportion of the population with inadequate caloric intake, remains alarmingly high. Despite economic growth, a large section of India’s population still lacks access to sufficient and nutritious food, primarily due to poverty, inequality, and ineffective food distribution systems.

### Government Programs and Challenges

India has introduced several programs aimed at addressing hunger and malnutrition, including the **National Food Security Act (NFSA)** and schemes like **Poshan Abhiyaan**, which focus on improving maternal and child nutrition. Despite these efforts, implementation gaps, inefficiencies in the public distribution system (PDS), and corruption continue to undermine progress. Moreover, issues like **food inflation**, **climate change**, and **agricultural distress** further exacerbate the hunger crisis, especially in rural and marginalized communities.

The pandemic has worsened the situation. The economic slowdown, job losses, and disruptions to the supply chain affected food security, pushing more people into poverty and hunger. Vulnerable groups such as migrant workers, women, and children have borne the brunt of these challenges, leading to a noticeable rise in undernourishment.

### Global Implications

India’s hunger crisis not only has domestic implications but also affects global efforts to combat hunger. As one of the most populous countries in the world, India's success or failure in addressing hunger will significantly impact global hunger reduction goals, particularly the United Nations’ **Sustainable Development Goal 2**, which aims to end hunger by 2030. 

### The Road Ahead

Addressing India’s hunger problem requires multi-faceted interventions. There is an urgent need to improve agricultural productivity, ensure food affordability, and enhance the efficiency of food distribution systems. Equally important is the need to invest in nutrition-sensitive programs, especially for women and children, who are disproportionately affected by malnutrition.

Furthermore, the government must work on better monitoring and targeting of welfare schemes to ensure that food and nutritional assistance reaches the most vulnerable. Strengthening the public health infrastructure is also critical to reducing child mortality and improving maternal health outcomes, both of which are closely linked to hunger and malnutrition.

### Conclusion

The 2024 Global Hunger Index paints a stark picture of hunger in India, with 200 million undernourished people representing a significant portion of the global population affected by food insecurity. Despite economic progress, hunger remains a persistent challenge for India, requiring urgent and sustained efforts from both the government and civil society to ensure that basic food and nutritional needs are met for all. Addressing this issue is not just about providing food but ensuring equitable access to nutrition and health, which is essential for long-term development and growth.

> The 2024 Global Hunger Index (GHI) reveals that 200 million people in India, or about 14% of the population, are undernourished—equivalent to the population of Brazil. This underscores India's significant hunger challenges, driven by issues like child stunting, child wasting, and widespread undernourishment. Despite government programs like the National Food Security Act and Poshan Abhiyaan, implementation gaps, poverty, and food inflation continue to hinder progress. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the crisis, affecting vulnerable groups. To address this, India needs to improve agricultural productivity, food distribution, and nutrition programs, particularly for children and marginalized communities.

# Canadian frostbite

The diplomatic rift between India and Canada has escalated into a serious confrontation, marking one of the most intense periods of tension in their bilateral relations. The situation stems from the June 2023 killing of Khalistani activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in British Columbia, which has now become a flashpoint in the deteriorating ties between the two nations. India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) recently revealed that the Canadian government is investigating the involvement of Indian diplomats in Nijjar’s death, and even sought to interrogate the Indian High Commissioner and five other diplomats, labeling them as "persons of interest."

Nijjar, a prominent figure within the Khalistani separatist movement that seeks the creation of a separate Sikh homeland, was wanted by Indian authorities for his alleged involvement in terrorist activities. His killing in Canada led to widespread condemnation and suspicion from pro-Khalistan groups, many of whom accused Indian agents of orchestrating the assassination. However, what has now turned the issue into a full-blown diplomatic crisis is Canada’s police force, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), stating its belief that Indian diplomats might be linked to Nijjar’s murder.

In a press conference, the RCMP explained that they suspect an Indian criminal network could be behind the killing, and alleged that some Indian diplomats may have been involved. The police also noted that their investigation extends beyond Nijjar’s death, with concerns about a broader network possibly targeting members of the Indian diaspora in Canada. This revelation has caused an uproar, particularly in light of Canada’s growing concerns over the safety of its large Sikh community, some of whom have expressed support for the Khalistani cause.

India has reacted strongly to the allegations. The MEA firmly denied any involvement of its diplomats in the incident, describing the accusations as "baseless" and accusing the Canadian government of not providing credible evidence to back its claims. India’s government views the ongoing investigation as part of a broader Canadian effort to placate the country's significant Sikh population, which plays a notable role in Canadian domestic politics. India has long expressed its displeasure with what it perceives as Canada's leniency towards pro-Khalistan activists, many of whom continue to live and operate freely in Canada.

This latest development has plunged India-Canada relations into unprecedented strain. Diplomatic ties, which had already been faltering over disagreements regarding the treatment of the Indian diaspora and Canada’s perceived tolerance of separatist elements, have now reached a critical juncture. Both countries have expelled diplomats in recent weeks, and trade talks that were progressing earlier this year have come to a complete halt.

For Canada, the allegations raise significant concerns about the sanctity of its sovereignty and the safety of its citizens. The Canadian government’s decision to make these suspicions public reflects the seriousness with which it views this potential breach of its national security. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has emphasized the need for a thorough investigation and has called for full cooperation from the Indian government.

From India’s perspective, the accusations are seen as an affront to its sovereignty and an attack on its diplomatic mission. India has warned Canada against "politicizing" the issue and has reiterated its stance that Khalistani terrorism remains a serious national security threat. India views the accusations as an extension of the longstanding tensions over how Canada manages the activities of pro-Khalistan elements within its borders.

The situation represents a significant diplomatic challenge for both countries, as the fallout from these allegations could further erode trust and cooperation in areas like trade, education, and geopolitical collaboration. The long-standing cultural and economic ties between India and Canada are now at risk as the two nations navigate this complex and highly charged issue. In the short term, both sides are likely to maintain a hardened stance, but diplomatic channels remain open, with hopes that dialogue can eventually de-escalate the conflict.

> India and Canada’s diplomatic relations have sharply deteriorated following allegations from Canada that Indian diplomats were involved in the June 2023 killing of Khalistani activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in British Columbia. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) suspects the involvement of Indian criminal networks and diplomats in Nijjar's death and potential targeting of Indian diaspora members. India has denied the accusations, calling them baseless, while Canada has emphasized the need for a thorough investigation. The dispute has led to expulsions of diplomats and stalled trade talks, further straining the already tense relations between the two nations.
