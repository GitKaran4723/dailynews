# A perilous highway to salvation in the Himalayas

The 900-kilometre Char Dham Highway Project, aimed at boosting religious tourism to four major shrines in Uttarakhand, has become a subject of major environmental concern. Spearheaded as an all-weather road project with a budget of ₹12,000 crore, it has faced strong opposition from environmental groups since its inception due to its potentially harmful impact on the fragile mountain ecology. These fears were confirmed by a recent scientific paper authored by Jürgen Mey and his team at the Institute of Environmental Science and Geography, University of Potsdam, Germany, which detailed the project’s devastating effects on the region’s environment.

The paper focuses on a specific 250-kilometre stretch between Rishikesh and Joshimath, part of National Highway 7 (NH-7). The study recorded more than 300 landslides along this route following exceptionally heavy rainfall between September and October 2022. The researchers identified 309 fully or partially road-blocking landslides along this corridor, averaging about 1.25 landslides per kilometre. This alarming statistic highlights the rapid environmental degradation caused by road widening and poor construction practices, which experts had previously warned about.

The study pointed to several factors that contribute to these landslides, including the slope angle, rainfall intensity, and the geology of the region. However, it emphasized that the ongoing road-widening efforts had a "doubling impact" on the frequency of road-blocking landslides. This finding confirms earlier warnings from expert committees, which had been overruled by authorities pushing ahead with the project. The construction work, which involves extensive excavation and cutting into mountain slopes, is now understood to be the primary trigger for the landslides, exacerbating natural vulnerabilities in the Himalayan terrain.

The increased frequency of landslides has also led to a rise in accidents and fatalities, especially during the Char Dham pilgrimage season, when thousands of devotees travel to the region. This has sparked renewed criticism of the project, with environmentalists pointing out that the government ignored scientific evidence and expert recommendations, prioritizing tourism over sustainability. Improper construction practices, such as inadequate slope stabilization and careless debris disposal, have only worsened the situation.

The findings of the Potsdam study further amplify concerns about the long-term impact of large-scale infrastructure projects in the ecologically sensitive Himalayas. The Char Dham Highway Project, despite its potential benefits for tourism and regional development, poses serious risks to human life, natural ecosystems, and the overall stability of the region. This issue underscores the need for better planning, stricter environmental safeguards, and greater adherence to scientific advice when developing such projects in fragile environments like the Himalayas.

The project, which was initiated under the ‘Char Dham Pariyojana’, is in fundamental violation of all environmental norms and conservation strategies that need to be followed in the Himalayas.

The government used a technical loophole and divided the project into 50-plus smaller projects to bypass environmental clearance and impact assessment reports. Calling the project a ‘geological and ecological fraud, the petitioners have argued that the roads were longer than 100 km in some stretches and would have a cumulative impact on the whole region. Land encroachment combined with the blasting and the cutting of slopes for developmental projects causes additional stress on a fragile ecosystem. One accepts that roads are the lifeline of remote mountainous regions, but such megaprojects must fully consider the region’s environmental fragility.

Though the project began as a tourism project, it was finally defended in the Supreme Court of India as a defence-related requirement for moving troops and armaments, ignoring the point that the defence forces can airlift troops and heavy artillery during emergencies. The Court initially favouring a narrower intermediate road width for the highways (5.5 m), based on the recommendation of an expert committee appointed in 2019 and a Ministry of Road Transport and Highways’ circular of 2018. But the Court finally permitted the Union Government to go ahead with the project on widening the hill roads from a national security angle.

### No scientific assessment

It is a matter of concern that such massive projects are getting the go-ahead without any scientific assessment especially in an unstable and fragile region such as the Indian Himalayas. A key question is this: is mountain morphology, with steep slopes and sharp gradients, easily amenable to human engineering? Unlike the hinterland in the mountains, the steep gradients of the Uttarakhand Himalaya or the Himachal Himalaya make them dynamically heterogeneous in terms of climatic variables and hydrological and tectonic processes at every turn of the mountain path.

A widened road faces problems now as it is constantly blocked by recurrent landslides. It is most likely that this project will end up not being what it was envisioned to be. Not only would the movement of troops or armaments be delayed in critical moments but also much time and resources would have to be used to clear or reconstruct damaged road stretches. Year-wise statistics show a rise in the loss of human lives. In the last four years, 160 people have lost their life in landslide incidents in Uttarakhand, according to the National Crime Records Bureau.

The entire region has been destabilised due to massive construction activities. Ground subsidence is now recognised as a “silent disaster” in many parts of the Himalayas. In a study published in Scientific Reports this year, widely reported land deformation in Joshimath town is being attributed to uncontrolled anthropogenic activities, infrastructural development and inadequate drainage systems. Recently, it has been reported that the Tungnath temple in the Rudraprayag district is facing serious issues such as subsidence, weakening foundation and shifting wall slates, which have caused water leakage especially during the rainy season.

Such incidents have not impacted the government’s thinking on its developmental models for such fragile areas. Unsurprisingly, the Border Roads Organisation is now seeking clearance to widen the Gangotri-Dharasu stretch in the fragile Bhagirathi Eco-Sensitive Zone, whose integrity is important for the ecology of the Ganga river near its origin.

### The issue of local distress

According to Census 2011, of Uttarakhand’s 16,793 villages, 1,053 have no inhabitants, while another 405 have a population of less than 10 people. This situation must have been aggravated recently since large-scale infrastructural projects were brought into the hill State. Internal and external migration have led to depopulation and land abandonment in rural areas despite the State government’s initiatives in incentivising agriculture. Road widening, that promotes increased motorised tourism, will encourage entrepreneurs from the plains to set up hotels and business centres, often forcing the local people to opt for employment in the tourism industry rather than sticking to farming.

Environmental factors such as the depletion of water resources and other emerging hazards may have resulted in people leaving the agriculture sectors. With low returns from the land, farmers sell their lands to private entrepreneurs from the plains.

The State government is countering this trend by framing laws against selling land to outsiders, but this is a step that will not mitigate the local distress caused by human-induced environmental degradation. The State government claims that Uttarakhand’s GSDP has increased 1.3 times in 20 months and that the unemployment rate has decreased by 4.4% in one year. By its admission, people in the State have obtained more employment in tourism.

Making feel-good speeches on climate-change resilience in COP meetings while implementing disaster-prone infrastructure in the country’s most fragile area proves a double standard. The Himalayas face multifaceted environmental challenges that require well-thought-out sustainable pathways. The Union and State governments must scale down these ongoing massive construction programmes, which include dams, and formulate sound ecological solutions for the mess they have already created.

In conclusion, the Char Dham Highway Project exemplifies the conflict between development and environmental sustainability. While the project aims to enhance religious tourism and provide better road connectivity, its consequences for the mountain ecology could be catastrophic. The study's findings highlight the urgent need for authorities to reconsider their approach and prioritize sustainable construction practices, ensuring that development does not come at the cost of the region’s ecological health and the safety of its residents.

> The Char Dham Highway Project in Uttarakhand, aimed at boosting religious tourism, has raised serious environmental concerns. A scientific study led by Jürgen Mey from the University of Potsdam confirmed that road-widening efforts are significantly increasing landslides, particularly along the 250-km Rishikesh-Joshimath corridor. The study recorded 309 road-blocking landslides, attributing their rise primarily to the ongoing construction. Despite warnings from environmental experts, the project has continued, leading to fatalities and accidents, particularly during pilgrimage seasons. The findings highlight the urgent need for sustainable practices to prevent catastrophic damage to the fragile Himalayan ecology and ensure public safety.

# Forecasting better in India, come rain or shine

This year’s monsoon season in India has been marked by severe flooding across most States, making it one of the worst in recent memory. The recurrent nature of these floods reflects the increasing unpredictability of the monsoon, a trend linked to climate change. A 2021 study by the **Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW)** highlighted the growing challenges of alternating climatic hazards, with nearly 40% of India’s districts experiencing both floods and droughts during different seasons. The alternating pattern of extreme weather is a significant concern, as regions that flood during the monsoon may face drought during the dry season, creating a complex and challenging situation for agriculture, infrastructure, and livelihoods.

Furthermore, an analysis by the same organization of 40 years of rainfall data reveals a worrying trend. The study found that over the last decade, there has been an increase of up to 64% in heavy rainfall days during the monsoons. This escalation in intense rainfall events has exacerbated the frequency and severity of flooding, particularly in urban areas where drainage systems are ill-equipped to handle sudden, massive downpours. The rise in extreme weather events can be linked to climate change, which is making the Indian monsoon less predictable and more intense.

### The Need for Better Forecasting Systems

In this increasingly volatile climatic scenario, India faces a critical gap in early warning systems for floods. While two-thirds of the country’s population is exposed to flood risks, only one-third of this population benefits from early warning systems. This stark contrast is evident when compared to cyclone-prone areas in India, where early warning systems have achieved full coverage and have significantly reduced the loss of life and property during cyclones.

Cyclone early warning systems in India have seen significant advancements in recent years, largely due to investments in technological innovation and forecasting infrastructure. However, the same focus has not been applied to flood risk management, which remains a key vulnerability. With floods posing a growing threat to both urban and rural areas, there is an urgent need for India to invest in enhancing its flood forecasting systems and disaster preparedness mechanisms.

### Technological Innovation as a Safety Net

Given the growing threat of extreme weather, it is clear that India must bring technological innovation to the forefront of disaster risk management. The government must prioritize investment in state-of-the-art weather forecasting technologies, real-time data analysis, and satellite-based monitoring systems to predict flood events more accurately. This could involve expanding the reach of **Doppler weather radar systems**, which can track rainfall intensity and provide crucial data for early warnings.

Additionally, the deployment of **GIS-based flood modeling** and **machine learning algorithms** can help predict flood-prone areas with greater accuracy. Such systems could enable authorities to issue timely and location-specific warnings, allowing people to evacuate or prepare in advance, minimizing the loss of life and damage to infrastructure.

Public awareness campaigns and education are also essential to ensuring that early warning systems are effective. Communities, particularly in vulnerable areas, need to be trained in flood preparedness and response to ensure that they act quickly when warnings are issued.

### Conclusion

The increasing unpredictability of the Indian monsoon, driven by climate change, poses a significant threat to the country’s population, infrastructure, and economy. The gap in flood early warning systems, especially when compared to the coverage for cyclone-prone areas, highlights the need for urgent attention to this issue. By investing in advanced weather forecasting technologies and expanding early warning systems, India can better safeguard its population from the growing risks of extreme weather events. As these climate challenges intensify, enhanced forecasting and disaster preparedness will be crucial to building resilience and minimizing the impacts of future monsoons.
