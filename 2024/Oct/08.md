# 2024 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine

The **2024 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine** was awarded to **Victor Ambros** and **Gary Ruvkun**, two American scientists, for their groundbreaking discovery of **microRNA** and its crucial role in regulating gene activity. MicroRNAs are small molecules that help control which genes are expressed in different types of cells at specific times. Their discovery has significantly advanced the understanding of gene regulation, which is essential for the development and function of complex organisms, including humans.

Although applications of microRNA research in medicine are still in development, this discovery has vast potential for future treatments of diseases like cancer and cardiovascular conditions.

**MicroRNAs (miRNAs)** are small, non-coding RNA molecules, typically about 20-25 nucleotides in length, that play a critical role in the regulation of gene expression. They were first discovered in the early 1990s in the model organism **Caenorhabditis elegans** by Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun, who were awarded the 2024 Nobel Prize in Medicine for their work. 

### **Key Functions of MicroRNAs:**
1. **Gene Regulation**: miRNAs bind to complementary sequences on **messenger RNA (mRNA)** molecules, primarily at the 3' untranslated region (UTR), resulting in the degradation of mRNA or inhibition of translation. This ultimately prevents the production of certain proteins.
   
2. **Developmental Processes**: They are involved in key **developmental processes**, including cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. miRNAs help ensure that specific genes are expressed at the right time and in the right cells during development.

3. **Disease and Therapeutic Potential**: Abnormalities in miRNA expression are associated with various diseases, including **cancer**, **cardiovascular diseases**, and **neurodegenerative disorders**. Research is ongoing into developing miRNA-based therapies for treating these conditions, though challenges remain in precisely targeting specific miRNAs without affecting others.

4. **Highly Conserved Across Species**: miRNAs are evolutionarily conserved across a wide range of species, from plants to animals, indicating their fundamental role in gene regulation. For example, the "let-7" miRNA, first identified in C. elegans, is also found in humans and is crucial in controlling cell growth.

### **Discovery and Impact**
The discovery of miRNAs revolutionized the understanding of **post-transcriptional regulation**. Previously, gene regulation was thought to occur primarily through transcription factors that control mRNA synthesis. The identification of miRNAs added a new layer of complexity to gene regulation, showing that small RNA molecules could fine-tune gene expression after transcription, thus impacting a wide array of biological functions.

### **MicroRNA and Disease**
1. **Cancer**: Certain miRNAs act as **oncogenes** (promoting cancer) or **tumor suppressors**. For instance, the overexpression of **miR-21** is found in several types of cancer, contributing to uncontrolled cell proliferation.
   
2. **Cardiovascular Diseases**: miRNAs play roles in heart development and function. Dysregulated miRNAs are implicated in heart failure, arrhythmias, and other cardiovascular diseases.

3. **Neurodegenerative Disorders**: miRNAs are involved in brain function and development. Abnormal miRNA expression has been linked to diseases like **Alzheimer's**, **Parkinson's**, and **Huntington's disease**.

### **Challenges and Therapeutic Potential**
Developing miRNA-based therapies holds great promise but also poses significant challenges. Since miRNAs can regulate multiple genes, ensuring **specificity** without off-target effects is difficult. However, promising research is ongoing, especially in the fields of cancer therapy and cardiovascular disease treatment.

### **Conclusion**
miRNAs are essential regulators of gene expression and hold vast potential for understanding and treating human diseases. Their discovery has provided a new dimension to genetic research, offering insights into the complexity of biological processes and the potential for novel therapeutic approaches.

# Unpacking the Centre’s affidavit on marital rape

The **Marital Rape Exception (MRE)**, as outlined in Section 63, Exception 2 of the **Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023** (formerly Section 375, Exception 2 of the **Indian Penal Code, 1860**), is a legal provision that exempts sexual intercourse by a husband with his wife from being categorized as rape, as long as the wife is not under the age of 18. Specifically, it states, *“Sexual intercourse or sexual acts by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under eighteen years of age, is not rape.”*

This provision has been a subject of significant debate and controversy. It is currently under challenge before the **Supreme Court of India**, with petitions seeking to strike it down as unconstitutional. The provision has been criticized for its potential violation of women's rights to equality, bodily autonomy, and personal dignity. At the same time, the **Central Government** has filed an affidavit in support of retaining the Marital Rape Exception, which necessitates a deeper exploration of the arguments on both sides.

### **Legal and Constitutional Background**

The Marital Rape Exception originates from the 19th-century **Indian Penal Code (IPC)**, which was enacted by the British colonial government. At the time, marriage was viewed through the lens of traditional patriarchy, where a wife was considered to have given implied and permanent consent to sexual relations by virtue of the marital contract. This legal exception effectively gives a husband immunity from being charged with rape for non-consensual sex with his wife, as long as she is not under the age of 18.

The **Constitution of India**, however, guarantees the **right to equality** (Article 14), the **right to life and personal liberty** (Article 21), and the prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of gender (Article 15). Opponents of the MRE argue that it directly violates these constitutional rights, as it allows for non-consensual sex within marriage, which would otherwise be considered a crime outside of marriage. They also point out that the exception reinforces outdated and regressive gender norms, reducing women’s bodily autonomy and denying them protection from sexual violence within the marital relationship.

### **Arguments in Favor of MRE**

The **Central Government**, in its affidavit supporting the Marital Rape Exception, has put forward several arguments in favor of retaining the provision. These include:

1. **Preservation of the Institution of Marriage**: The government argues that criminalizing marital rape could destabilize the institution of marriage, which is considered a cornerstone of Indian society. It asserts that introducing rape charges within marriage could lead to an increase in false allegations and misuse of the law, disrupting family harmony.
   
2. **Existing Legal Protections for Women**: The affidavit points out that there are already legal protections for women who face sexual violence within marriage, such as under **Section 498A of the IPC**, which deals with cruelty to wives, and provisions under the **Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005**. The government suggests that these laws are sufficient to address cases of abuse without criminalizing marital rape.

3. **Cultural and Social Context**: The government’s stance reflects concerns about the societal and cultural context in India, where traditional views on marriage prevail. It argues that changes to the law need to be sensitive to these cultural realities and that a sudden imposition of Western legal frameworks may not align with Indian societal norms.

### **Arguments Against MRE**

Opponents of the MRE argue that it is an outdated legal provision that infringes on women’s fundamental rights. Key arguments include:

1. **Violation of Constitutional Rights**: The MRE violates the right to equality and the right to personal dignity by giving legal sanction to non-consensual sex within marriage. Women’s consent is just as essential within a marriage as it is outside of it, and the exception denies married women the same protection against sexual violence that is afforded to others.

2. **Bodily Autonomy**: Women have the right to control their own bodies, and the MRE undermines this autonomy by implying that marriage nullifies the need for consent. In essence, it reduces a woman’s agency over her own body, perpetuating the notion that a husband has a right to sexual access to his wife irrespective of her consent.

3. **Global Standards and Human Rights**: Many countries have already criminalized marital rape, recognizing it as a violation of women’s human rights. India’s retention of the MRE places it out of step with international norms and human rights standards.

4. **Psychological and Social Harm**: Allowing marital rape to remain legal fosters a culture of impunity around sexual violence within marriages. Victims are less likely to come forward or seek help, as their experience is not recognized as a crime, leading to long-term psychological harm and perpetuating cycles of abuse.

### **Conclusion**

The Marital Rape Exception in Indian law is at the center of an important legal and social debate. While the government argues that its removal could destabilize marriage and lead to misuse of the law, critics argue that it violates women’s fundamental rights and perpetuates gender inequality. The Supreme Court's eventual decision on this issue will have profound implications for women's rights in India, particularly regarding consent, bodily autonomy, and the protection against sexual violence within marriage.

> The **Marital Rape Exception (MRE)**, under Section 63, Exception 2 of the **Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023**, exempts non-consensual sex within marriage from being classified as rape, provided the wife is over 18. Currently under challenge in the **Supreme Court**, the Central Government supports the MRE, arguing it protects the institution of marriage and that existing laws address abuse. Critics, however, argue the MRE violates constitutional rights to equality and bodily autonomy, perpetuating outdated gender norms. They call for its removal to align India with global human rights standards and ensure women’s protection against sexual violence, even within marriage.

# On ‘casteist’ provisions in prison manuals

The Supreme Court on October 3 declared that caste-based division of labour in prisons is “unconstitutional”. A three-judge Bench headed by Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud struck down several provisions in State prison manuals, that reinforced caste differences, for being violative of the fundamental rights of prisoners.

What was the case?

The court was hearing a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) petition filed by journalist Sukanya Shantha highlighting provisions in prison manuals in States such as Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Odisha, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala that legitimised caste inequalities. For instance, it was pointed out that the separation of Thevars, Nadars, and Pallars in different sections of the Palayamkottai Central Jail in Tamil Nadu constituted a “glaring instance of caste-based segregation of barracks”. Similarly, the Rajasthan Prison Rules, 1951, allocated latrine duties to the “Mehtar” caste — a Scheduled Caste community — while Brahmins or “sufficiently high caste Hindu prisoners” were assigned to the kitchens, thereby perpetuating caste-based labour divisions.

How do prison manuals reinforce colonial stereotypes?

The now-repealed Criminal Tribes Act, 1871, permitted the British colonial regime to designate certain marginalised communities as “criminal tribes” based on the stereotypical notion that they were “born criminals.” Following the revocation of the Act, these groups were reclassified as “denotified tribes” yet prison manuals continued to label them as “habitual offenders” sans any conviction. The court noted that such classification perpetuates colonial-era caste-based discrimination, exacerbating the social and economic marginalisation of these communities.

Citing examples from various prison manuals, the court highlighted that Rule 404 of the West Bengal Jail Code stipulates that a convict overseer may be appointed as a night guard only if “he does not belong to any class that may have a strong natural tendency to escape, such as men of wandering tribes.” Similarly, prison manuals in Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala define “habitual criminals” as individuals who, by “habit,” are “robbers, housebreakers, dacoits, thieves, or receivers of stolen property” or who “habitually commit extortion, cheating, counterfeiting coins, currency notes, stamps, or forgery,” even in the absence of any prior convictions. Further, the rules in Andhra Pradesh equate “a member of a wandering or criminal tribe” with “a bad or dangerous character, or one who has ever escaped or attempted to escape from lawful custody,” prohibiting their employment in any labour outside the prison walls.

How are fundamental rights of prisoners violated?

Underscoring that caste may be employed as a criterion for classification only when it seeks to benefit victims of caste discrimination, the top court ruled that the prison manuals failed to achieve this objective and instead contravened Article 14 of the Constitution. “Segregating prisoners on the basis of caste would reinforce caste differences or animosity that ought to be prevented in the first place”, it reasoned. The judges further opined that differentiating between inmates based on “habit,” “custom,” “superior mode of living,” and “natural tendency to escape” offends principles of substantive equality.

“By assigning cleaning and sweeping work to the marginalised castes, while allowing the high castes to do cooking, the Manuals directly discriminate. This is an instance of direct discrimination under Article 15(1)”, the Bench asserted. Furthermore, assigning specific tasks to these communities based on their purported “customary” roles, rather than offering “more skilled, dignified, or intellectual work,” was deemed to result in indirect discrimination.

Referring to prison rules that require food to be cooked by members of a “suitable caste” or “menial duties” to be exclusively performed by communities “accustomed” to such work, the court noted that these practices constituted untouchability, prohibited under Article 17. “When Prison Manuals restrict the reformation of prisoners from marginalised communities, they violate their right to life. At the same time, such provisions deprive prisoners from marginalised groups of a sense of dignity and the expectation that they should be treated equally”, the CJI underscored.

What were the directions issued?

All States and Union Territories were directed to amend their prison manuals and rules within three months to abolish such discriminatory practices.

Several lacunas were also flagged in the Union government’s Model Prison Manual, 2016, and the Model Prisons and Correctional Services Act, 2023. The 2016 manual, in particular, faced criticism for offering a vague definition of “habitual offender”, allowing States to define the term based on stereotypical assumptions against denotified tribes. Consequently, the court ordered that necessary reforms be implemented in both the 2016 manual and the 2023 Act within three months. To ensure compliance with these directives, district legal services authorities and boards of visitors were tasked with conducting regular inspections.

> On October 3, 2024, the **Supreme Court of India** declared the caste-based division of labour in prisons unconstitutional. A three-judge Bench, led by **Chief Justice D.Y. Chandrachud**, ruled that assigning work to prisoners based on caste violates their fundamental rights to equality, dignity, and non-discrimination under the Constitution. The Court struck down provisions in state prison manuals that institutionalized caste-based tasks, emphasizing that prisoners retain their rights even while incarcerated. The ruling mandates prison authorities to assign work based on merit and aptitude, marking a significant step towards ending caste discrimination and improving conditions within India’s prison system.
