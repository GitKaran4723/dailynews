# 5.3 magnitude earthquake jolts Telangana’s Mulugu

### **Earthquakes: Causes, Problems, Mitigation Strategies, and High-Risk Zones in India**

#### **How Do Earthquakes Happen?**
Earthquakes are natural phenomena caused by the sudden release of energy in the Earth's crust, creating seismic waves. They primarily occur due to:

1. **Tectonic Plate Movements**:
   - The Earth's crust is divided into large plates that float on the molten mantle. When these plates collide, separate, or slide past each other, stress builds up along faults or plate boundaries.
   - The release of this stress causes earthquakes.

2. **Volcanic Activity**:
   - Movement of magma beneath the Earth's surface can trigger earthquakes, particularly in volcanic regions.

3. **Human Activities**:
   - Activities like mining, dam construction, and drilling can induce minor earthquakes by altering the natural stress balance.

4. **Other Causes**:
   - Landslides or explosions can also generate localized seismic activity.

---

#### **Problems Caused by Earthquakes**

1. **Loss of Life and Property**:
   - Collapsed buildings and infrastructure lead to significant fatalities and injuries.
   - High-magnitude earthquakes can result in widespread devastation.

2. **Displacement**:
   - Communities near the epicenter may face large-scale displacement due to uninhabitable conditions.

3. **Economic Losses**:
   - Destruction of buildings, roads, and utilities impacts local and national economies.
   - Recovery and reconstruction require substantial financial resources.

4. **Secondary Effects**:
   - **Tsunamis**: Undersea earthquakes can trigger massive ocean waves.
   - **Landslides**: Earthquakes in hilly or mountainous regions can cause landslides, blocking roads and rivers.
   - **Fires**: Broken gas lines and electrical faults can ignite fires.

5. **Environmental Damage**:
   - Destruction of natural habitats, contamination of water sources, and changes in landforms.

# A cut in time

### The Global Plastics Treaty: Ambitions and Impediments

The Global Plastics Treaty, piloted by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), was initiated with the goal of ending plastic pollution, including in marine environments. The process began with a resolution passed in 2022, hailed as historic for fostering global consensus on the need for coordinated action against plastic pollution. Over two years, countries convened five times, with the latest meeting in Busan aiming to finalize a broad framework. Despite the initial enthusiasm, the treaty’s progress has been stalled due to disagreements over the best approach to address plastic pollution.

#### **The Challenge of Plastic Pollution**

Plastic, though integral to modern consumption, has become a severe environmental hazard. Its durability, once a strength, now contributes to its widespread accumulation in land and marine ecosystems. Plastic has infiltrated the bodies of animals and humans, posing long-term ecological and health threats. Inefficient recycling systems and the sheer volume of plastic waste exacerbate the issue, making it more than just an aesthetic problem.

#### **The Divide in Perspectives**

The 170 countries present at the Busan meeting were sharply divided:

1. **Proponents of Production Cuts**:
   - Led by the European Union and supported by Pacific island nations, this group advocates for a reduction in the production of virgin polymer, the raw material for plastics.
   - They argue that better recycling and reuse are insufficient to address the crisis and that only reducing plastic production can effectively tackle the problem.

2. **Opponents of Production Cuts**:
   - Large developing countries and those with economies reliant on oil and petrochemical refining oppose this approach.
   - They view such measures as trade barriers disguised as environmentalism and argue that the treaty’s focus should remain on managing waste rather than regulating production.

India aligns with the second group, emphasizing the economic indispensability of plastic. However, this stance must be reconciled with the fact that India recycles only a third of its annual plastic production, leaving a significant volume to accumulate in the environment.

#### **The Impasse and Its Implications**

The impasse reflects a deeper conflict between environmental priorities and economic dependencies. While developed nations push for transformative changes, many developing countries fear the economic consequences of reduced plastic production. This discord threatens to derail the treaty’s progress and undermines the global resolve to combat plastic pollution.

#### **The Way Forward**

Despite the deadlock, there is hope that countries will reconvene with fresh perspectives to overcome the impasse. For India, the challenge lies in balancing economic interests with environmental responsibilities. Immediate steps include:

1. **Improving Recycling Capacity**:
   - Expanding and modernizing recycling infrastructure to manage plastic waste more effectively.

2. **Evaluating Health Impacts**:
   - Conducting research on the health effects of plastic pollution on humans and ecosystems.

3. **Planning a Gradual Transition**:
   - Strategically reducing reliance on virgin polymer through innovations in biodegradable alternatives and promoting a circular economy.

4. **International Cooperation**:
   - Actively participating in negotiations to develop equitable solutions that address the concerns of both developed and developing nations.

#### **Conclusion**

Plastic pollution is a global crisis that demands collective action. While the Global Plastics Treaty faces challenges, countries must strive to find common ground. For India, delaying action on plastic pollution risks severe environmental and health consequences. A planned and gradual shift from plastic dependency is crucial, ensuring the country contributes meaningfully to global efforts while safeguarding its own future.

> The Global Plastics Treaty, initiated by the UNEP to combat plastic pollution, faces delays due to disagreements among nations. Developed countries, led by the EU, advocate cutting virgin polymer production, seeing recycling as insufficient to address pollution. Developing nations, including India, oppose these measures, viewing them as trade barriers and focusing on waste management instead. Plastic's indispensability to modern economies clashes with its severe environmental and health impacts. India must reconcile its stance by improving recycling, researching health effects, and planning a gradual transition to sustainable alternatives. Collaborative global efforts remain crucial to addressing this pressing environmental crisis effectively.

# India’s strategic focus on West Africa

Last month, on his way to Brazil to participate in the G-20 Summit, Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a strategic halt in Nigeria. During his first two terms, Mr. Modi travelled to 10 African countries, including Uganda, where he delivered a historic speech outlining India’s vision of Africa. However, his visit to Nigeria is significant as it marks the first African visit of the Prime Minister in his third term. This visit is also the first by an Indian Prime Minister to Nigeria in 17 years.

The importance accorded to India by Nigeria was evident from the very moment Nigerian President Bola Ahmed Tinubu welcomed Mr. Modi at Abuja airport. Later, the Indian Prime Minister was conferred Nigeria’s second-highest national award, the Grand Commander of the Order of the Niger. He became the only second foreign dignitary to receive the distinction since 1969, after Queen Elizabeth II, underlining India’s rising global stature and the trust and recognition Mr. Modi has gained for his commitment to the Global South.

### India-Nigeria ties

Nigeria is both the largest economy and the largest democracy in Africa. Nigeria is also a regional hegemon in West Africa and plays an important role at the African Union level. It is regarded as a democratic role model and has, in the past, used its clout to mediate disputes on the African continent. Strengthening India’s ties with Nigeria would undoubtedly have effects far beyond the nation’s borders.

In his conversation with President Tinubu, Mr. Modi reiterated the high priority India accords to its strategic partnership with Nigeria and expressed interest in boosting ties in areas such as defence, energy, technology, trade, health, and education. With terrorism, separatism, piracy, and drug trafficking as major challenges for Nigeria, Mr. Modi underscored the continuing salience of strong cooperation on security issues. This encompasses the purchase of Indian weapons and cooperation in the counterterrorism operations against the Islamist groups, particularly Boko Haram.

Mr. Modi’s trip is also a follow-up to an Indian defence industry delegation’s visit to Lagos earlier this year. Mr. Tinubu had expressed interest in buying arms from India during that visit. India is emerging as a key defence supplier to Africa, with sales to Egypt, Algeria, Morocco, Tanzania, and Mozambique.

In over six decades of close partnership between India and Nigeria, India has also emerged as a development partner of Nigeria on two fronts — offering developmental assistance through concessional loans ($100 million) and capacity-building training programmes — shaping this partnership in a distinctive ‘India Way’.

### Nigeria’s China connection

Nigeria currently has over 200 Chinese companies. It is China’s largest export market and its second-largest trading partner in Africa. On the other hand, China is Nigeria’s third-largest export market. China has funded over $47 billion for 22 large-size infrastructural projects across the country. As of March 31, 2020, Chinese loans to Nigeria totalled $3.121 billion, or 11.28% of Nigeria’s $27.67 billion in external debt. Earlier, Nigeria had undertaken several significant infrastructure projects using Chinese money, such as the National Public Security Communications System project and the Abuja Light Rail project, and planned terminal expansions at four major airports.

In 2023, China funded the Lekki Deep Sea Port. The port, one of the largest in West Africa, will relieve cargo congestion, which costs billions of dollars in annual revenue and is expected to generate over 170,000 new jobs. It is anticipated that the port will boost Nigeria’s struggling economy.

The Chinese technology giant Huawei has a significant presence in Nigeria. Since 2019, Huawei has trained 2,000 Nigerian youths and 1,000 federal civil servants across Ministries, departments, and agencies, and it plans to continue training government employees in cybersecurity strategy. Huawei has deployed over 27,500 mobile phone towers and up to 10,000 kilometres of fibre optic cable in Nigeria. It has also signed a contract with the Federal government to install an electronic surveillance system at the country’s land borders.

China is also active in Nigeria’s mining sector. Last February, Kaduna selected China’s Ming Xin Mineral Separation Nig Ltd. to build the nation’s first lithium-processing plant. It aims to produce batteries for electric vehicles. Yet, five months ago, the Nigerian government rejected Tesla’s proposal to buy raw lithium from the country. Meanwhile, China Sinoma International Engineering and Nigeria’s Dangote Industries Limited also signed a contract to construct a cement plant with six million tonnes per year in Itori, Ogun state.

Despite growing Chinese interest in financing and building infrastructure, India remains one of Nigeria’s key partners. Trade between India and Nigeria has declined from $14.95 billion in 2021-22 to $7.89 billion in 2023-24, primarily due to India’s increasing oil imports from Russia. India and Nigeria, however, continue cooperating on multiple issues. As leaders of the Global South, an enhanced bilateral relationship between India and Nigeria should also auger well for the larger Global South.

Mr. Modi’s visit to Nigeria has brought the country into the spotlight, but much more sustained effort will be required to convert the goodwill into concrete deliverable outcomes.

> India's strategic focus on West Africa is driven by the region's growing economic potential, energy resources, and India's commitment to South-South cooperation. Key areas of engagement include trade, investment, energy partnerships, and capacity building through development projects under the **India-Africa Forum Summit** framework. India is expanding diplomatic ties, fostering people-to-people connections, and strengthening security cooperation to counter terrorism and piracy in the region. The emphasis on renewable energy, healthcare, and skill development aligns with India's broader goals of sustainable development and mutual prosperity. West Africa plays a vital role in India's Africa strategy, contributing to geopolitical and economic interests.
