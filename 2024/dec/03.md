# Logjam ends; Parliament to debate Constitution

### **Parliamentary Debate in India: Overview and Analysis**

The Parliament of India, as the supreme legislative body, is the cornerstone of democratic governance. Its primary functions include legislation, discussion, and accountability. However, the effectiveness of debates in Parliament has often been questioned. Here, we analyze the tools of parliamentary debate, current challenges, and suggestions for improvement.

---

### **Tools for Parliamentary Debate**

1. **Question Hour:**
   - Held at the beginning of each parliamentary sitting.
   - Members of Parliament (MPs) ask questions to ministers about their ministries' functioning.
   - Encourages accountability and transparency in governance.
   - Often becomes an important platform for opposition MPs to scrutinize government policies.

2. **Zero Hour:**
   - Starts immediately after Question Hour.
   - MPs can raise urgent matters without prior notice.
   - Provides flexibility to address issues of immediate public concern.
   - Criticized for lack of structure and being prone to disruptions.

3. **Debates on Bills:**
   - MPs debate proposed legislation in detail during the three readings of a bill.
   - Committees often conduct detailed scrutiny, but debates in the House ensure accountability.

4. **Special Discussions and Motions:**
   - Short-Duration Discussions: For urgent national issues.
   - Adjournment Motions: To discuss specific issues requiring immediate attention.
   - No-Confidence Motion: Used by the opposition to test the government's majority.

---

### **Is Real Debate Happening in Parliament?**

#### **Concerns:**
1. **Disruptions and Walkouts:**
   - Parliamentary sessions are frequently disrupted due to protests by opposition parties or disagreements with the ruling party.
   - Walkouts and adjournments often result in significant time loss.

2. **Declining Time Spent on Legislative Business:**
   - More time is spent on political rhetoric than substantive discussion.
   - Important bills are sometimes passed without adequate debate or in haste.

3. **Lack of Depth:**
   - Discussions often lack data-driven arguments and analytical rigor.
   - Partisan biases overshadow the focus on public interest.

4. **Undermining Committees:**
   - Parliamentary standing and select committees are bypassed in some cases, leading to inadequate scrutiny of bills.

---

### **Reasons for Decline in Parliamentary Debate**

1. **Partisan Polarization:**
   - Increasing political divisions hinder constructive dialogue.
   - MPs prioritize party loyalty over critical evaluation.

2. **Populist Politics:**
   - Parliament is often used as a stage for populist statements to gain public attention rather than addressing issues.

3. **Lack of Preparation:**
   - Many MPs do not come adequately prepared with research or data.
   - Focus on media soundbites takes precedence over meaningful contributions.

4. **Time Constraints:**
   - A growing number of issues compete for limited parliamentary time.
   - This leads to truncation of debates or passing of bills via voice vote.

---

### **Suggestions to Improve Parliamentary Debates**

1. **Strengthen Parliamentary Committees:**
   - Ensure all major bills are referred to committees for detailed scrutiny.
   - Committees should invite expert opinions and stakeholders.

2. **Strict Enforcement of Rules:**
   - Discourage disruptions and ensure strict adherence to parliamentary norms.
   - Penalties for MPs engaging in repeated disruptions could be considered.

3. **Increase Working Hours:**
   - Parliament should sit longer and more frequently to provide ample time for debates.

4. **Capacity Building for MPs:**
   - Organize workshops to improve research skills and legislative drafting.
   - Provide access to research assistants and resources.

5. **Encourage Constructive Bipartisanship:**
   - Introduce mechanisms for better collaboration between ruling and opposition parties.
   - Pre-session consultations to decide the agenda can reduce friction.

6. **Leverage Technology:**
   - Digital platforms for live public engagement and suggestions during debates.
   - Use AI for tracking and summarizing debates to measure productivity.

7. **Increase Public Accountability:**
   - Regular publication of debate transcripts with MP attendance and participation data.
   - Public forums to evaluate the effectiveness of MPs.

---

### **Conclusion**

Debates in the Indian Parliament are crucial for the health of democracy but have increasingly become less substantive and more polarized. While tools like Question Hour and Zero Hour exist to ensure government accountability, their potential is undermined by disruptions and partisan politics. By enforcing discipline, strengthening committees, and fostering bipartisanship, Parliament can reclaim its role as the forum for meaningful debate and policy-making.

> Debates in the Indian Parliament, vital for democracy, are declining in effectiveness due to disruptions, polarization, and inadequate preparation by MPs. Tools like Question Hour and Zero Hour, designed for accountability, often fall victim to partisan politics and time constraints. Key concerns include hurried legislation, bypassing committees, and lack of substantive discussion. To improve, Parliament should strengthen committees, enforce rules, increase working hours, build MPs' capacities, promote bipartisanship, leverage technology, and ensure public accountability. These measures will foster meaningful debates, enhance transparency, and restore Parliament’s role as a platform for constructive policy-making and governance.

The 1924 Belgaum session of the Indian National Congress (INC) holds a unique place in India's freedom struggle as it was the only session presided over by Mahatma Gandhi. Held from December 26 to 28, it marked a pivotal moment in reinforcing Gandhi’s philosophy and leadership in the national movement.

The session came at a critical time when the Non-Cooperation Movement had been suspended following the Chauri Chaura incident (1922), which led to violence. Many within the Congress were questioning the strategy of non-violence, and the Swaraj Party, led by C.R. Das and Motilal Nehru, had been formed to contest elections and work from within the legislative councils.

Under Gandhi's leadership, the session emphasized the need for unity within the Congress. He refocused the organization on his constructive program, which included promoting Khadi (hand-spun cloth), self-reliance, and village industries. Gandhi also reiterated his commitment to non-violence and truth as essential tools in the fight for freedom.

The session symbolized Gandhi’s ability to steer the Congress towards his vision of swaraj (self-rule) rooted in the principles of self-sufficiency and non-violence. It also showcased his unifying influence in bridging the differences between moderates and Swarajists within the party.

The inauguration of 33 exclusive clinics for transgender individuals in India represents a significant step toward addressing the unique healthcare needs of the transgender community. These clinics aim to provide specialized services in a supportive environment, acknowledging the distinct challenges faced by transgender persons.

**Challenges Faced by Transgender Individuals:**

1. **Social Stigma and Discrimination:**
   - Transgender individuals often encounter societal prejudice, leading to exclusion from family and community.
   - Such discrimination can result in limited access to education, employment, and housing.

2. **Economic Marginalization:**
   - Due to widespread discrimination, many transgender persons are compelled to engage in sex work or begging for survival. 

3. **Healthcare Barriers:**
   - Transgender individuals frequently face discrimination within healthcare settings, leading to inadequate medical care.
   - There is a lack of healthcare professionals trained to address transgender-specific health issues.

4. **Legal Challenges:**
   - Despite legal advancements, transgender persons often struggle with bureaucratic hurdles in obtaining identity documents that reflect their gender identity.

**Government Initiatives and Legal Framework:**

1. **The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019:**
   - This Act prohibits discrimination against transgender individuals in education, employment, and healthcare.
   - It recognizes the right to self-perceived gender identity and mandates the issuance of identity certificates.

# Citizens with disabilities, making their rights real

### Disability in India: A Critical Analysis

India's approach to addressing the rights and needs of persons with disabilities (PwDs) has evolved over the years, marked by policy reforms, international commitments, and legislative changes. Despite progress, significant gaps remain in recognizing the true scale of disability and ensuring adequate measures to promote inclusivity.

---

### **Disability Statistics: Underestimated and Unaddressed**

According to the 2011 Census, persons with disabilities constitute only 2.21% of India's total population, a figure criticized as a severe underestimation. In contrast, the 2019 Brief Disability Model Survey conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO) found that 16% of Indian adults experience severe disability. This stark difference highlights systemic issues in identifying and documenting disabilities, including stigma, lack of awareness, and inconsistent methodologies.

---

### **International Commitments**

India ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) on October 1, 2007. The UNCRPD emphasizes the shift from a medical model of disability, which views disabilities as problems to be fixed, to a social and human rights-based model, which focuses on eliminating societal barriers and empowering PwDs.

As a state party to the convention, India is obligated to align its national disability legislation with UNCRPD principles. This requires addressing discrimination, ensuring accessibility, and fostering equal opportunities for PwDs across all spheres of life.

---

### **The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016**

The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPWD Act) replaced the outdated Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995. The RPWD Act represents a major legislative overhaul, introducing several significant changes:

1. **Broader Definition of Disability:**
   - The RPWD Act expands the definition of disability from 7 to 21 categories, including autism, cerebral palsy, dwarfism, multiple sclerosis, and mental illness. It also allows for periodic revision of the list.

2. **Emphasis on Accessibility:**
   - The Act mandates universal accessibility in physical infrastructure, transportation, information, and communication technologies.

3. **Reservation and Employment Opportunities:**
   - Reservation in government jobs for PwDs was increased from 3% to 4%.
   - Emphasis on skill development and inclusive workplaces.

4. **Education and Social Inclusion:**
   - The Act guarantees inclusive education and prohibits discrimination in educational institutions.
   - Focus on community participation and independent living.

5. **Penal Provisions:**
   - Stringent penalties for discrimination and denial of rights to PwDs.

---

### **Challenges in Implementation**

Despite the progressive framework of the RPWD Act, implementation has been slow and uneven. Key challenges include:

1. **Awareness and Advocacy:**
   - Low public awareness about disability rights and entitlements hampers advocacy efforts.

2. **Infrastructural Gaps:**
   - Accessibility standards are often ignored in urban planning and public infrastructure development.

3. **Employment Barriers:**
   - High unemployment rates among PwDs reflect systemic discrimination and lack of inclusive workplaces.

4. **Data Discrepancies:**
   - Accurate and comprehensive data on disabilities is essential for effective policymaking but remains inadequate.

---

### **Way Forward**

1. **Awareness Campaigns:**
   - Nationwide campaigns to educate citizens about disability rights and the RPWD Act.

2. **Capacity Building:**
   - Training programs for government officials, educators, and employers to implement inclusive practices.

3. **Enhanced Data Collection:**
   - Regular and comprehensive disability surveys to address data gaps.

4. **Strengthening Enforcement:**
   - Strict monitoring and penalties for non-compliance with accessibility and inclusion mandates.

---

### **Conclusion**

India’s commitment to the rights of persons with disabilities has improved with the RPWD Act, aligning national laws with international standards. However, effective implementation, greater public awareness, and systemic changes are necessary to ensure PwDs enjoy equal opportunities and a dignified life. By addressing these gaps, India can foster a truly inclusive society that upholds the human rights of all its citizens.

> India's approach to disability rights has evolved with the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPWD Act), replacing the outdated 1995 law to align with the UNCRPD's principles. While the 2011 Census underreported persons with disabilities at 2.21% of the population, the WHO's 2019 survey estimates severe disability prevalence among Indian adults at 16%. The RPWD Act expands the definition of disability, enhances accessibility, increases reservations in jobs, and ensures inclusive education. However, challenges like poor awareness, infrastructural gaps, and inadequate data hinder progress. Strengthened enforcement, advocacy, and inclusive practices are essential for fostering equality and dignity for persons with disabilities.

# India’s ‘One Nation, One Subscription’ plan

The Union Cabinet approved the Indian government’s ‘One Nation, One Subscription’ (ONOS) scheme on November 25. The ONOS promises to provide equitable access to scholarly journals in all public institutions.

### What does the ONOS entail?

First mooted around 2018-2019, the scheme’s ambitious rollout comes with a substantial financial outlay of ₹6,000 crore over three years (2025-2027), to be paid to 30 major international journal publishers. For perspective, the Indian public and its academic institutions collectively spend around ₹1,500 crore every year on journal subscriptions. This is a rough estimate and probably includes the cost of subscription to databases as well; if so, the current total public expense to access journals will be well lower than ₹2,000 crore per year.

At the outset, ONOS’s promise to offer equitable access to research articles, irrespective of an institution’s prestige or financial capacity, which seems like a step towards democratising knowledge. But a closer examination reveals complexities that call for deeper analysis.

### Is ONOS swimming against the tide?

The central question is: why is India investing heavily in a subscription-based model at a time when the global research ecosystem is increasingly embracing Open-Access (OA) publishing?

In the subscription model, a journal receives manuscripts from scientists (about their studies, etc.), evaluates them through peer review, and accepts (or rejects) them. Once a paper is accepted, the journal publishes it and makes money by charging people and institutions to access it. OA refers to papers that are published to be freely accessible. There are different kinds of OA. A common type is called gold OA, where the journal makes money by charging authors an article processing charge (APC) to publish papers in the journal. The APC for a single paper has been known to be thousands of dollars. For example, Nature Communications charges $6,790 per paper. Scientific knowledge, as a public good, should ideally be accessible to all, especially when taxpayers fund it. The COVID-19 pandemic showed why it is important to have immediate and unrestricted access to research, not just for scientists but also for the people at large: to combat misinformation and drive informed decision-making.

Today, more than 53% of all scientific papers worldwide are open access in some way, according to data from Clarivate’s Web Of Science platform. This is a significant increase since 2018-2019, when ONOS was first conceptualised, and raises questions about ONOS’s financial prudence. If more than half of the research articles are freely accessible, should India not be paying significantly less for subscriptions than before? ONOS risks draining taxpayer money to achieve an obsolete good.

Some international developments further complicate the picture. The U.S. Office of Science and Technology Policy has mandated that from 2026, all publicly funded research articles must be freely accessible without any delay. Similarly, Horizon Europe, the European Union’s flagship funding program, requires peer-reviewed publications resulting from its funding be made freely available online. Considering these moves, in another year a significant fraction of research produced worldwide is likely to be freely accessible to everyone.

This timeline raises questions about ONOS’s relevance beyond 2025.

### What are the challenges of commercial publishing?

The global scholarly publishing system is dominated by a handful of commercial publishers based in Western countries, and they have long been criticised for excessive subscription fees, inefficiencies resulting in delays in publishing articles, and resistance to innovation.

The scholarly publishing industry is built on publicly funded research. Researchers generate new knowledge, write their findings, and perform peer reviews — all without direct compensation from publishers. In the subscription model, these publishers charge exorbitant fees for access, creating a situation where public institutions must pay to access work they have already supported. Publisher profit margins often exceed 30%, revealing the exploitation implicit to scholarly publishing systems.

Even the shift towards OA has been dominated by gold OA and its high APCs. Many prominent journals in a few disciplines, such as biological science, have transitioned to become fully OA. Indian researchers wishing to publish in these journals will have to pay APCs since the allocation for ONOS doesn’t provide for this fee. Moreover, most subscription journals are now hybrid, so researchers — especially from the U.S. and the EU — are paying APCs to publish their articles to be OA in these journals.

India, with its immense pool of talent and resources, has the potential to reimagine this publishing ecosystem, fostering innovation in the workflow. Especially when most of the backend work in the publishing industry is outsourced to India, the infrastructure and knowhow definitely exist in the national ecosystem. But ONOS risks entrenching the status quo by reinforcing reliance on Western publishers.

### What about copyright transfers?

Another significant issue with the subscription model is the need for researchers to surrender their copyrights to publishers. This allows publishers to use their work without considering the authors’ rights or consent. A recent controversy involving Taylor & Francis (T&F) and Microsoft exemplifies the extent of this problem. In early 2024, T&F had signed a deal allowing Microsoft to use its journal content to train artificial intelligence (AI) models. Since authors don’t hold the copyright of their work, there is no need for permission from authors — yet they objected because the use of their work to train AI models was going unpaid. There is an urgent need for policies that protect researchers’ intellectual property.

There are ways to address copyright violation concerns. Harvard University pioneered a policy in 2008 that granted the university a non-exclusive, irrevocable right to disseminate the work of university researchers. Researchers retained the right to self-archive their work in OA repositories. Many institutes like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Oxford followed suit. ONOS has the opportunity to emulate these models by incorporating a nationwide ‘rights retention’ policy, enabling Indian researchers to deposit their work in institutional repositories immediately after publication — a practice known as green open access.

India’s own 2014 Open Access Policy requires researchers funded by the Departments of Biotechnology and of Science & Technology to make their work openly accessible — but its implementation has been lacklustre. The ONOS could have been the ideal platform to enforce this mandate, ensuring Indian research becomes globally accessible through open repositories immediately after publication.

### Is digital content preserved?

Another issue is the long-term preservation of research articles, now that almost all major journals are published online. A recent study in the Journal of Librarianship and Scholarly Communication reported that 28% of articles with Data Object Identifiers (DOIs) — unique IDs to identify published papers — aren’t preserved, exposing gaps in current practices. The discontinuation of Heterocycles, a journal published by the Japan Institute of Heterocyclic Chemistry, in 2023 left around 17,000 articles inaccessible, highlighting the risks of relying solely on publishers to preserve scientific knowledge. In this case access was eventually restored, but the delay illustrates the need for solutions like self-archiving through green OA.

### Is self-reliance possible in publishing?

In an era where self-reliance is a national priority, it has been overlooked in scholarly publishing. While Indian researchers may continue publishing in journals like Nature, Science, Cell, etc., significant potential exists to elevate Indian journals to world-class standards.

India has the resources and expertise to build a robust indigenous publishing ecosystem. Preprinting and data sharing should also be considered as an integral part of the publishing workflow (preprinting refers to a paper being published online before it has been peer-reviewed). By investing in infrastructure, editorial processes, and global visibility for Indian journals, the country can reduce its dependence on Western publishers and attract high-quality submissions from across the world. This is not just about the money being drained from our ecosystem: it’s also about establishing India as a leader in science and innovation.

### What could ONOS have done?

ONOS can be lauded for its ambition to democratise research access, but it should have addressed deeper structural issues plaguing scholarly publishing. There should have been parallel efforts to allow authors to retain copyright, implement OA through institutional repositories, and, importantly, improve self-reliance in scholarly publishing.

Given the allocation ONOS has received from the Indian government, it certainly had the potential to set a precedent for equitable and innovative publishing by addressing all the issues in parallel — yet it chose to overlook them. Without addressing these challenges, ONOS risks becoming a costly short-term fix. It is time to re-evaluate whether this initiative is a step forward or an expensive detour.

> India’s "One Nation, One Subscription" plan aims to provide equitable access to a vast array of academic and research resources, including journals, e-books, and databases, for all citizens. Spearheaded by the Indian government, the initiative envisions centralized procurement of digital resources to ensure affordability and eliminate paywalls for researchers, students, and institutions across the country. This move seeks to democratize knowledge, boost research output, and reduce dependency on costly international subscriptions. By fostering inclusivity and enhancing access to global knowledge, the plan aspires to transform India's academic and innovation landscape, promoting a culture of learning and discovery nationwide.
