# The Constitution might be a unifier, but the debate exposed polarisation

### **What is the Constitution?**  

The **Constitution** is the supreme law of a country that lays down the fundamental principles, values, and framework for the functioning of the government and the rights of its citizens. It acts as a **social contract** between the government and the people, defining the powers, duties, and limitations of each branch of the state—**the legislature, executive, and judiciary**. In essence, the Constitution ensures a system of governance based on law, justice, equality, and liberty.  



In the case of **India**, the Constitution is a comprehensive document adopted on **January 26, 1950**, which marked the birth of the Republic of India. Drafted under the leadership of **Dr. B.R. Ambedkar**, it reflects the aspirations of a newly independent nation. The **Preamble** of the Indian Constitution encapsulates its core principles—sovereignty, socialism, secularism, democracy, justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity.  



The Indian Constitution is unique in its adaptability, combining **rigidity and flexibility**. While some provisions can only be amended through a special majority (rigid), others allow for easier amendments (flexible). This makes it a **"living document"**, enabling it to evolve with time to meet changing societal needs.  



---



### **What is Constitutionalism?**  

**Constitutionalism** refers to the idea that **government power must be limited and exercised within the boundaries set by the Constitution**. It emphasizes governance based on the rule of law, where the authority of the state is constrained to prevent the misuse of power. Unlike the mere existence of a written Constitution, constitutionalism focuses on the **spirit and values** enshrined in it, ensuring that governments operate for the people and not against them.  



### **Key Features of Constitutionalism**:  

1. **Limited Government**: Power is not absolute and is restricted through laws and institutions.  

2. **Rule of Law**: All individuals, including those in power, are subject to the law. No one is above it.  

3. **Separation of Powers**: Dividing power among the legislature, executive, and judiciary prevents concentration and abuse of power.  

4. **Fundamental Rights**: Constitutionalism guarantees citizens’ rights and freedoms, protecting them from state overreach.  

5. **Accountability and Transparency**: Governments are accountable to the people through checks and balances.  

6. **Judicial Review**: The judiciary ensures laws and actions of the government conform to constitutional provisions.  



In India, constitutionalism is reflected in the principles of **democracy, secularism, federalism, and the protection of fundamental rights**. The judiciary plays a crucial role in upholding constitutionalism through mechanisms like **judicial review** and interpretation of laws.  



---



### **Constitution vs. Constitutionalism**  

While the **Constitution** is a legal document that establishes the framework of governance, **constitutionalism** is its ethical and philosophical foundation that ensures governments act responsibly and justly. For example:  

- **The Emergency of 1975** showed how the Constitution could be misused to centralize power.  

- Post-Emergency, constitutional amendments and judicial activism reinforced constitutionalism by strengthening fundamental rights and democracy.  



---



### **The Importance of Constitutionalism**  

Constitutionalism ensures that democracy thrives, individual freedoms are protected, and governments remain accountable. It upholds the sanctity of the Constitution as a dynamic, living document that adapts to changing times while remaining rooted in justice, equality, and liberty.  

By balancing **power** and **freedom**, constitutionalism creates a just, pluralistic society where both the government and citizens operate within defined moral and legal boundaries.

> The **Constitution** is the supreme law that establishes the framework for governance, defines powers, and ensures citizens' rights. It acts as a social contract, ensuring justice, equality, and liberty. **Constitutionalism**, on the other hand, emphasizes limiting government power within constitutional boundaries, ensuring accountability, rule of law, separation of powers, and protection of fundamental rights. It reflects the spirit of democracy and prevents misuse of authority. While the Constitution is a written document, constitutionalism ensures its ethical and philosophical application. Together, they create a dynamic, adaptable system that upholds justice, safeguards individual freedoms, and strengthens democracy for a progressive society.

# Levy a higher GST rate on tobacco, sugared beverages

Over the past seven years, since the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), there have been no significant increases in GST rates on harmful products such as tobacco and sugar-sweetened beverages, except for two minor hikes in National Calamity Contingent Duties (NCCD) on tobacco. This has made these products more affordable, undermining efforts to curb their consumption. In this context, the proposal by the Group of Ministers (GoM) to raise the highest GST tier on tobacco and sugar-sweetened beverages from 28% to 35% is a welcome step. However, further tax reforms are essential to effectively tackle the public health and fiscal challenges associated with these products.



### Impact of proposed GST rate hike



India is the second-largest consumer of tobacco globally, with 28.6% of adults above 15 years and 8.5% of students aged 13 to 15 years using tobacco in some form. Tobacco is a leading risk factor for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and causes over 3,500 daily deaths in India. In 2017, the annual economic burden of tobacco use and second-hand smoke was estimated at ₹2,340 billion, or 1.4% of GDP — far exceeding the ₹538 billion collected annually in tobacco tax revenue.



The proposed GST hike to 35% is expected to reduce tobacco consumption and boost tax revenues. Preliminary estimates suggest the 35% rate would lead to a 5.5% price increase, a 5% drop in consumption, and an 18.6% revenue rise for beedis. For cigarettes, prices would increase by 3.9%, consumption decline by 1.3%, and revenue grow by 6.4%. Smokeless tobacco prices would rise by 3%, consumption drop by 2.7%, and revenue increase by 1.9%. Overall, this could generate an additional ₹43 billion annually, provided the industry does not “over-shift” the tax burden, which can result in excess profits at the expense of government revenue and public health.



The GoM’s recommendation to raise GST rates to 35% is a positive step but falls short of the 40% peak rate allowed under GST law. A 40% rate would have a greater impact, leading to sharper price increases, larger consumption reductions, and an additional ₹72 billion in revenue. It would also lower the risk of the industry over-shifting the tax burden. Currently, the tax burden on tobacco products is uneven, with taxes accounting for only 22% of the retail price of beedis, while it accounts for 49.5% for cigarettes and 64% for smokeless tobacco. The 35% GST rate would narrow this gap slightly, raising their respective tax shares to 26%, 51%, and 65%, but a 40% rate could reduce this disparity further. The World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC), to which India is a signatory, recommends that all tobacco products be taxed comparably to prevent substitution between them.



Concerns from the tobacco industry about increased illicit trade due to higher taxes are unfounded. Evidence, including from India, shows that tax hikes have minimal impact on illicit trade. Instead, factors such as tax administration quality, regulatory frameworks, government commitment, governance strength, social acceptance, and informal distribution networks play a far more significant role in determining the scale of illicit markets.



### Balancing GST and excise taxes



Another key issue is the reliance on GST, a purely ad valorem tax, to regulate tobacco consumption. Ad valorem taxes are less effective than specific excise taxes in curbing tobacco use as they are tied to product prices, which the industry can manipulate. Since the introduction of GST, the share of excise taxes in total tobacco taxation has declined, reducing the tax system’s effectiveness in discouraging tobacco use. Many countries with GST or value-added tax (VAT) supplement these with specific excise duties on harmful products such as tobacco. India should consider raising excise taxes alongside the GST revision for a stronger and more comprehensive taxation framework.



While much of the public discourse has focused on tobacco, the proposed GST hike on sugar-sweetened beverages is equally significant. Excessive consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages is a major contributor to obesity, diabetes, and other NCDs. Increasing the GST rate to 35% could discourage consumption and align with India’s broader public health goals. However, the government should also consider introducing additional health-focused levies, such as a specific excise tax on sugar-sweetened beverages, to further strengthen the tax framework.



### Key considerations for GST Council



As the GST Council considers the GoM’s recommendations, it should use this opportunity to reform the taxation of harmful products. Raising GST rates to 40% for tobacco and sugar-sweetened beverages would enhance public health benefits while aligning with the peak rate under GST law. Pairing this with higher excise taxes would create a mixed tax structure, proven more effective at reducing consumption than relying predominantly on ad valorem taxes. Reducing the discrepancy in tax burden between beedis, cigarettes, and smokeless tobacco is also crucial to discourage substitution and follow global best practices. These steps could significantly reduce the health and economic impacts of tobacco and sugar-sweetened beverages while generating vital revenue for development.



### **Goods and Services Tax (GST) – Introduction**  

The **Goods and Services Tax (GST)** is a comprehensive, multi-stage, destination-based **indirect tax** that has replaced many indirect taxes in India. Implemented on **July 1, 2017**, GST unifies the entire nation into a single market by replacing a complex system of central and state taxes. It is levied on the **supply of goods and services**, from the point of production to consumption.  



---



### **Key Features of GST**  

1. **Comprehensive**: GST covers all goods and services except alcohol for human consumption, petroleum products, and electricity (which are taxed under the old system).  

2. **Multi-Stage**: GST is applicable at every stage of the supply chain—manufacturing, wholesale, retail, and final consumption.  

3. **Destination-Based**: Tax is collected by the state where goods and services are consumed rather than where they are produced.  

4. **Dual Structure**: GST is levied by both the Centre and States:  

   - **CGST**: Central Goods and Services Tax (levied by the Central Government).  

   - **SGST**: State Goods and Services Tax (levied by the State Government).  

   - **IGST**: Integrated Goods and Services Tax (on inter-state supplies).

---



### **GST Slabs**  

The GST regime follows **four main tax slabs**:  

- **5%**: Essential items like food, transportation services.  

- **12%**: Processed food, electronics, and other items.  

- **18%**: Standard rate for most goods and services (e.g., restaurants, telecom).  

- **28%**: Luxury items, tobacco, and sin goods.  



Certain items are exempted from GST or taxed at **0%** (e.g., unbranded food grains, fresh vegetables, milk).  



---



### **Advantages of GST**  

1. **One Nation, One Tax**: GST eliminates cascading effects and ensures a unified market.  

2. **Simplified Tax Structure**: Combines multiple taxes into one, reducing compliance burden.  

3. **Eliminates Cascading Effect**: Tax is levied only on the value addition at each stage, reducing the overall tax burden.  

4. **Transparency**: GST invoices show the exact amount of tax paid at each stage.  

5. **Increased Compliance**: Input tax credit incentivizes businesses to comply with GST.  

6. **Boosts Revenue**: Streamlined taxation and wider tax base increase revenue collection.  



---



### **Disadvantages of GST**  

1. **Higher Compliance Burden**: Small businesses may struggle with regular filing and technology requirements.  

2. **Increased Prices**: In the initial stages, GST caused price hikes in some sectors.  

3. **Technical Challenges**: GST is IT-driven, which may disadvantage businesses without technological infrastructure.  

4. **Multiple Tax Slabs**: Complexity remains due to the existence of different slabs.  

5. **Petroleum Products Exclusion**: Excluding petroleum, alcohol, and electricity prevents a truly unified tax system.  



---



### **GST and the Constitution**  

The GST was introduced through the **101st Constitutional Amendment Act**. Key constitutional provisions include:  

- **Article 246A**: Gives concurrent powers to the Centre and States to levy GST.  

- **Article 269A**: Governs the distribution of IGST revenue between Centre and States.  

- **Article 279A**: Provides for the formation of the GST Council.  



---

Businesses are required to file periodic GST returns:  

1. **GSTR-1**: Details of outward supplies (sales).  

2. **GSTR-2A**: Auto-populated details of inward supplies (purchases).  

3. **GSTR-3B**: Monthly summary return.  

4. **Annual Return**: Consolidated details of the year.  



---



### **Impact of GST on the Indian Economy**  

1. **Increased Tax Revenue**: By expanding the tax base and ensuring compliance, GST has improved revenue collection.  

2. **Ease of Doing Business**: A single tax structure reduces barriers to inter-state trade.  

3. **Formalization of the Economy**: GST discourages the informal economy as it requires proper invoicing and returns.  

4. **Sectoral Impact**: While service industries faced increased tax rates initially, manufacturing sectors benefited from the elimination of cascading taxes.  



---



### **Challenges in GST Implementation**

2. **High Compliance for SMEs**: Small businesses find it challenging to file multiple returns.  

3. **Revenue Shortfall**: Some states face short-term revenue losses, necessitating compensation from the Centre.  

4. **Awareness and Training**: Lack of understanding among traders, especially in rural areas, remains a concern.  



---



### **Conclusion**  

GST has been a landmark reform in India’s taxation system, aligning it with global standards. While it faced initial challenges like compliance burden and technical issues, GST has successfully streamlined indirect taxes, reduced cascading effects, and promoted economic integration. Continuous reforms and technological advancements are essential to address existing challenges and ensure GST’s success as a **"Good and Simple Tax"**.

> The GST Council is considering a proposal to increase GST rates on **tobacco products** and **sugared beverages** to curb their consumption and generate additional revenue. Tobacco, already classified under the 28% tax slab with additional cess, remains a major public health concern. Sugared beverages, contributing to rising obesity and diabetes cases, are also under scrutiny for higher taxation. The move aligns with public health goals to discourage harmful consumption patterns while boosting government finances. Such measures can reduce healthcare costs associated with lifestyle diseases and promote healthier choices among consumers, balancing fiscal and social objectives effectively.

# Green hydrogen and the financing challenge

### Green Hydrogen and the Financing Challenge  



Green hydrogen, produced using renewable energy sources like solar and wind to split water into hydrogen and oxygen through electrolysis, is emerging as a key solution for decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors such as steel, cement, shipping, and aviation. Unlike grey and blue hydrogen, which rely on fossil fuels, green hydrogen has zero carbon emissions, making it an essential part of the global transition to clean energy.  



However, financing green hydrogen projects remains a significant challenge. While the technology is promising, it is still in its nascent stage and has several economic and infrastructural barriers. Green hydrogen production involves high capital costs due to the expensive electrolysers and renewable energy infrastructure required. Additionally, the cost of green hydrogen (approximately **$3-6 per kilogram**) is considerably higher compared to grey hydrogen, which is cheaper due to reliance on fossil fuels.  



Another financial hurdle is the lack of an established market for green hydrogen. Industries remain hesitant to adopt green hydrogen due to the high upfront costs, uncertainty in demand, and lack of incentives. This market uncertainty deters private investors from committing significant resources to green hydrogen projects.  



To overcome these challenges, governments and financial institutions must play a critical role. Policy incentives like production-linked subsidies, tax benefits, and viability gap funding can reduce initial investment risks. Countries like **India**, under its **National Green Hydrogen Mission**, aim to produce 5 million metric tons of green hydrogen annually by 2030 through targeted support. Similarly, green financing mechanisms such as **green bonds**, concessional loans, and public-private partnerships (PPP) can mobilize the required capital.  



Technological advancements to improve the efficiency of electrolysers and reduce renewable energy costs are also crucial to making green hydrogen competitive. Establishing a robust **infrastructure** for storage, transportation, and distribution will further lower costs and encourage adoption.  



In conclusion, while green hydrogen holds the promise of revolutionizing clean energy transitions, financing its growth remains a challenge due to high production costs, lack of demand, and market uncertainties. Strategic policy interventions, financial incentives, and innovations in technology are critical to addressing these barriers. With coordinated efforts between governments, investors, and industries, green hydrogen can become a cornerstone of global decarbonization goals.

# How does La Niña affect India’s climate?

While the La Niña was expected to emerge by July this year, it is yet to. The India Meteorological Department now expects a La Niña to set in by late 2024 or early 2025, plus a milder winter due to this delay.



### What is La Niña?



La Niña, a phase of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), occurs when the region of the Pacific Ocean between Indonesia and South America is cooler than usual. Its counterpart, El Niño, represents a warming of the same region. These two phases significantly influence global atmospheric circulation and weather patterns. During La Niña years, India receives normal or above-normal rainfall during the monsoon season. Yet the same phenomenon causes droughts in Africa and intensifies hurricanes over the Atlantic Ocean. Conversely, the El Niño brings extreme summers and droughts in India while increasing rainfall in the southern U.S.



This decade began with three consecutive La Niña events (2020-2022), a rare occurrence known as Triple Dip La Niña, followed by an El Niño in 2023. Climate change may increase the frequency and intensity of both La Niña and El Niño events, as rising sea and land temperatures disrupt the Pacific’s balance. This could also amplify extreme La Niña events, which generally lead to harsh winters in India.



### Will a La Niña emerge this winter?



2024 is different; the La Niña has not emerged as expected. Historically, the La Niña has usually formed during the monsoon or the pre-monsoon period, and it has formed only twice between October and December since 1950. Global forecasts had also predicted its emergence this monsoon. But in December, there remains only a 57% chance of it forming in 2024. It will be weak if it still does but it could affect global weather.



The onset of La Niña or El Niño can be declared on the basis of many indices. For instance, the oceanic Niño index (ONI) compares the three-month average sea surface temperatures in the East-Central Tropical Pacific with the 30-year average. When the difference between the two is 0.5º C or higher, it is an El Niño, and when it is –0.5º C or lower, it is a La Niña. Currently, it is around –0.3º C. To be classified as a full-fledged La Niña or El Niño, ONI values need to exceed the thresholds at least five times consecutively.



### What is the meteorology?



Cities in southern India like Bengaluru and Hyderabad are experiencing a colder than usual winter this year, while north India is witnessing a delayed winter with above-normal temperatures. Some reports have linked the southern chill to a La Niña, but the current ONI values suggest otherwise. Had a La Niña developed already, north India would likely be experiencing a colder winter than usual.



An analysis of meteorological data over 35 years by researchers at the Council on Energy Environment and Water, New Delhi, has revealed that while La Niña winters feature colder nights compared to El Niño, daytime temperatures tend to be higher. Meteorological parameters like wind speed and planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) — the lowest atmospheric layer directly influenced by land-atmosphere interactions — also vary during ENSO phases, affecting air quality.



The team found the average wind speed is higher throughout the day during La Niña winters. Faster winds help reduce air pollution by transporting pollutants away. They also found that the average PBLH is slightly lower during La Niña winters. If La Niña sets in, lower temperatures in north India may lead people to burn more biomass for heating, worsening air pollution. A lower PBLH could also trap more pollutants near the ground. But higher wind speeds could disperse the pollutants, potentially leading to better air quality.



### What about La Niña and monsoons?



El Niño summers are relatively harsher, as was the case in April this year, when India experienced intense, record-breaking heat waves. If a La Niña arrives and persists into the summer of 2025, it may offer relief from high heat. Additionally, an El Niño often disrupts monsoons, with India historically receiving below-average rainfall during at least half of all El Niño years since 1871. But the same figures also indicate evolving patterns since 1980.



Both north and south India, for instance, have received less rainfall during more intense El Nino events while central India has been barely affected. A La Niña, on the other hand, promotes robust monsoons as evidenced by the “normal” or “above-normal” rainfall in the La Niña years of 2020, 2021, and 2022. There were “below normal” rains in the El Niño year of 2023.



Thus it would be a welcome development if a La Niña forms now or early next year and continues until the monsoon season.

> **La Niña** is a climatic phenomenon that occurs when sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean become cooler than average. In India, La Niña typically results in **above-average monsoon rainfall**, as the cooler ocean temperatures strengthen the Indian Ocean monsoon circulation. This often leads to **flooding**, especially in the northeastern states and along the east coast. Conversely, La Niña can cause **drought conditions** in some areas, particularly in the western and southern parts of India, by disrupting normal weather patterns. Overall, its impacts are complex and vary depending on regional factors.

# What is the procedure for removing judges?

Fifty-five MPs of the Rajya Sabha have submitted a motion, for removing Allahabad High Court Judge, Justice Shekhar Kumar Yadav, to Chairman of the Rajya Sabha.



### What is the procedure for removal?



**Articles 124 and 217 of the Constitution** provide that a judge of the Supreme Court/High Court shall be removed by the President, on the grounds of **‘proved misbehaviour’ or ‘incapacity’** after a motion is passed in each House of Parliament by a majority of the total membership of that House and by a majority of not less than two thirds of the members of that House present and voting (special majority) in the same session. The Constitution does not define the terms ‘proved misbehaviour’ or ‘incapacity.’ The Supreme Court has opined in various cases that wilful misconduct in office, corruption, lack of integrity or any other offence involving moral turpitude would constitute **misbehaviour**. Incapacity here means a medical condition that may include physical or mental incapacity.



The detailed procedure for removal is provided in the **Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968**. It stipulates that a notice of motion for removal should be signed by not less than **50 members in the Rajya Sabha and 100 members in the Lok Sabha**. The Chairman or Speaker may after due consideration and consultation admit or refuse to admit the motion. If admitted, a **three-member committee** will be constituted consisting of Supreme Court/High Court judges and a distinguished jurist. If the Committee, after investigation, absolves the judge of any misbehaviour or incapacity, the motion pending shall not be proceeded with. If found guilty of misbehaviour or suffering from incapacity, the committee report will be taken up in the Houses of Parliament which would then need to **pass the motion with special majority**.



### What is the current issue?



Justice Yadav made communally-charged remarks while speaking at an event organised by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad. He is reported to have said the country would be run according to the wishes of the majority. The ‘Reinstatement of Values of Judicial Life’ adopted by the Supreme Court in 1997, and followed by all the High Courts, mandates that behaviour and conduct of members of the higher judiciary must reaffirm people’s faith in the impartiality of the judiciary. The judges should not commit any act of omission or commission that is unbecoming of the high office they occupy. Notably, though the Judges (Inquiry) Bill, 2006 was not passed by the Parliament, it defined ‘misbehaviour’ to include violation of code of conduct for the judges. This bill proposed imposition of ‘minor measures,’ like issuing warnings, public or private censure, withdrawal of judicial work for a limited time etc., for misconduct that does not warrant removal.



### What is required?



The Blackstone’s ratio in criminal jurisprudence that ‘it is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer’ can be applied even when it comes to the removal of judges. The stringent process with the requirement of special majority in both houses has resulted in the non-removal of judges even after having been found guilty of misbehaviour by the inquiry committee. This is nevertheless essential to protect the independence of judges while discharging their duties. The Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, against whom himself a notice of motion for removal has been submitted, is unlikely to admit the present motion. The Supreme Court has issued a notice seeking details of the controversial speech made by Justice Yadav. The Judge is likely to appear before the Supreme Court Collegium to explain his stand. It is cardinal that Judges display behaviour that behoves the high constitutional office they hold.

> In India, the procedure for removing judges from the Supreme Court or High Courts is outlined in **Article 124(4)** and **Article 217(1)**. Judges can be removed through **impeachment**, which requires a motion to be introduced in either house of Parliament. The motion must be signed by at least **100 members in the Lok Sabha** or **50 members in the Rajya Sabha**. If both houses pass the motion by a **two-thirds majority**, the judge can be removed. The motion must be based on proven **misbehavior or incapacity**, and the process includes an inquiry by a committee of judges.
