# Special SC Bench will hear Places of Worship Act case

The **Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991** is a significant legislation in India that aims to maintain the religious character of places of worship as they existed on August 15, 1947. It prohibits the conversion of any place of worship and bars legal proceedings seeking to alter their status from that date. The Act, however, excludes the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute from its purview.

**Key Provisions of the Act:**

- **Section 3**: Prohibits the conversion of any place of worship from one religious denomination to another or even between different sects of the same religion.

- **Section 4**: Declares that the religious character of a place of worship as it existed on August 15, 1947, shall be maintained, and no legal proceedings shall be instituted to alter this status.

- **Section 5**: Specifies that the Act does not apply to the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute.

**Recent Developments:**

On December 7, 2024, the Supreme Court of India constituted a special three-judge bench to hear petitions challenging the constitutional validity of certain provisions of the Places of Worship Act. The bench, led by Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna and comprising Justices Sanjay Kumar and K.V. Viswanathan, is scheduled to hear the matter on December 12, 2024. 

**Background of the Legal Challenge:**

The petitions argue that Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Act infringe upon the right to judicial remedy and seek to reclaim places of worship. They contend that these provisions violate fundamental rights by restricting the ability to approach courts for disputes concerning religious places. Notably, one of the petitioners is advocate Ashwini Upadhyay, known for filing public interest litigations on various issues. 

**Government's Position:**

The Supreme Court had previously issued notices to the Central Government, seeking its response to the petitions challenging the Act. Despite multiple extensions, the Centre's detailed stance remains pending, prompting the Court to schedule a hearing to address the matter comprehensively. 

**Implications of the Case:**

The outcome of this case holds significant implications for India's secular fabric and communal harmony. Upholding the Act would reinforce the status quo of religious places as of 1947, potentially averting numerous legal disputes. Conversely, striking down or amending the Act could open avenues for litigation aimed at altering the religious character of various sites, potentially leading to communal tensions.

**Conclusion:**

The Supreme Court's decision to form a special bench underscores the importance and sensitivity of the issues surrounding the Places of Worship Act. As the hearing approaches, stakeholders and observers keenly await the Court's deliberations, recognizing that the verdict will have far-reaching consequences on India's approach to preserving the religious character of its diverse places of worship.

# Preventing malaria using genetically modified parasites

### **Malaria: An Overview**

Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by **Plasmodium parasites**, which are transmitted to humans through the bites of infected female **Anopheles mosquitoes**. It is most prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Africa, Asia, and South America.

---

### **Causes and Transmission**
1. **Parasites**: 
   - The disease is caused by five Plasmodium species:
     - *Plasmodium falciparum* (most deadly)
     - *Plasmodium vivax*
     - *Plasmodium malariae*
     - *Plasmodium ovale*
     - *Plasmodium knowlesi* (rare in humans)

2. **Transmission**:
   - The parasite is transmitted through the bite of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes.
   - Less common modes:
     - Blood transfusion
     - Sharing needles
     - Mother-to-child during childbirth

3. **Life Cycle**:
   - **Sporozoites** (infective stage) enter the bloodstream after a mosquito bite and travel to the liver.
   - Parasites multiply in liver cells, enter red blood cells, and further multiply, causing them to burst and release more parasites.

---

### **Symptoms**
- Fever and chills
- Headache and muscle aches
- Nausea and vomiting
- Sweating
- Fatigue
- Severe cases: cerebral malaria, anemia, organ failure, and death (mainly from *P. falciparum*).

---

### **Prevention**
1. **Mosquito Control**:
   - Use insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs).
   - Indoor residual spraying (IRS) with insecticides.
   - Eliminate stagnant water to prevent mosquito breeding.

2. **Preventive Medications**:
   - Prophylactic drugs for travelers and people in endemic areas.
   - Examples: Chloroquine, Doxycycline, and Mefloquine.

3. **Vaccination**:
   - Development of vaccines like RTS,S/AS01 (Mosquirix) and R21/Matrix-M.

---

### **Vaccines**
1. **RTS,S/AS01 (Mosquirix)**:
   - **Developed By**: GlaxoSmithKline (GSK).
   - **Approved**: 2021 by WHO.
   - **Target**: Effective against *Plasmodium falciparum*.
   - **Efficacy**: Provides around 30-40% protection; reduces severe cases and hospitalizations.
   - **Rollout**: Implemented in Ghana, Kenya, and Malawi.

2. **R21/Matrix-M**:
   - **Developed By**: University of Oxford.
   - **Approved**: 2023 by WHO.
   - **Target**: Focused on children and offers higher efficacy than Mosquirix (up to 75%).
   - **Rollout**: Launched in several African countries with expanded programs.

---

### **Genetic Approaches to Control Malaria**
1. **Sterile Insect Technique (SIT)**:
   - Release of radiation-sterilized male mosquitoes that cannot produce offspring, reducing mosquito populations.

2. **Gene Drives**:
   - Genetically engineered mosquitoes carry genes that prevent them from transmitting the parasite or reduce their survival.

3. **Wolbachia Bacteria**:
   - Infection of mosquitoes with Wolbachia bacteria reduces their ability to carry the Plasmodium parasite.

---

### **Treatment**
1. **Antimalarial Drugs**:
   - **Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies (ACTs)**: First-line treatment for *P. falciparum*.
     - Examples: Artemether-Lumefantrine, Artesunate-Amodiaquine.
   - **Chloroquine**: Effective for *P. vivax* in non-resistant areas.
   - **Primaquine**: Targets dormant liver stages of *P. vivax* and *P. ovale*.

2. **Supportive Care**:
   - Intravenous fluids for dehydration.
   - Blood transfusions for severe anemia.
   - Mechanical ventilation in cases of respiratory distress.

---

### **Global Efforts to Combat Malaria**
1. **WHO’s Global Technical Strategy (GTS) for Malaria (2016–2030)**:
   - Aim: Reduce malaria incidence and mortality rates by 90% by 2030.
   - Strategies: Prevention, rapid diagnosis, effective treatment, and strengthened health systems.

2. **Roll Back Malaria Partnership (RBM)**:
   - Aims to coordinate global efforts to control and eventually eliminate malaria.

3. **Funding Initiatives**:
   - Organizations like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation provide funding for malaria research and interventions.

---

### **Future Directions**
- Increased vaccine accessibility and improved efficacy.
- Expansion of genetic control methods like SIT and gene drives.
- Strengthening healthcare systems in endemic areas.
- Enhanced public awareness and education on prevention and early treatment.

Malaria eradication requires a multi-pronged approach, combining vaccines, treatments, genetic interventions, and preventive measures to control and ultimately eliminate the disease.

> Genetically modified malaria-causing parasites do not cause disease; they instead prime the immune system during the initial stage of their life cycle in the liverTwo vaccines against malaria have been rolled out in some countries in Africa. Besides vaccines, scientists have been using genetically altered mosquitoes to stop the spread of malaria. One is the release of radiation-sterilised male mosquitoes to prevent eggs from hatching.
Another is engineering mosquitoes thatslow the growth of malaria-causing parasites in the gut thereby preventing transmission of malaria to humans. The other method is using genetically modified mosquitoes that can spread resistance to malaria-causing parasitesby thriving and mating with wild mosquitoes.
Now, in a radical approach, scientists have shifted their focus from genetic modification of malaria-causing mosquitoes to malaria-causing parasites. They have genetically modified malaria-causing parasites so that the parasites do not cause disease. Instead, they prime the immune system during the initial stage of their life cycle in the liver and before they enter the bloodstream. Malaria-causing parasites cause infection and symptoms begin to show only when they move into the bloodstream from the liver stage.

# The row over tungsten mining near Madurai

The Ministry of Mines recently announced it had granted tungsten mining rights to Hindustan Zinc Limited, a subsidiary of Vedanta Limited, through an auction on November 7. One of the areas chosen was a band in Melur in Madurai district. Following protests, the State government of Tamil Nadu said that it would soon pass a resolution to reject it.

### What does the Ministry say about mining?

The Union government, through a statement on November 7, stated that the Ministry of Mines had successfully concluded the auction of eight critical mineral blocks, launched under Tranche IV of the auction of critical and strategic mineral blocks. It attributed the success of the auction to the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, which leveraged the Union government’s authority to grant mineral concessions for key minerals listed in Part D of the First Schedule. Following the issuance of the Notice Inviting Tender (NIT) on June 24 for 21 mineral blocks, 10 mineral blocks advanced to the second round of e-auction. They contained deposits of strategic minerals such as phosphorite, graphite and vanadium, essential for high-tech and green energy applications.

As the Nayakkarpatti tungsten block is one among eight blocks selected for mining, the Mineral Exploration and Consultancy Ltd. of the Ministry of Mines in its report noted that the 2,015.51 hectares earmarked for tungsten mining was found to be rich in scheelite — an important ore of tungsten. The water source for mining in the area was listed as the Periyar canal.

### Why is there opposition?

The public, environmental activists and politicians have staunchly opposed the move to start tungsten mining in the biodiversity-rich heritage area at Melur. Though the Ministry claimed that it had taken inputs from the Tamil Nadu government, which reportedly showed no opposition before the auction, Chief Minister M.K. Stalin urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to cancel the mining rights awarded to the private firm before announcing that the State government would pass a resolution to cancel mining rights. The earmarked area for mining comprises Melur, Terkutteru, Muthuvelpatti, Kulanipatti, Kidaripatti, Etimagamalam, Arittapatti, Vallalappatti, Sillippyapatti, Chettiyarpatti, and Nayakkarpatti.

Locals and environmental activists fear that mining would destroy its rich flora and fauna in addition to distorting its cultural significance. The major argument raised by opposing voices is the location’s significance as a biodiversity heritage site, declared by the Tamil Nadu government through a notification in November 2022, to protect the site comprising 139.63 hectares in Arittapatti village (Melur block) and 53.8 hectares in Meenakshipuram village (Madurai East taluk) from quarrying and other developmental activities.

Though the Ministry had explained that out of the total area of 20.16 sq.km, only 1.93 sq.km within Arittapatti and Meenakshipuram villages had been notified as a biodiversity heritage site, activists are sceptical about the impact of mining on the environment and cultural sites like temples and Jain beds located around the area.

R.S. Mugilan, an environmental activist known for his protest against projects like Sterlite, Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant, hydrocarbon Project in Neduvasal, and Neutrino project, said, “Vedanta — the company that won the auction for tungsten mining, is known for pollution practices at its copper smelting unit in Thoothukudi.” Highlighting issues from the climate change perspective, Poovulagin Nanbargal, an environmental organisation based in Tamil Nadu, notes that the tailings (the left-over materials from the processing of mined ore) when stored after the mining extraction, would release heavy metals like copper, cadmium, zinc, lead, arsenic, and would be detrimental to humans and the environment.

### Is there a Centre-State rift?

Though the State government says it vehemently opposed the mining of tungsten block in Melur, the Union government alleges: “Since February 2024, when the block was first put to auction till the declaration of result of the auction of November 11, there was no communication from any quarter including the State government regarding any opposition to the auction. Nor did the State government request the Union government to drop the block from auction.” However, the State Minister for Water Resources pointed out that repeated conversations were held with the Union government over mining. He clarified: “When the Union government sought the details of the land, we had pointed out that there was a biodiversity heritage site at the proposed area. Without taking into account such factors, the Union government has awarded the rights to the company.”

     - **Kondapalle District** has notable deposits.
  3. **Karnataka**:
     - Hosts minor deposits in the regions of Chitradurga and Kolar.

---

### **Challenges in Tungsten Mining**
1. **Low Concentration**:
   - Tungsten ores in India have low-grade deposits, making extraction expensive.
2. **Dependence on Imports**:
   - High dependence on imports, primarily from China.
3. **Environmental Concerns**:
   - Mining can lead to habitat destruction and water pollution.

---

### **Conclusion**

Tungsten's unique properties make it indispensable in various high-tech and industrial applications. While **China** dominates global production, India's reliance on imports highlights the need for strategic policies to explore and utilize domestic tungsten reserves. **Rajasthan** remains India's most significant source, with potential for revitalizing mining operations to meet growing demand.

# Why can’t the world agree on a plastic ban?

The **5th Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC-5)** on plastic pollution was a conclave of delegations from about 170 countries mandated to establish a legally binding treaty to end plastic pollution, informally called the Global Plastics Treaty. Despite a week of meetings, the INC-5 failed to meet its mandate.

### What is the Global Plastics Treaty?

The **United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA)** resolved in March 2022 to ‘end plastic pollution, including in the marine environment.’ To that end, INC committees were constituted and tasked with negotiating a treaty before the end of 2024. Over the last two years, countries met five times, and attempted to bridge divergent views on how to end plastic pollution. Several countries are enthusiastic about ways and means to encourage recycling and prohibit certain plastics that lead to littering — India for instance has banned single-use plastic since 2022 — but many of them are reluctant to limit plastic production. Several countries are either petro-states or those that have significant industries that manufacture plastic polymers. Before the latest, and what was expected to be the last round of negotiations, began in Busan, South Korea, the Chair of the INC-5, Luis Vayas Valdivieso, circulated a draft text called a ‘non paper.’ This was roughly a synthesis of the views of all countries on managing plastic production but in the end, it turned out that despite long negotiations, the chasm between countries who viewed addressing plastic pollution as a waste management problem, and those that saw it as unachievable without cutting its production at source, was one that was too wide to bridge.

### How bad is the problem of plastic pollution?

According to a United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) factsheet, plastic waste generation nearly trebled from between 1970 and 1990. In the early 2000s, the amount of plastic waste generated rose more in a single decade than it had in the previous 40 years. Currently, the world produces about 400 million tonnes of plastic waste every year. If historic growth trends continue, global production of primary plastic is forecasted to reach 1,100 million tonnes by 2050. There has also been a worrying shift towards single-use plastic products, items that are meant to be thrown away after a short use.

Approximately, 36% of all plastics produced are used in packaging, including single-use plastic products for food and beverage containers, of which 85% ends up in landfills or as unregulated waste. On top of that, about 98% of single-use plastic products are produced from fossil fuel, or “virgin” feedstock. The level of greenhouse gas emissions associated with the production, use and disposal of conventional fossil fuel-based plastics is forecast to grow to 19% of the global carbon budget by 2040. Of the seven billion tonnes of plastic waste generated globally so far, less than 10% has been recycled. Millions of tonnes of plastic waste are lost to the environment, or sometimes shipped thousands of kilometres to destinations where it is mostly burned or dumped. The estimated annual loss in the value of plastic packaging waste during sorting and processing alone is $80-$120 billion. Cigarette butts — whose filters contain tiny plastic fibres — are the most common type of plastic waste found in the environment. Food wrappers, plastic bottles, plastic bottle caps, plastic grocery bags, plastic straws, and stirrers are the next most common item.

### What is India’s position on the treaty?

India said that it would be “unable” to support any measures to regulate the production of primary plastic polymers as it has larger implications in respect of the right to development of member States. Indian delegation leader, Naresh Pal Gangwar, of the Environment Ministry, said at the concluding plenary session India had always been “committed” to the principle of consensus in decision-making in respect of substantive matters under multilateral environmental agreements. This principle reiterated collective decision-making and reflects shared responsibilities and commitment. Elaborating on these points, India’s position was that it had banned 22 kinds of single-use plastic and put in place an Extended Producer Responsibility regime. This means that companies had to ensure a certain percentage of their plastic-packaging waste was recycled and that the littering of some of the most common kinds of plastic waste was banned. However, virgin polymer production is one of India’s major products and exports, with conglomerates such as Reliance having significant stakes in the industry. India viewed calls to cut plastic production and regulate its supply as akin to introducing barriers to trade. Its position was closer to that of China, Saudi Arabia and several other oil and petrochemical-refining states. At the talks, 85-100 of the gathered countries were supportive of cuts to plastic production, year-wise targets to achieve them and restrict supply and trade. Finally, India has strongly opposed proposals for countries to vote on propositions in draft texts that were produced at negotiations such as INC. In INC-like negotiations — like the Conference of Parties talks in climate — every single word and punctuation has to be agreed upon by all countries. This inevitably leads to deadlock that can take years to resolve. There have been proposals to include voting rights to engineer progress but countries have opposed this, on the ground that it violates the principle of equity.

### Is this the end of the road?

By no means. It is expected that an “INC 5.2” will likely be convened sometime later next year to resume conversation and find common ground to firm a treaty. The final treaty, if agreed to, will lead to the beginning of a periodic Conference of Parties (COP) — just like in the climate talks. The UN talks in Rio de Janerio, in 1992, was where countries decided to address carbon dioxide emissions. It took three years until the first COP was organised in Berlin and in the 29 years since, the world has moved at a glacial pace to address CO2 emissions.

According to an analysis by the Center for International Environmental Law, multilateral environmental agreements have taken varying amounts of time to negotiate treaty text due to a range of factors, ranging from just over a year to nearly five years between the start of negotiations and treaty adoption. In addition, depending on the number of countries required to ratify, it is not unusual for several years to pass between adopting the treaty and its entry into force. For example, the Intergovernmental Conference on an international **legally-binding** instrument under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) for the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction held five sessions over five years. It met seven times by holding a “resumed” fifth session and a “further resumed” fifth session.

> A global plastic ban faces challenges due to economic dependencies, political disagreements, and societal habits. Plastics are integral to industries like packaging and healthcare, making a ban economically disruptive, especially for major plastic-producing nations like Saudi Arabia. Politically, nations differ on whether to limit production or focus on waste management, leading to stalled negotiations in international forums. Despite overwhelming public support for banning single-use plastics, practical issues like consumer dependence and the need for affordable alternatives persist. Environmental and health concerns drive the need for action, but achieving global consensus requires balancing economic interests, policies, and sustainable solutions.
