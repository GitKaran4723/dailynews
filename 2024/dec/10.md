# On reforms in merchant shipping

The Government is preparing to introduce several significant bills aimed at driving much-needed reforms in the shipping industry. Key among them are the Merchant Shipping Bill, 2024 and the Coastal Shipping Bill, 2024, both of which promise to bring transformative changes to boost the sector.

### Why a new bill?

The Merchant Shipping Act, 1958, and the Coasting Vessels Act, 1838, which the new bills aim to repeal, have become outdated and fail to address the contemporary needs of the merchant marine sector. Significant regulatory gaps exist, particularly for vessels operating in the offshore sector which comprise nearly 50% of Indian-flagged vessels. Furthermore, maritime training was liberalised allowing private sector participation, yet there is no legal framework in the existing Act to regulate their activities effectively.

The Merchant Shipping Act, 1958, also restricts seafarers’ welfare provisions to Indian-flagged ships, despite 85% of the 2,80,000 active Indian seafarers working on foreign-flagged vessels. Additionally, the Act lacks enabling provisions for implementing certain international conventions that India has signed or plans to ratify. Crucially, the outdated, license-era provisions of the Act have become a roadblock to modernising maritime administration, which needs to transition from being a mere regulator to a regulator-cum-facilitator, thereby promoting the ‘ease of doing business.’

### What are the features of the Merchant Shipping Bill?

The Merchant Shipping Bill introduces significant changes to modernise India’s maritime framework, drawing upon the best practices of leading maritime jurisdictions like the U.K., Norway, and Singapore. Some of the key reform measures include:

i) Ease of registration: the existing law restricts vessel registration to entities with 100% Indian ownership. The new Bill proposes significant reforms to attract foreign investment. It also reduces the ownership threshold for Indian citizens/entities from 100% to 51%, enabling more flexibility. It allows Limited Liability Partnerships (LLPs), Non-Resident Indians (NRIs), and Overseas Citizens of India (OCIs) to own and register Indian vessels. This is in line with the law of the U.S. where Green card holders are permitted to own American flagships or Singapore law where permanent residents can own ships of their flags. It also permits foreign entities to hold shares in Indian vessels while ensuring majority ownership remains with Indian entities, NRIs, or OCIs.

Additionally, the Bill allows the registration of vessels chartered by Indian entities under the bareboat charter-cum-demise, enabling entrepreneurs to acquire ownership of vessels at the end of the charter period. This provision, particularly beneficial for capital-deficient entrepreneurs, facilitates entry into the shipping industry without upfront investment.

India is the second largest ship recycling centre after Bangladesh, and the ship recycling industry practises the concept of cash purchase of the vessel before it is brought for demolition. Often it becomes difficult for cash buyers to register the vessels for their final voyage, as they no more remain ‘seaworthy’. To address challenges faced by the ship recycling industry, the Bill introduces provisions for temporary registration of vessels destined for demolition. This measure is expected to bolster activities at India’s ship recycling hubs like Alang.

ii) Enlarging the scope of vessels: the existing Act regulates only mechanised ships (engine-fitted vessels) above a certain size, leaving smaller mechanised vessels and all non-mechanised vessels outside its ambit. This regulatory gap has allowed many vessels to operate without adequate oversight. India’s offshore drilling sector gained prominence in 1974 when Sagar Samrat, a merchant vessel designed for exploratory offshore drilling, drilled the first well in Bombay High. Since then, the offshore sector has employed a diverse range of mechanised and non-mechanised vessels, such as accommodation barges, work barges, submersibles, and drones. However, these vessels remain either unregulated or inadequately regulated under the current framework, exposing the sector to operational and safety risks.

The new Bill seeks to address this issue by expanding the definition of ‘vessels’ to uniformly include a wide range of crafts, including submersibles, semi-submersibles, hydrofoils, non-displacement crafts, amphibious crafts, wing-in-ground crafts, pleasure crafts, barges, lighters, Mobile Offshore Drilling Units (MODUs), and Mobile Offshore Units (MOUs), whether mechanised or not. This definition is expected to enhance transparency and ensure comprehensive regulatory oversight in the offshore sector.

Furthermore, the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, which exploited gaps in maritime security, underscored the urgent need for stricter regulation of all categories of vessels. By empowering authorities to issue instructions to all types of vessels, the new Bill aims to strengthen coastal security, making India’s coastline safer and more secure.

### What about marine pollution?

The Government has recently undertaken several initiatives to minimise pollution from shipping activities. Some of the measures include reducing the sulphur content in marine fuel from 3.5% to less than 0.5%, banning the use of single-use plastics on Indian ships, and launching the online portal ‘Swachh Sagar’ to facilitate the proper disposal of ship-generated waste at Indian ports.

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has adopted several conventions aimed at preventing and combating marine pollution, such as the Civil Liability Convention (CLC), the Convention on Limitation of Liability on Maritime Claims (LLMC), the Bunker Convention, the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL), and the Wreck Removal Convention. The existing law, however, has either omitted or partially implemented these conventions. The new Bill fully incorporates these international conventions, aligning India’s maritime regulatory framework with global standards. This comprehensive approach reinforces India’s commitment to combating marine pollution and safeguarding the maritime environment for sustainable shipping practices.

### What are provisions for seafarers’?

The remarkable growth in the number of Indian seafarers employed on foreign-flagged ships over the last 7-8 years stands out as one of the biggest success stories in Indian merchant shipping. The workforce has grown from 1,16,000 in 2015-16 to 2,85,000 today, with nearly 85% of these seafarers serving on foreign-flagged vessels.

However, the existing Act lacks provisions for the welfare and safety of this vast workforce working on foreign-flagged vesels. The proposed Bill addresses this gap by extending the scope of welfare measures initiated by the Union government to include Indian seafarers working on foreign-flagged ships as well. Furthermore, it seeks to extend the protections and benefits outlined in the Maritime Labour Convention (MLC) to all Indian seafarers, ensuring better working conditions, safety standards, and support systems for those contributing to the global maritime industry.

### What about maritime training?

Under Entry 25 of List 1 (Union List) of the Constitution, the Union Government is responsible for the education and training of the mercantile marine and the regulation of such education and training provided by States and other agencies. In the past, maritime training was primarily conducted by government-run institutions directly under the administrative control of the maritime regulator, the Director General of Shipping. Consequently, there was no need for a specific legal framework to regulate these institutions.

However, following economic liberalisation, maritime training was opened to the private sector. Today, over 160 maritime training institutes operate across the country, yet their activities are governed solely by rules, government orders, and notifications rather than an enabling legal framework. This regulatory gap has allowed unauthorised institutes to operate without obtaining proper approvals, making it challenging for the maritime administration to take action against offenders.

The proposed Bill seeks to address this significant anomaly by introducing clear legal provisions for regulating maritime training in line with the constitutional mandate. This step is expected to eliminate illegal maritime training institutes and associated fraudulent practices, which often exploit unsuspecting rural youth, while ensuring the delivery of high-quality, standardised maritime education nationwide.

### Is there a focus on coastal shipping?

The Government has taken a significant step by distinguishing between the technical regulation of ships and the commercial utilisation of Indian coastal waters, removing provisions related to the latter from the Merchant Shipping Act. These aspects, including licensing, permissions for operations along the Indian coast and Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), creation of a coastal plan involving the Union and States, and the integration of inland and coastal shipping, have been incorporated into the proposed Coastal Shipping Bill, 2024. This focused approach aims to foster growth and development of the Indian coastal sector.

The move aligns with the Government’s flagship ‘Sagarmala’ program, which emphasises the promotion of coastal shipping through initiatives like dedicated berths for coastal vessels and enhanced hinterland connectivity for coastal cargo movement. Infrastructure development and a robust regulatory framework must progress simultaneously, making the introduction of the Coastal Shipping Bill both timely and essential.

Maritime development, like any developmental initiative, should remain bipartisan and above party politics. By fostering investment, enhancing safety, combating marine pollution, and supporting seafarers’ welfare, the proposed reforms promise to unlock the true potential of India’s maritime sector.

> Reforms in **merchant shipping** aim to modernize India’s maritime sector, ensuring compliance with global standards while boosting economic efficiency. Key reforms include streamlining regulations, enhancing safety protocols, and adopting digital processes for faster clearances. Emphasis on green shipping, with reduced carbon emissions, aligns with international sustainability goals. Measures to attract investments, incentivize shipbuilding, and upgrade ports strengthen India's role in global trade. Addressing issues like crew welfare, skill development, and boosting the merchant navy workforce ensures competitiveness. These reforms position India as a hub for maritime activities, contributing to economic growth and supporting the vision of **Atmanirbhar Bharat**.

# Indians need the right to disconnect

Soon after death of an EY employee in September, allegedly due to work pressure, MP Shashi Tharoor had said that he would raise the issue in Parliament. He said that “inhumanity at the workplace must be legislated out of existence.” A recent report by The Hindu reveals that Indian women in professional jobs, such as auditing, Information Technology, and media, work more than 55 hours a week. The working hours vary for those who belong to the marginalised sections of society and work in the unorganised sector. According to a study by ADP Research Institute, 49% of Indian workers said workplace stress negatively impacts their mental health. As French politician Benoit Hamon said, “Employees physically leave the office, but they do not leave their work. They remain attached by a kind of electronic leash like a dog. The text, the messages, the emails colonise the life of the individual to the point where he or she eventually breaks down”.

### Right to disconnect laws

Such tragic incidents, research, and statements highlight how the right to disconnect is an important right. It allows employees to disconnect from their employer outside of working hours. The Labour Chamber of the French Supreme Court ruled in 2001 that an employee is under no obligation to work from home or take home files and working tools. This decision was subsequently confirmed by the Cour de Cassation (the highest court in the French judiciary), which said, “The fact that [the employee] was not reachable on his cell phone outside working hours cannot be considered as a misconduct”. Portugal has a Right to Disconnect law, which makes it illegal for employers to contact employees outside working hours, except in emergencies. Similarly, according to Article 88 of the Organic Law 3/2018 on the Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of Digital Rights in Spain, “Public workers and employees shall have the right to switch off devices in order to guarantee that, outside of legal or conventionally established working hours, their time off, leave and holidays are respected, in addition to their personal and family privacy, with the aim of promoting a good work-life balance”. This year, the Australian Parliament passed the Fair Work Legislation Amendment, which gave employees the right to disconnect from work outside of working hours. Ireland has also recognised the right to disconnect for employees.

### Where does India stand?

India does not have specific laws recognising the right to disconnect from work. However, the Constitution, the Directive Principles of State Policy, and various judicial pronouncements have spoken of the right to work in a conducive and healthy environment. Article 38 of the Constitution mandates that “the State shall strive to promote the welfare of the people”. Article 39(e) of the Directive Principles of State Policy directs the state to direct its policy towards securing the strength and health of its workers. The Supreme Court, in Vishakha v State of Rajasthan (1997), ruled that sexual harassment at the workplace violates fundamental rights, recognised the right to dignity at the workplace, and issued guidelines to ensure that there is a safe working environment for women and gender equality. In Ravindra Kumar Dhariwal and Ors v. Union of India (2021), the Court read Article 14 to include ideas of inclusive equality to reasonably accommodate persons with disabilities. Justice D.Y. Chandrachud said that an employer must consider an employee’s individual differences and capabilities. In Praveen Pradhan v. State of Uttaranchal (2012), the High Court of Uttarakhand held that “under the pretext of administrative control and discipline, a superior officer cannot be left to enjoy extreme liberty to make the intense humiliation and scolding inhumanly in front of all the subordinate staff members for a little lapse.” Despite the clear recognition of the right to dignity at the workplace and a direction for employers to be sensitive towards mental health concerns, and also laws that fix accountability in the case of breaching working hours, violating dignity is unfortunately common in Indian workplaces.

### Prolonged working hours

In 2018, MP Supriya Sule introduced a Private Member Bill in the Lok Sabha, which delineated the right to disconnect from work after working hours. The bill included the provision of a penalty of 1% of the total renumeration of all employees to be paid by companies for noncompliance with its provisions.

However, in recent years, there has been no significant legislative effort to recognise employees’ right to disconnect from work outside working hours or to impose a duty on employers to be mindful of employee well-being and avoid overworking them. Research by Harvard Business Review shows that working prolonged hours causes stress, coronary heart diseases, and impacts overall health. Contrary to the widespread belief that overworked human beings bring in productivity, research by the University of Oxford in collaboration with British multinational telecoms firm BT found a conclusive link between happiness and productivity. Therefore, employers need to take into account psychological factors while dealing with employees. In its march towards becoming the third largest economy by 2030, India must recognise that the right to disconnect will increase productivity and ensure the growth and well-being of both employees and employers.

> The growing digitalization of work has blurred boundaries between personal and professional life, making the **right to disconnect** essential for Indians. Constant connectivity through emails, messages, and work-related calls outside office hours leads to burnout, stress, and a poor work-life balance. Countries like France have implemented laws allowing employees to disconnect after work hours, setting a global precedent. In India, where workplace pressures are high, formalizing this right can improve mental health, productivity, and overall well-being. Employers must adopt policies respecting boundaries, ensuring employees can unwind without fear of repercussions, fostering healthier work environments and long-term economic benefits.

# In energy-dependent world, the issue of food security

“Addressing food insecurity and energy poverty is central to achieving global stability, but tackling these issues independently is no longer sufficient,” warns the World Bank in its latest report on climate and development. The intertwined crises of food and energy security are defining the trajectory of the 21st century, casting a long shadow over global stability. Both systems are under siege — food production is strained by climate change, population growth, and inequality, while energy systems face geopolitical tensions, outdated infrastructure, and the slow transition from fossil fuels. Yet, their interconnectedness presents an even greater challenge: agriculture, a lifeline for humanity, is both a significant energy consumer and a contributor to climate change. As the world teeters on the edge of multiple tipping points, can we truly address one without confronting the other?

### Dependency on carbon-intensive energy

Agriculture consumes nearly 70% of global freshwater resources and is responsible for over 20% of greenhouse gas emissions. Its dependence on fossil fuels — for mechanisation, irrigation, fertilizer production, and transportation —has created a vicious cycle of environmental degradation. This reliance also exposes food systems to energy price shocks, threatening global stability. Rising temperatures and erratic weather patterns further disrupt agricultural output, putting the livelihoods of 2.5 billion people at risk. Between 2020 and 2023, nearly 11.8% of the global population faced severe food insecurity, a figure projected to rise to 956 million by 2028.

Renewable energy investments reached $500 billion in 2022, but fossil fuel consumption remains robust due to short-term economic and geopolitical pressures. Nations such as the United States, Brazil, and Guyana continue to expand oil and gas production, prioritising exports and domestic energy security. This ongoing dependency on carbon-intensive energy exacerbates the vulnerability of global food systems, particularly in regions with limited access to reliable energy. Energy poverty reveals sharp global inequities. Low-income countries account for a small fraction of global energy demand but suffer disproportionately from supply disruptions. Extreme weather events frequently damage energy infrastructure in regions where power grids are already unreliable. In rural areas, energy deficits hinder agricultural productivity, leading to higher food prices and deepening poverty. In sub-Saharan Africa, per-hectare fertilizer usage remains far below the global average, contributing to food insecurity despite $1.9 billion spent on fertilizer imports by the top 10 African importing countries in 2021 — more than double the amount in 2016.

Agriculture’s reliance on fossil fuels further highlights its vulnerability. Natural gas, critical for fertilizer production, is both a feedstock and an energy source, with 80% of it used for ammonia synthesis and 20% powering the process. Volatility in natural gas prices directly impacts fertilizer costs and global food prices. Geopolitical actions, such as China’s 2021 ban on phosphate fertilizer exports, disrupt agricultural supply chains. India, which imports 60% of its diammonium phosphate (DAP) fertilizers, experienced significant delays during critical cropping seasons, exposing its vulnerability to external shocks.

Renewable energy offers a glimmer of hope, but its deployment remains uneven. High-income countries installed 83% of new renewable capacity in 2022, leaving low-income nations reliant on outdated, carbon-intensive systems. While solar-powered irrigation and biomass energy solutions could transform agriculture, high costs and inadequate infrastructure limit their reach. The transition risks bypassing those who need it most.

### Demands on agriculture

Meanwhile, agriculture is being increasingly burdened with competing demands. Beyond feeding a growing population, it is expected to support the global energy transition by producing biofuels. This dual role often pits food security against energy needs, as biofuel production requires vast land and water resources. In a world where nearly 12% of the population faces hunger, is prioritising energy over food morally defensible? The financial costs of addressing food and energy insecurity are substantial yet achievable. The World Food Security Outlook estimates that ensuring basic caloric needs for the world’s most vulnerable populations will require $90 billion annually until 2030. Tackling malnutrition among women and children demands an additional $11 billion per year, while transforming global food systems could cost $300 billion–$400 billion annually — just 0.5% of global GDP. However, for low-income nations, these costs are staggering, with food insecurity expenses in some cases surpassing 95% of GDP.

The implications of inaction are dire. Food insecurity is projected to cost the global economy trillions in lost productivity and adverse health outcomes. Climate-induced energy disruptions threaten to destabilise entire regions, driving social unrest and mass migration. For example, Africa’s mineral wealth, essential for renewable technologies, is often extracted without benefiting local economies, perpetuating cycles of poverty and underdevelopment.

### Need for inclusivity

Despite record investments in renewables, fossil fuel expansions continue unabated. Every delay compounds the human, environmental, and economic costs, narrowing opportunities for a resilient future. Clean energy solutions must address structural barriers to inclusivity, ensuring that the most vulnerable communities are not left behind.

Ultimately, the twin crises of food and energy insecurity challenge global priorities. The solutions are within reach, but they require a fundamental shift in perspective. Agriculture must be reimagined as both a source of sustenance and a cornerstone of sustainable development. Failure to act will create the risk of pushing millions into hunger and undermining global climate goals. As the clock ticks, the question remains: will the world rise to meet the moment?

> In an energy-dependent world, food security is intricately linked to energy availability and affordability. Modern agriculture relies heavily on energy for irrigation, mechanization, transportation, and the production of fertilizers and pesticides. Rising energy costs or supply disruptions can escalate food production expenses, impacting affordability and accessibility, especially in vulnerable regions. Additionally, competition between biofuel production and food crops exacerbates resource scarcity. Climate change, driven by energy-related emissions, further threatens crop yields. Ensuring food security requires a sustainable energy transition, investment in renewable energy for agriculture, and innovative practices like precision farming to reduce energy dependency while securing global food systems.
