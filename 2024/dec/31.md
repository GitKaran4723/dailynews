# Private Members’ Bills get short shrift in both Houses of Parliament

### **Private Members’ Bill in India: An In-Depth Analysis**

#### **Introduction**

In a parliamentary democracy like India, the legislative process allows both government ministers and individual Members of Parliament (MPs) to introduce bills. These are categorized as **Government Bills** and **Private Members’ Bills (PMBs)**. While Government Bills reflect the ruling party's legislative agenda, Private Members’ Bills allow non-ministerial MPs to propose new laws or amendments, giving them a platform to influence policymaking and represent public concerns.

---

### **Private Members’ Bill: Definition and Features**

- A **Private Member** refers to any MP who is not a part of the Council of Ministers.  
- A **Private Members’ Bill** is a legislative proposal introduced by such MPs in either the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha.  
- It enables MPs to raise issues of national interest, propose reforms, or introduce new laws that may not be prioritized by the government.  

**Key Features:**  
1. **Introduction Timing:** PMBs are only introduced and discussed on **Fridays** in both Houses of Parliament.  
2. **Notice Period:** MPs must give at least **one month’s notice** before introducing the bill.  
3. **Limited Discussion Time:** Due to limited time allocation, many PMBs do not reach the discussion stage.  
4. **Non-Binding on Government:** Even if passed in one House, the government is not obligated to take action on a Private Members’ Bill.  

---

### **Purpose and Importance of Private Members’ Bills**

1. **Democratic Participation:** Enables MPs from opposition parties and backbenchers to contribute to the legislative process.  
2. **Public Policy Influence:** Raises awareness about neglected or emerging social, economic, and legal issues.  
3. **Government Accountability:** Encourages the ruling government to consider reforms it may otherwise overlook.  
4. **Legislative Innovation:** Allows experimentation with policy ideas that may later be adopted by the government.  

---

### **Historical Significance of Private Members’ Bills in India**

- Since **1952**, **14 Private Members’ Bills** have been enacted into law.  
- Notable examples include:  
  - **The Hindu Marriage (Amendment) Bill, 1956** – introduced reforms in Hindu marriage laws.  
  - **The Proceedings of Legislature (Protection of Publication) Bill, 1956** – provided protection for the publication of legislative proceedings.  
  - **The Supreme Court (Enlargement of Criminal Appellate Jurisdiction) Bill, 1968** – expanded the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction.  

Despite these successes, most PMBs are rarely passed due to limited time and lack of government support.

---

### **Challenges Faced by Private Members’ Bills**

1. **Limited Discussion Time:** Very little parliamentary time is allotted for their discussion, often leading to their neglect.  
2. **Government’s Dominance:** Government Bills take precedence, and the ruling party often controls the legislative agenda.  
3. **Lack of Political Consensus:** PMBs rarely receive cross-party support, making their passage difficult.  
4. **Procedural Hurdles:** Complex procedures and limited support from government machinery make it challenging to draft and present PMBs effectively.

### **Difference Between Private Members’ Bill and Government Bill**

| **Aspect**               | **Private Members’ Bill (PMB)**                        | **Government Bill**                               |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Introduced By**       | Any MP not part of the Council of Ministers           | Minister on behalf of the government             |
| **Objective**           | Highlights public issues or suggests new policies     | Implements government policies or reforms        |
| **Notice Period**       | 1 month in advance                                   | 7 days in most cases                              |
| **Introduction Day**    | Only on Fridays                                      | Any working day of the Parliament                |
| **Priority in Discussion** | Lower priority; discussed only if time permits      | Higher priority in legislative business          |
| **Government Support**  | Usually lacks government backing                      | Fully supported by the ruling government         |
| **Passage Probability** | Rarely passed due to limited support                  | Higher probability of passage                    |
| **Binding Nature**      | Non-binding even if passed in one House              | Becomes law once passed by both Houses and assented by the President |

---

### **Way Forward for Private Members’ Bills**

1. **Increased Parliamentary Time:** Allocate more time for the discussion of PMBs to encourage legislative diversity.  
2. **Cross-Party Collaboration:** Encourage bipartisan support for meaningful bills regardless of the political affiliation of the proposer.  
3. **Public Engagement:** Raise public awareness about significant PMBs to build pressure for their passage.  
4. **Expert Assistance:** Provide MPs with expert legal and policy drafting support to improve the quality of PMBs.  
5. **Government Receptiveness:** The government should consider adopting and integrating relevant proposals from PMBs into its own legislation.

---

### **Conclusion**

Private Members’ Bills, though often sidelined, are a vital component of India’s legislative process. They empower MPs to raise critical issues and suggest legal reforms, enhancing democratic participation and policymaking. However, limited parliamentary time, procedural challenges, and lack of government support hinder their effectiveness. Strengthening the role of PMBs through increased discussion time, expert support, and cross-party collaboration can make the legislative process more inclusive and responsive.

> Private Members’ Bills (PMBs) in India are legislative proposals introduced by MPs who are not part of the Council of Ministers, allowing them to raise public issues and suggest legal reforms. Introduced only on Fridays with a one-month notice, PMBs receive limited discussion time and rarely pass due to government dominance and lack of support. In contrast, Government Bills, introduced by ministers, have higher priority and stronger chances of becoming law. Strengthening PMBs through increased parliamentary time, bipartisan support, public engagement, and expert assistance can enhance democratic participation and lead to more inclusive policymaking in India.

# States and the danger of poorly manufactured drugs

### **Analysis of the Issue of Non-Standard Quality (NSQ) Drugs in India**

The recent tragedy in Ballari district, Karnataka, where five young mothers reportedly died due to contaminated drugs manufactured by a pharmaceutical company in West Bengal, has brought India’s drug regulatory framework under scrutiny. This incident highlights the significant gaps in monitoring and controlling the quality of pharmaceutical products across the country. The problem of Non-Standard Quality (NSQ) drugs is not new but has become more alarming with the increasing number of similar incidents in recent years.

---

### **Regulatory Framework and Its Limitations**

India’s pharmaceutical sector is governed by the **Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940**, and the **Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945**, which regulate the import, manufacture, distribution, and sale of drugs. However, the Act's structure creates certain regulatory inefficiencies:

1. **State-Level Licensing and Inspection:**  
   - Pharmaceutical companies are licensed and inspected solely by the drug inspectors in the state where their manufacturing units are located.  
   - Once licensed, these companies can market and sell their products across all Indian states without further scrutiny.

2. **Lack of Inter-State Oversight:**  
   - States like Karnataka cannot regulate or restrict the sale of drugs produced in other states, even if those drugs are found to be substandard.  
   - There is no centralized mechanism to monitor and enforce uniform drug quality standards nationwide.

3. **Fragmented Regulatory Authority:**  
   - While the **Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO)** oversees licensing for larger manufacturers and critical drugs, state drug controllers handle licensing for most drugs.  
   - This fragmented control leads to inconsistent enforcement of quality standards across states.

---

### **Data Supporting the Crisis**

Evidence from Karnataka's drug testing data over the past three years reveals a concerning trend. Of the 894 drug samples randomly tested, **601 failed quality checks**, and these were predominantly from manufacturers located in states outside Karnataka. This data highlights:

- **Widespread Quality Issues:** A substantial portion of drugs circulating in Karnataka’s market are substandard, primarily from out-of-state manufacturers.  
- **Regulatory Loopholes:** State authorities lack the power to act against these manufacturers, making it difficult to prevent the distribution of unsafe drugs.  
- **Risk to Public Health:** The prevalence of NSQ drugs poses a severe threat to patient safety, eroding public trust in healthcare systems.

---

### **Root Causes of the Problem**

1. **Inadequate Inspection Mechanisms:**  
   - Many state drug control departments lack sufficient manpower and resources for regular inspections of manufacturing units.  
   - Inspections are often irregular and may be influenced by political or business interests.

2. **Poor Coordination Between States:**  
   - States operate in silos without adequate mechanisms for sharing information on drug quality and enforcement actions.  

3. **Limited Central Oversight:**  
   - The CDSCO is understaffed relative to the vast pharmaceutical industry it is supposed to regulate.  
   - Central regulations focus primarily on approvals rather than on consistent quality checks throughout the product lifecycle.

4. **Proliferation of Small-Scale Manufacturers:**  
   - India has a large number of small and medium-scale drug manufacturers, many of whom lack the infrastructure to maintain high production standards.

---

### **Impact on Public Health and Economy**

1. **Loss of Lives and Health Risks:**  
   - Contaminated or substandard drugs can cause serious health complications, as seen in the Ballari incident, leading to fatalities and severe illnesses.

2. **Erosion of Public Trust:**  
   - Recurring incidents of drug contamination erode public confidence in the healthcare system and regulatory authorities.

3. **Economic Implications:**  
   - NSQ drugs can lead to higher healthcare costs due to treatment failures and prolonged illness.  
   - International markets may lose confidence in Indian pharmaceutical exports, affecting the economy.

---

### **Way Forward**

1. **Centralized Drug Quality Monitoring:**  
   - Establish a centralized national database for drug quality reports accessible by all states to facilitate information sharing and coordinated action.  
   - Implement a nationwide track-and-trace system for pharmaceutical products.

2. **Strengthening Regulatory Framework:**  
   - Amend the **Drugs and Cosmetics Act** to empower state authorities to act against substandard drugs from other states.  
   - Introduce stricter penalties for manufacturers producing substandard drugs.

3. **Regular and Rigorous Inspections:**  
   - Increase funding and staffing for drug control authorities to conduct more frequent and unannounced inspections.  
   - Implement third-party audits for manufacturing units to ensure impartial quality checks.

4. **Leveraging Technology:**  
   - Use digital tools like blockchain for supply chain transparency to trace drug origins and prevent counterfeit products.  
   - Develop mobile apps for consumers to verify drug authenticity.

5. **Public Awareness and Reporting:**  
   - Launch public awareness campaigns to educate consumers about reporting adverse drug reactions and suspected counterfeit drugs.  
   - Establish toll-free helplines and online portals for complaints.

6. **Inter-State Coordination:**  
   - Create an inter-state regulatory council to oversee drug quality across India, ensuring uniform standards.  
   - Encourage collaboration between state drug controllers for joint inspections and enforcement.

---

### **Conclusion**

The tragic deaths in Ballari due to contaminated drugs expose deep flaws in India’s drug regulatory system. The current framework allows pharmaceutical companies to bypass uniform quality checks, putting millions at risk. Strengthening the regulatory structure through centralized monitoring, rigorous inspections, inter-state coordination, and leveraging technology is critical. It is imperative that India reforms its pharmaceutical regulatory mechanisms to safeguard public health, restore trust in healthcare, and maintain its global reputation as the "pharmacy of the world."

> The recent deaths in Ballari, Karnataka, due to contaminated drugs highlight critical flaws in India’s drug regulatory system. Under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, pharmaceutical companies are regulated only by their home state, limiting other states' ability to prevent the distribution of substandard drugs. Data shows a majority of failed drug samples in Karnataka originated from other states. Inadequate inspections, poor inter-state coordination, and weak central oversight contribute to this issue. Strengthening regulations, enhancing inspections, improving inter-state collaboration, leveraging technology, and raising public awareness are essential to ensure drug safety and protect public health.

# UPI duopoly’s rise and market vulnerabilities

The rise of **Unified Payments Interface (UPI)** in the eight years since its launch has been meteoric, with the UPI ecosystem now accounting for nearly **eight in every 10 digital transactions** in India, with a value of over **₹20.60 lakh crore** in August of this year alone.

This success, however, is no small feat for a country like India, which is characterised by low digital literacy and a historic reliance on cash, and is deeply reflective of the critical role UPI has played in fostering public trust in digital payments.

UPI’s continued success will heavily depend on whether its ecosystem can maintain and build upon such public trust, which will, in turn, depend on the ecosystem’s performance on metrics such as resilience, reliability, and openness to innovation. This is particularly important as UPI’s penetration remains at 30% of the population, which is impressive for a new payments technology, but shows how much of India remains to be brought into the digital payments fold. Achieving this will require substantially new innovations in everything from service offerings to app design and the overall product base of the UPI ecosystem to make it relevant for the remaining 70% of the country.

A major hindrance is the extreme market concentration of two Third Party App Providers (TPAPs) in the UPI network — **Phone Pe and Google Pay**. Together, they **control over 85% of the total market share, whereas the next biggest player, Paytm, controls merely 7.2%**.

### Major risks

The emergence of a duopoly, especially a foreign-owned one, at a relatively early stage in the UPI ecosystem creates three major risks. The first is the increased systemic vulnerability. High market concentration in the payments space can lead to single points of failure, where any sudden stoppage or break in services can have ripple effects across the entire financial structure. Given that nearly eight out of 10 transactions carried out via UPI in a month take place on either PhonePe or GooglePay, these two apps have effectively become such single points of failure. For a system as critical as UPI to remain robust, it is essential to develop failsafes and backup mechanisms to ensure the system continues to function smoothly.

**Second**, there is the risk of decreased competition and innovation in the payments and financial ecosystem. By consolidating a disproportionately large share of the market and user base, the two dominant TPAPs benefit from a scale that creates high barriers to entry for smaller and newer market participants. Given that all service providers in the UPI network are subject to a zero-charge framework for users, they primarily compete to achieve user scale, which they then leverage for commercial purposes by cross-selling other financial products.

The widespread scale of operations and user base that the two foreign-owned TPAPs have consolidated creates an inherently uncompetitive market. The lack of competition also disincentivises investment in new innovations, as the existing dominant players need not do anything more to maintain their current positions.

**Third** is the risk of foreign dominance. Both TPAPs in the duopoly are foreign-owned — PhonePe by Walmart and GPay by Google. No Indian TPAP or service provider can realistically hope to compete against the dominant TPAPs without billions of dollars in funding. Further, this foreign ownership creates multiple potentially new lines of failure, including data protection and backdoor access to sensitive information of Indian citizens, many of which Indian regulators might not even be aware of. It is therefore prudent policy to encourage the development of Indian TPAPs, which can strengthen the UPI ecosystem by providing a counterbalance to the current dominant platforms. This is not an argument against having foreign-owned UPI players or service providers, but rather a call to create a more level playing field for Indian apps and developers.

While the existing duopoly has been repeatedly flagged for its associated risks by regulators and parliamentarians alike, it remains to be substantially addressed. In 2020, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) issued a circular instructing all TPAPs to cap their market share at 30% of the total volume of transactions processed via UPI during the previous quarter and imposed an upper limit of two years for implementation. However, the NPCI subsequently extended this deadline. Four years later, the two TPAPs in question are no worse for the wear, with PhonePe alone accounting for 48.36% and Google Pay for 37.3% of market share in volume, as of August 2024. It is now being reported that such delays could continue beyond this year.

To further add to the troubles of Indian developers, recent reports suggest that the NPCI may potentially increase the market share cap from 30% to 40%. However, every subsequent extension given by the NPCI, with any potential increase in the market share cap, will only allow the dominant TPAPs to consolidate their hold.

Under the right conditions and with the right incentives, however, the UPI ecosystem has every potential to offer smaller market participants a level playing field where they can innovate and compete with larger established players. As UPI enters its next phase of growth in both reach and innovation, the implementation of a market cap is a key step in insulating the ecosystem from such risks that stand to substantially erode public trust and derail UPI’s success and future transformational capabilities.

### **UPI Duopoly’s Rise and Market Vulnerabilities**

The Unified Payments Interface (UPI), introduced by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) in 2016, has revolutionized India’s digital payment landscape, enabling seamless, real-time money transfers. However, the dominance of two major players—**PhonePe** and **Google Pay**—has led to a duopoly, raising concerns over market vulnerabilities and systemic risks.

---

### **Rise of the UPI Duopoly**

1. **Market Share Concentration:**  
   - **PhonePe** and **Google Pay** collectively control over **80%** of the UPI market.  
   - Other players like **Paytm**, **Amazon Pay**, and various fintech startups hold significantly smaller shares.

2. **Factors Behind the Dominance:**  
   - **User-Friendly Interfaces:** Intuitive design, ease of use, and quick onboarding have attracted millions of users.  
   - **Deep Market Penetration:** Aggressive marketing strategies, cashback offers, and partnerships with merchants.  
   - **Early-Mover Advantage:** Early entry into the UPI ecosystem allowed them to capture a significant user base.  
   - **Big Tech Backing:** Google’s global presence and PhonePe’s association with Flipkart (and Walmart) ensured strong financial support and trust.

3. **Infrastructure and Network Effects:**  
   - Wide merchant acceptance and network effects have further entrenched their dominance.  
   - Integration with various apps and e-commerce platforms expanded their utility.

---

### **Market Vulnerabilities Due to UPI Duopoly**

1. **Systemic Risk:**  
   - Heavy reliance on two players increases the risk of systemic disruption if either faces technical failures, cybersecurity breaches, or regulatory challenges.  
   - A technical outage in one dominant app could paralyze a significant portion of digital transactions in India.

2. **Data Privacy and Security Concerns:**  
   - The concentration of financial data with a few players raises concerns over data privacy, misuse, and potential breaches.  
   - Big tech companies handling sensitive user data may be exposed to global cybersecurity risks.

3. **Reduced Competition and Innovation:**  
   - Smaller players and startups struggle to compete, stifling innovation and diversity in financial products.  
   - Lack of competition may lead to complacency in improving services and security.

4. **Market Manipulation and Anti-Competitive Practices:**  
   - Dominant players might engage in practices that marginalize competitors, such as predatory pricing or exclusive partnerships.  
   - Potential for monopolistic behavior, limiting consumer choice and increasing costs in the future.

5. **Regulatory Challenges:**  
   - Regulating a market concentrated among two players becomes complex, especially when global firms are involved.  
   - Cross-border data flow and compliance with domestic laws pose regulatory hurdles.

---

### **Regulatory Response and Mitigation Measures**

1. **NPCI’s Market Cap Rule:**  
   - NPCI introduced a rule in 2020, limiting any single third-party app provider (TPAP) to **30%** of UPI transaction volumes to prevent market concentration.  
   - However, full implementation has been delayed, allowing PhonePe and Google Pay to maintain their dominance.

2. **Promotion of Alternative Platforms:**  
   - The government and NPCI are encouraging the adoption of alternatives like **BHIM UPI**, **WhatsApp Pay**, and **RuPay Credit on UPI** to diversify the market.  
   - **Digital Payment Incentive Schemes** support smaller players and startups in gaining market share.

3. **Data Localization and Privacy Laws:**  
   - The **Data Protection Bill** mandates data localization, ensuring that sensitive financial data remains within India.  
   - Stricter data privacy regulations aim to safeguard user data from misuse.

4. **Support for Fintech Startups:**  
   - Incentives for fintech innovation and public-private partnerships can level the playing field.  
   - Encouraging niche players to develop customized payment solutions for underserved markets.

---

### **Way Forward**

1. **Effective Implementation of Market Cap Rules:**  
   - Strict enforcement of NPCI's market share cap to prevent over-dependence on a few players.  
   - Regular audits to ensure compliance with market concentration norms.

2. **Strengthening Cybersecurity:**  
   - Robust cybersecurity frameworks to mitigate systemic risks associated with concentrated digital payment systems.  
   - Regular stress-testing and security audits for major UPI apps.

3. **Encouraging Public Sector Participation:**  
   - Strengthening public-sector alternatives like **BHIM UPI** to offer reliable, government-backed payment solutions.  
   - Collaboration between public and private sectors to enhance inclusivity.

4. **Fostering Competitive Innovation:**  
   - Reducing entry barriers for fintech startups through regulatory sandboxes and financial incentives.  
   - Promoting interoperability and open banking to encourage innovation.

5. **Consumer Awareness and Protection:**  
   - Educating users about diverse UPI options to reduce dependence on dominant players.  
   - Strengthening consumer protection frameworks against data misuse and service disruptions.

---

### **Conclusion**

The rise of a duopoly in India’s UPI ecosystem, dominated by PhonePe and Google Pay, presents both advantages and risks. While these platforms have accelerated digital payment adoption, their overwhelming market share raises concerns about systemic risks, data security, and market fairness. A balanced regulatory framework, effective competition policies, and support for innovation are essential to mitigate vulnerabilities and ensure a secure, inclusive, and resilient digital payment ecosystem in India.

> India's UPI ecosystem is dominated by PhonePe and Google Pay, holding over 80% market share, creating a duopoly that poses systemic risks, data privacy concerns, and stifles competition. Their dominance stems from user-friendly interfaces, early market entry, and strong financial backing. This concentration increases vulnerability to technical failures and market manipulation. To address these risks, the NPCI introduced a 30% market cap rule, promotes alternatives like BHIM UPI, and enforces data localization. Strengthening cybersecurity, fostering fintech innovation, and ensuring effective regulatory measures are crucial for a secure, competitive, and inclusive digital payment ecosystem in India.

# When justice becomes a cruel joke

The four apartments — **Golden Kayaloram, Alfa Serene, H2O Holy Faith, and Jain Coral** — that came up on the banks of **Vembanad Lake** in violation of the **Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ)** norms were pulled down on January 11 and 12, 2020, after evicting its nearly 350 residents. The Supreme Court, which ordered the demolition, had also asked the State government to pay compensation to the tune of ₹25 lakh each to the apartment owners, which eventually has to be recovered from the builders as well as the erring government officials, who gave clearance for the constructions in violation of the laws.

The rationale for ordering the demolition was that the apartment complexes were built in violation of the CRZ 2011 rules which were in force while the buildings were put up. It was also pointed out that the **Maradu panchayat permitted the construction of the apartments without obtaining the prior permission of the Kerala Coastal Zone Management Authority, a prerequisite under the CRZ rules**.

Much water has flowed into **Vembanad Lake since the demolition**.

The CRZ 2011 was replaced with CRZ 2019, which offered more avenues for construction and development activities towards the landward side of water bodies. Kerala recently claimed the benefits of the CRZ 2019 regime by getting its Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP) approved by the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change.

Meanwhile, the top court appears to have changed its mind over the demolition of the buildings. A three-member Bench of the court while empathising with the apartment owners, felt that the buildings could have been saved by imposing heavy costs on the violators.

The court had earlier ordered the demolition of Kapico Resorts, built in Nediyathuruthu, an island in Vembanad Lake in Alappuzha district for violating environmental and coastal rules in 2022. Some portions of another resort built on another backwater island were also demolished for violations. The top court also asked the authorities to crack down on the violations along the lake’s banks and initiate steps to protect the lake system.

Meanwhile, another multi-storied apartment complex, which was also reportedly built in violation of the CRZ rules at Chilavannur, a few kilometres away from the now-razed Maradu apartments, was spared from the detonators and bulldozers by the top court in 2018. A two-member Bench asked the builder DLF Universal Limited, to remit one crore fine to the authority, which could be used for better enforcement of the CRZ rules.

Last week, the top court deputed Gaurav Agarwal, the amicus curiae, to Maradu panchayat to find out whether construction of new apartments would be possible at the site where the four structures once stood. The changed legal status of the holding under the CRZ 2019 regime and the subsequent requests of some of the builders and the apartment owners for permission for construction prompted the top court to explore the possibility.

The holding where the Maradu apartments once stood was included in Zone Three under the CRZ 2011 where the No Development Zone was 100 metres from the High Tide Line.

However, the new CZMP, which was approved for the 10 coastal districts of the State, has included Maradu Municipality in Zone Two, where the restrictions on construction have been significantly eased. The new regime permits construction along the building line of the existing built-up area. It allows construction activities towards the landward side of the authorised structures.

As the authorities are busy drawing the building line to demarcate the areas and assess the extent to which constructions are possible, the developments have left the erstwhile residents fuming. Justice delayed, they say, is justice denied.

While the demolition of the apartments has sent a strong message that the environmental violators would not be left scot-free, the Maradu apartment owners who lost their abode feel they are the victims of the delayed justice and wisdom that prevailed on the top court. They paid dearly for no fault of theirs.

As the top court contemplates undoing what many perceive as an injustice committed to the innocent buyers, its earlier order is unlikely to bring them any solace.

### **Vembanad Lake and Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Rules 2019**

#### **Vembanad Lake: An Ecological Treasure**

Vembanad Lake, located in the state of Kerala, is the largest lake in India and a significant wetland ecosystem. It spans across several districts, including Alappuzha, Kottayam, and Ernakulam, and is a vital part of Kerala's backwater tourism. Recognized as a **Ramsar site** (a wetland of international importance), Vembanad Lake supports diverse biodiversity, including numerous fish species, birds, and aquatic plants. It also plays a crucial role in flood control, groundwater recharge, and sustaining the livelihoods of local communities engaged in agriculture, fishing, and tourism.

However, over the years, Vembanad Lake has faced severe environmental threats due to:

- **Encroachment and Illegal Construction:** Unregulated urban development along its banks has led to habitat destruction and ecological imbalance.  
- **Pollution:** Discharge of industrial effluents, domestic waste, and agricultural runoff has deteriorated water quality.  
- **Sand Mining:** Illegal sand mining has disrupted the lake's ecosystem.  
- **Shrinking Wetlands:** Reclamation of wetlands for construction and farming has reduced the lake's area, affecting biodiversity.

#### **Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Rules: An Overview**

The **Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ)** rules were introduced in **1991** under the **Environment Protection Act, 1986**, to protect coastal ecosystems while balancing developmental needs. The CRZ rules regulate construction, tourism, and industrial activities along India’s coastline to safeguard fragile coastal and marine environments.

##### **CRZ 2011 Regulations:**  
- Divided coastal areas into **four zones (CRZ-I to CRZ-IV)**, with varying degrees of restrictions on development.  
- Mandated a **No Development Zone (NDZ)** of 100 meters from the High Tide Line (HTL) in CRZ-III areas, which applied to areas like Maradu in Kerala.  
- Required prior approval from the **Kerala Coastal Zone Management Authority (KCZMA)** for any construction near ecologically sensitive areas.  

The Maradu apartment complexes were constructed in violation of these rules, leading to the Supreme Court’s demolition order.

#### **Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Rules 2019**

Recognizing the need for sustainable development along coastal areas, the Government of India introduced the **CRZ 2019** regulations, replacing the more restrictive CRZ 2011 rules. The CRZ 2019 rules aimed to strike a balance between environmental protection and coastal development.

**Key Provisions of CRZ 2019:**  

1. **Revised Zoning Classifications:**  
   - **CRZ-I:** Ecologically sensitive areas remain highly protected.  
   - **CRZ-II:** Developed land areas close to the shoreline now have relaxed construction norms.  
   - **CRZ-III:** Divided into **CRZ-IIIA** (densely populated rural areas) and **CRZ-IIIB** (sparsely populated areas), with differential development norms.  
   - **CRZ-IV:** Covers water areas and tidally influenced water bodies.

2. **Reduced No Development Zone (NDZ):**  
   - In CRZ-IIIA areas, the NDZ was reduced to **50 meters** from the HTL instead of the previous 200 meters, allowing more construction activity.  

3. **Promotion of Tourism and Infrastructure:**  
   - Eco-tourism projects, livelihood projects for local communities, and infrastructure development for defense and strategic purposes were allowed with environmental safeguards.  

4. **Streamlined Approvals:**  
   - Simplified and faster approval processes for certain projects through state coastal management authorities, reducing bureaucratic hurdles.  

5. **Landward Development Permitted:**  
   - Construction towards the **landward side** of existing authorized structures is allowed, encouraging urban expansion while protecting ecologically sensitive areas.  

---

#### **Implications of CRZ 2019 for Vembanad Lake**

1. **Relaxed Construction Norms:**  
   - Under CRZ 2019, the **Maradu Municipality** was reclassified into **CRZ-II**, where construction is permitted along the building line of existing built-up areas.  
   - This change has significantly eased construction restrictions around Vembanad Lake, allowing development towards the landward side.  

2. **Environmental Concerns:**  
   - While development opportunities have increased, the relaxed norms could pose risks to the already fragile Vembanad ecosystem.  
   - Without strict enforcement, the lake may face further pollution, encroachment, and biodiversity loss.  

3. **Legal and Ethical Dilemmas:**  
   - The demolition of the Maradu apartments under CRZ 2011 rules appears contentious, given the subsequent relaxation of norms under CRZ 2019.  
   - The affected residents argue that they were unfairly penalized despite purchasing homes in good faith, while similar future constructions could now be legalized.

4. **Sustainable Development Challenges:**  
   - Balancing developmental needs with environmental sustainability is a significant challenge.  
   - The shift in policy must be coupled with robust environmental impact assessments and strict regulatory oversight to prevent ecological degradation.  

---

#### **Way Forward for Sustainable Coastal Management**

1. **Strengthened Regulatory Oversight:**  
   - Ensure stringent enforcement of CRZ 2019 rules to prevent misuse and unauthorized constructions.  
   - Empower local bodies like the **Kerala Coastal Zone Management Authority (KCZMA)** with better resources and authority.

2. **Transparent Approval Processes:**  
   - Implement strict environmental impact assessments before approving large-scale construction near sensitive zones like Vembanad Lake.  

3. **Community Involvement:**  
   - Engage local communities in environmental conservation efforts, ensuring sustainable livelihoods without harming the ecosystem.  

4. **Eco-Friendly Construction:**  
   - Encourage green infrastructure and eco-friendly tourism projects that align with environmental conservation goals.  

5. **Regular Monitoring and Auditing:**  
   - Conduct regular ecological audits of Vembanad Lake and other sensitive areas to assess the impact of developmental activities.  

---

#### **Conclusion**

Vembanad Lake, a vital ecological and economic resource, faces significant environmental threats due to rapid urbanization and policy shifts. The transition from CRZ 2011 to CRZ 2019 reflects India’s attempt to balance environmental protection with developmental needs. However, the Maradu demolition highlights the complexities and consequences of inconsistent enforcement of environmental laws. Moving forward, sustainable and responsible development, coupled with stringent environmental safeguards, is essential to protect Vembanad Lake while supporting economic growth.

> Vembanad Lake, India's largest and an ecologically vital wetland, faces threats from illegal construction and pollution. The demolition of Maradu apartments in Kerala in 2020 highlighted violations of the **CRZ 2011** rules, which restricted construction near coastal areas. However, the introduction of **CRZ 2019** relaxed these norms, allowing construction along existing built-up areas, including Maradu. While this promotes development, it raises environmental concerns for fragile ecosystems like Vembanad. Balancing sustainable development with environmental protection requires stricter regulatory enforcement, eco-friendly construction, community involvement, and regular ecological monitoring to safeguard the lake while enabling responsible growth.

# On India’s obligations towards the Rohingya

A recent study examining the plight of Rohingya refugees detained in India, conducted jointly by The Azadi Project and Refugees International has highlighted “gross violations of constitutional and human rights” and criticised India’s “failure to uphold its obligations under international human rights treaties.” Based on interviews with detainees, their families, and legal representatives, the report reveals that “a significant number of Rohingya refugees continue to be incarcerated even after serving their prescribed sentences.”

### How are Rohingya refugees protected under international law?

The Rohingya people of Myanmar constitute the world’s largest stateless population, estimated to number approximately 2.8 million. Denied citizenship and subjected to decades of persecution by Myanmar’s authorities, majority of the Rohingya have been compelled to flee their homeland due to genocidal violence. At present, they are dispersed across multiple countries. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), nearly 22,500 Rohingya refugees currently reside in India.

The 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol enshrine the principle of non-refoulement, which prohibits States from expelling individuals under their jurisdiction when substantial evidence suggests they would face persecution, torture, or other severe human rights violations upon return. This principle is a cornerstone of human rights, humanitarian, and refugee law. Moreover, its status as customary international law imposes binding obligations on states regardless of formal assent. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has reiterated that “the principle is characterised by its absolute nature without any exception”. Additionally, in a 2007 advisory opinion, the UNHCR affirmed that non-refoulement constitutes customary law and is binding on all states, including those not parties to the Refugee Convention or the 1967 Protocol.

### What is India’s stand?

As India is neither a signatory to the Refugee Convention nor a party to key international instruments, such as the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, it maintains that it bears no legal obligation to provide asylum or adhere to the principle of non-refoulement. India continues to detain Rohingya refugees under archaic domestic legal frameworks, notably the Foreigners Act, 1946, and the Passport Act, 1967. These legislations confer sweeping executive powers to regulate the presence of foreigners and enable authorities to categorise Rohingya refugees as “illegal migrants.”

In response to a public interest litigation (PIL) in the Supreme Court seeking the release of detained Rohingya refugees, the Centre clarified in March that while they are entitled to the right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution, they do not possess the right to reside or settle in India. In 2021, the top court in Mohammad Salimullah and Anr. versus Union of India, rejected a plea to prevent the deportation of 170 Rohingya refugees detained in Srinagar accepting the Centre’s national security concerns.

In October 2024, the Delhi High Court dismissed a PIL seeking directions to the authorities to admit Rohingya refugee children in local schools. The court noted that the matter involved international implications and required a policy decision to be taken by the government.

### What are India’s international obligations?

The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which India is a party, implicitly obligates member states under Article 7 to refrain from refouling individuals to places where they may face torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. The UN Human Rights Committee has unequivocally affirmed this interpretation. Similarly, the principle of non-refoulement is enshrined in other significant international instruments, including the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, both of which India has ratified.

Further, the Convention Against Torture makes an express mention of non-refoulement under Article 3. While India’s position as a signatory but not a ratifier renders its provisions non-binding, any deviation from the convention’s principles would compromise the commitment India demonstrated by signing the treaty.

Although India lacks a domestic refugee law, the Supreme Court in landmark rulings such as Vishaka & Ors. versus State of Rajasthan (1997) and National Legal Services Authority versus Union of India (2014), has affirmed that in the absence of domestic legislation on a matter, international conventions and norms must be applied by municipal courts to ensure the dignity of human life. Additionally, Article 51(c) of the Constitution mandates that the state must strive to promote respect for international law and treaty obligations.

Several High Courts in India have also interpreted the principle of non-refoulement as integral to Article 21 of the Constitution, which guarantees the right to life and personal liberty. Notable examples include the Gujarat High Court’s decision in Ktaer Abbas Habib Al Qutaifi versus Union of India (1998) and the Delhi High Court’s ruling in Dongh Lian Kham versus Union of India (2015), both of which involved refugees from different countries seeking protection from deportation.

### What are the existing concerns?

The absence of a standardised refugee policy has led to the disparate treatment of different refugee populations, driven by India’s shifting geopolitical and diplomatic interests. While groups such as the Tibetans, Sri Lankans, and Afghans are granted refugee certificates or long-term visas by the government, most Rohingya refugees — despite being registered with the UNHCR — often face arbitrary detention and criminal imprisonment. Further, the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019, excludes persecuted Muslim minorities, such as the Rohingya, from its ambit.

The lack of legal representation and aid for detained Rohingya refugees also poses a severe concern. The report by Azadi Project and Refugees International highlights that civil society organisations working on behalf of Rohingya refugees in India are starved of funding as most Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act licences that allow for the receipt of foreign funding have been revoked. This has made lawyers reluctant to take on cases involving the Rohingya, fearing potential repercussions.

Moreover, detention centres housing Rohingya refugees, including pregnant women and children, are plagued by dehumanising living conditions. In light of the appalling conditions at the Matia Transit Camp, the Supreme Court in October, directed the Assam State Legal Services to conduct surprise visits and evaluate the conditions in which the refugees are living.

> India's obligations towards the Rohingya refugees stem from its commitment to humanitarian principles and international law, despite not being a signatory to the **1951 Refugee Convention** or its **1967 Protocol**. India is bound by international customary law and its constitutional principles, including the right to life and dignity under **Article 21**. India must balance national security concerns with humanitarian protection for Rohingya refugees fleeing persecution in Myanmar. Upholding non-refoulement (not returning refugees to danger), providing basic amenities, and collaborating with international agencies like the **UNHCR** align with India's global human rights responsibilities.
