# Research security should be a national priority

As India aims to achieve its development objectives by **2047**, the government has laid an emphasis on the role of science and technology in strategic and emerging sectors. Investment in cutting-edge technologies is essential to stay globally competitive, address societal challenges and unlock economic opportunities. Like in many nations, India is building an innovation ecosystem to harness the transformative power of these technologies. However, along with this intensification of research and development (R&D) arises a new challenge — research security.

While collaboration and the free exchange of knowledge are fundamental to scientific progress, there are new risks in the rapidly evolving geopolitical landscape. Foreign interference, intellectual property theft, insider threats, cyberattacks, and unauthorised access to sensitive information are concerns for countries investing in advanced technologies. If left unaddressed, they could undermine India’s progress in strategic sectors. Research security, in this context, refers to safeguarding scientific research from threats to confidentiality, economic value, or national interest. India is ramping up investments in strategic technologies which include space, defence, semiconductors, nuclear technology, cybersecurity, biotechnology, clean energy, artificial intelligence, and quantum technology. So, ensuring strategic research outputs remain protected is critical. Any breach of security could compromise national interests, delay technological advancements, and expose sensitive data to exploitation by foreign actors.

Policymakers must focus on strengthening research security as a part of India’s broader science and technology strategy. This involves a concerted effort to protect sensitive data, intellectual property, research infrastructure, and personnel. Preventing espionage, sabotage, and adversarial foreign influence are essential to safeguard India’s R&D investment.

### The global landscape, China factor

The issue of research security is not far-fetched, as there have been several cases of research security breaches around the world with serious consequences.

In a famous case, a senior professor at Harvard University and his two Chinese students were arrested for not-disclosing their links to Chinese funding, while also receiving funding from the U.S. Department of Defense. In another case, COVID-19 vaccine research facilities were subject to cyber attacks in 2020 to steal sensitive vaccine research and development data. The European Space Agency (ESA) has also suffered several cyberattacks to sabotage or steal sensitive information, prompting ESA to develop a partnership with the European Defence Agency on cybersecurity.

Such incidents have prompted several countries to develop policies and guidelines to strengthen research security. The US CHIPS and Science Act has several provisions on research security, which are complemented by other guidelines; these include the research security framework of the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Canada has come up with National Security Guidelines for Research Partnerships and a Policy on Sensitive Technology Research and Affiliations of Concern, along with a list of sensitive technologies.

Moreover, the country has identified research institutions — primarily from China, Iran, and Russia — with which collaborations should be avoided. The European Council’s recommendation is taking a different approach based on the principles of self-governance by the sector, a risk-based and proportionate response, and country-agonistic regulations. It underlines the need to establish a centre of expertise on research security and highlights research security-related guidelines for Horizon Europe, the primary research funding programme of the EU. Several of these initiatives are partially driven as responses to the military-civil fusion strategy of the Chinese Communist Party, which promotes the use of dual-use technology, technology transfer, funding and foreign collaborations; there is a close nexus between China’s defence industry, universities and research institutions to develop and share strategic research and technologies between the civilian and military sectors.

### Promoting research security in India

Unfortunately, the concept of research security has received little attention in academic circles and government policymaking, leading to vulnerabilities that adversarial actors could exploit. The first step would be to systematically map the security vulnerabilities in our research ecosystem. This would involve understanding the nature of foreign influence in our universities, assessing the vulnerabilities of key research labs and sensitive research infrastructure, analysing foreign collaborations and funding in strategic technologies, and reviewing the personnel hiring and access control practices to comprehend possible insider threats in the crucial research facilities. For this, government agencies and research institutions need to deliberate on possible steps to make strategic research more secure while avoiding over-regulation. Further, engagement with trusted international partners could be explored for the initial capacity building and awareness-raising in this area.

Concrete steps would require security and intelligence agencies to engage with researchers and develop an understanding of the sensitive research areas. This would also necessitate the classification of research in different categories based on strategic value, possible economic impact and the national security implications. Thus, a research security framework could be developed providing research security guidelines. Here, a risk-based and proportionate response approach similar to the one recommended by the European Council could be considered as it seeks to avoid over-regulation while reducing security risks. There would be a requirement to develop a research security surveillance mechanism to keep tabs on emerging risks.

### Observe these cautions

There are several in-principle and practical challenges for research security. For instance, science is inherently international and collaborative in nature and international collaborations are crucial drivers of scientific progress. Research security seeks to restrict certain funding and collaborations, which would be opposed by researchers for infringing on academic freedom and hindering scientific progress. Similarly, research security would also have to find a balance with open science, which includes sharing of research infrastructure, open data, and involving the general public in the scientific research via citizen science. Rightfully, open science is promoted by governments, funding agencies, science academies, and individual researchers.

Another major challenge would be the additional administrative and regulatory burden that research security would bring to research institutions and individual researchers, already strangled by the overly bureaucratic nature of our institutions and funding agencies. It is crucial that research security is implemented in close collaboration with the technical experts rather than security and intelligence agencies making decisions without full understanding of the matter. It is important that research security should not become an instrument of political interference in academic institutions.

Research security would require significant funding, effective communication, engagement, and capacity building to create a cadre of professionals who could design, develop, implement and lead research security efforts in India. A dedicated office similar to one at the U.S. National Science Foundation could be created for research security in the newly established Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF). Such an office could become a focal point for coordinating and synergising efforts for research security among security agencies and academic institutions. Finally, researchers should be engaged at all levels of decision-making to find the right balance of security issues with open science, regulatory burden and scientific progress. Here, the spirit of ‘as open as possible and as closed as necessary’ could help guide decision-making.

> Research security is essential for safeguarding a nation’s intellectual assets, technological advancements, and strategic interests. As global competition intensifies, protecting research from theft, espionage, and cyberattacks is crucial to maintaining economic and national security. Prioritizing research security ensures innovation remains indigenous, supports defense capabilities, and strengthens global competitiveness. Measures like stricter data protection laws, collaboration between academia and security agencies, and fostering a culture of ethical research practices are vital. By treating research security as a national priority, governments can protect critical intellectual property, advance technological leadership, and secure the nation’s future in a highly interconnected and competitive world.

# India’s cities, their non-communicable disease burden

### Addressing Urban Health Challenges in Marginalized Communities

Urbanization has significantly reshaped India’s socio-economic and health landscapes, highlighting the vulnerabilities of marginalized urban populations. These include informal and migrant workers, sanitation workers, and gig workers, who play a crucial role in maintaining the functionality of cities but often remain deprived of basic healthcare, hygiene, and social security. As cities expand, addressing these inequities becomes essential for sustainable urban living and public health.

---

### **The Urban Health Burden**

Urban marginalized communities face a **triple health burden**:
1. **Hazardous Work Environments**: Workers like sanitation staff and gig workers are exposed to physical risks and unhygienic conditions without adequate protections such as health insurance or contracts.
2. **Limited Health-Care Access**: Public healthcare systems in urban areas, designed to cater to all, fail to adequately serve marginalized groups due to overburdened infrastructure and poor accessibility.
3. **Financial Vulnerability**: Health crises often lead to catastrophic out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditures, destabilizing families economically.

These challenges are compounded by rising non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. The **NFHS (National Family Health Survey)** data shows that while there has been a decline in tobacco and alcohol consumption, NCD prevalence has increased, particularly among urban populations.

---

### **Barriers to Effective Healthcare for Urban Marginals**

1. **Fragmented Systems**: Urban health systems are fragmented, underfunded, and fail to integrate community-level screening and preventive care effectively.
2. **Social Determinants of Health (SDoH)**:
   - Poor housing, inadequate sanitation, and hazardous workplaces directly affect health outcomes.
   - Social identities, migration status, and language barriers further limit access to care.
3. **Lack of Preventive Pathways**: Insufficient awareness about regular screenings and early detection of NCDs exacerbates the burden of these silent diseases, leading to delayed interventions and worsening health outcomes.
4. **Generational Impact**: Poor health outcomes in marginalized families often persist across generations due to systemic neglect, perpetuating cycles of poverty and ill-health.

---

### **Improving Urban Health: Policy and Implementation**

#### **Primary Health Care Gaps**
India’s primary healthcare system, particularly in urban areas, remains inaccessible to marginalized groups. Public health systems should focus on:
1. **Universal Health Coverage**: Strengthening public healthcare to cater to the lowest 40% of the population effectively.
2. **Preventive Care**: Integrating NCD screenings into community-level healthcare and linking them with referral systems to improve early detection and treatment pathways.
3. **Community Engagement**: Involving local communities to design healthcare interventions that address their specific needs.

#### **Policy Implementation Challenges**
Although India has policies like the national non-communicable diseases (NCD) surveillance program, their implementation remains weak due to:
- Poor urban design and rapid urbanization.
- Lack of interdepartmental collaboration.
- Insufficient resources allocated to health promotion and care.

---

### **Role of Technology in Urban Health**

The digital age provides opportunities to address health inequities effectively. Technology can revolutionize urban healthcare systems by enabling:
1. **Real-Time Monitoring**: Digital tools can allow individuals with hypertension, diabetes, and other NCDs to monitor their health parameters through apps or wearables, promoting a "health in our hands" approach.
2. **Epidemiological Evidence**: Screening at the population level can provide valuable data for public health planning and resource allocation.
3. **Integrated Solutions**: Linking health records with public health programs can improve continuity of care and streamline referrals.

---

### **Interconnected Systems for Health**

The interconnectedness of urban systems—healthcare, workplaces, municipalities, traffic systems, and schools—necessitates a collaborative approach. Addressing urban health challenges requires:
- Active dialogue among stakeholders, including employers, policymakers, and healthcare providers.
- Co-creation of community-driven solutions to improve access, awareness, and affordability of care.
- Improved workplace policies to ensure health insurance, hygiene facilities, and safe working conditions for marginalized workers.

---

### **Recommendations for Sustainable Solutions**

1. **Strengthening Primary Healthcare**:
   - Establish more urban health centers focused on marginalized populations.
   - Train healthcare workers to address NCDs and provide culturally sensitive care.
2. **Empowering Marginalized Workers**:
   - Mandate health insurance for informal workers through government or employer initiatives.
   - Improve sanitation and hygiene at workplaces to reduce health risks.
3. **Education and Awareness**:
   - Conduct campaigns to educate urban populations about preventive health measures, such as regular NCD screenings.
   - Encourage schools and workplaces to promote healthy lifestyles.
4. **Policy Integration**:
   - Align urban planning with health policies to create more inclusive cities.
   - Strengthen implementation mechanisms for existing health policies, ensuring they reach the intended beneficiaries.

---

### **Conclusion**

India’s urban marginalized communities, integral to city functioning, face severe health inequities stemming from hazardous environments, inadequate healthcare access, and poor policy implementation. Addressing these challenges requires a multi-pronged approach that integrates technology, robust public health systems, and community-driven solutions. By prioritizing preventive care, strengthening primary healthcare, and leveraging digital tools, India can ensure equitable health outcomes for its most vulnerable citizens, paving the way for sustainable urbanization and social equity.

# What India’s AI Safety Institute could do

In October, the **Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY)** convened meetings with industry and experts to discuss setting up an **AI Safety Institute** under the **IndiaAI Mission**. Curiously, this came on the heels of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the U.S., the Quad Leaders’ Summit, and the United Nations Summit of the Future. AI appeared high on the agenda in the run up to the Summit of the Future, with a high-level UN advisory panel producing a report on Governing AI for Humanity.

Policymakers should build on India’s recent leadership at the **G20** and the **GPAI**, and position it as a unifying voice for the global majority in AI governance. The design of the Safety Institute should prioritise raising domestic capacity, capitalising on India’s comparative advantages, and plugging into international initiatives.

Notably, the Summit of the Future yielded the Global Digital Compact that identifies multi-stakeholder collaboration, human-centric oversight, and inclusive participation of developing countries as essential pillars of AI governance and safety. As a follow up, the UN will now commence a Global Dialogue on AI. It would be timely for India to establish an AI Safety Institute which engages with the Bletchley Process on AI Safety. If executed correctly, India can deepen the global dialogue on AI safety and bring global majority perspectives on human centric safety to the forefront of discussions.

### Institutional reform

In designing the institute, India should learn from concerns stemming from MeitY’s AI Advisory in March 2024, which proposed that there be government approvals before the public roll-out of experimental AI systems. Some asked what kind of institutional capability the Indian government had to suitably determine the safety of novel AI deployments. Other provisions on bias, discrimination, and the one-size-fits-all treatment of all AI deployments indicated that the advisory was not based on technical evidence.

Similarly, India should be cautious and avoid prescriptive regulatory controls which have been proposed in the **European Union (EU)** and **China**. The threat of regulatory sanction in a rapidly evolving technological ecosystem quells proactive information sharing between businesses, governments, and the wider ecosystem. It nudges labs to only undertake the minimum steps towards compliance. Yet each jurisdiction demonstrates a recurring recognition of establishing specialised agencies — for example, China’s Algorithm Registry and the EU’s AI Office. However, to maximise the promise of institutional reform, India should decouple institution building from regulation making.

The **Bletchley process** is underscored by the U.K. Safety Summit in November 2023 and the South Korea Safety Summit in May 2024. The next summit is set for France and this process is yielding an international network of AI Safety Institutes.

The U.S. and the U.K. were the first two to set up these institutes and have already signed an MoU to exchange knowledge, resources, and expertise. Both institutions are also signing MoUs with AI labs and receiving early access to large foundation models. They have installed mechanisms to share technical inputs with the AI labs before their public roll outs. These Safety Institutes facilitate proactive information sharing without being regulators. They are positioned as technical government institutions that leverage multi-stakeholder consortiums and partnerships to assess the risk of frontier AI models to public safety. However, they largely consider AI safety through the lens of cybersecurity, infrastructure security, safety of the biosphere, and other national security threats.

These safety institutes aim to improve government capacity and mainstream the idea of external third-party testing and risk mitigations and assessments. Government-led AI safety institutes aim to deliver insights which can transform AI governance into an evidence-based discipline. The Bletchley process presents India with an opportunity to collaborate with governments and stakeholders from across the world. Shared expertise will be essential to keep up with AI’s rapid innovation trajectories.

### Charting India’s approach

India should establish an AI Safety Institute which integrates into the Bletchley network of safety institutes. For now, it should be independent from rulemaking and enforcement authorities and, instead, operate exclusively as a technical research, testing, and standardisation agency. It would allow India’s domestic institutions to tap into the expertise of other governments, local multi-stakeholder communities, and international businesses. While upscaling its AI oversight capabilities, India can also use the Bletchley network to advance the global majority’s concerns with AI’s individual centric risks.

The institute could champion perspectives on risks relating to bias, discrimination, social exclusion, gendered risks, labour markets, data collection and individual privacy. Consequently, it could deepen the global dialogue around harm identification, big picture AI risks, mitigations, red-teaming, and standardisation. If done right, India may become a global steward for forward-thinking AI governance which embraces many stakeholders and government collaboration. The AI Safety Institute can demonstrate India’s scientific temper and willingness to implement globally compatible, evidence-based and proportionate policy solutions.

The **India AI Mission** aims to position India as a global leader in Artificial Intelligence (AI) by leveraging its vast talent pool, data resources, and innovation ecosystem. The initiative is driven by the Government of India, focusing on developing and deploying AI solutions for societal benefit, economic growth, and ethical AI practices.

# Plastic treaty talks fail over production cuts

### Plastic Treaty Talks Stall Over Production Cuts

The recent round of international talks aimed at finalizing a **global treaty to combat plastic pollution** faced a significant deadlock over the issue of production cuts. Delegates from various nations struggled to find common ground on measures to curb plastic production, an essential step to reducing the environmental crisis caused by plastic waste.

---

### **Background**

Plastic pollution is a global concern, with over 400 million tonnes of plastic produced annually, of which only a fraction is recycled. The remaining plastic ends up in landfills, oceans, and ecosystems, harming wildlife, contaminating food chains, and contributing to climate change. Recognizing this, the United Nations initiated negotiations for a legally binding treaty on plastic pollution, aiming for its adoption by 2024. However, disagreements have slowed progress.

---

### **Key Issues in the Talks**

1. **Production Cuts**:
   - A coalition of nations, including members of the European Union and developing countries most affected by plastic pollution, demanded legally binding targets for reducing plastic production.
   - Major plastic-producing countries, including the United States and Gulf nations, opposed mandatory production cuts, arguing instead for improved waste management and recycling technologies.

# In our fight against climate change, could the seas turn the tide?

### The Ocean’s Role in Climate Regulation and Its Challenges

The ocean, covering over 70% of the Earth’s surface, plays a crucial role in regulating the planet’s climate. Often referred to as the Earth’s “blue lung,” it acts as a massive buffer against climate change by absorbing heat and carbon dioxide (CO₂). However, this indispensable function comes with profound ecological consequences that threaten marine ecosystems and their critical services to humanity.

---

### **Ocean as a Climate Buffer**

1. **Carbon Sink**:
   - The ocean absorbs approximately **25% of anthropogenic CO₂ emissions**, reducing the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
   - This carbon absorption is primarily facilitated by the **biological pump**, where marine organisms like phytoplankton absorb CO₂ during photosynthesis and transfer it to deeper waters upon death.

2. **Heat Absorption**:
   - Over **90% of the excess heat generated by greenhouse gases** is stored in the ocean, moderating surface temperatures and delaying the worst impacts of global warming.

These processes have bought humankind critical time to address climate change, but they are not limitless.

---

### **The Cost of Absorption: Ecological Consequences**

1. **Ocean Acidification**:
   - The absorbed CO₂ reacts with seawater to form carbonic acid, reducing pH levels in a process known as **acidification**.
   - Acidification severely impacts calcifying organisms such as corals, shellfish, and some plankton, weakening their ability to build skeletons and shells.
   - Coral reefs, biodiversity hotspots, are particularly vulnerable, with cascading effects on species that rely on them for food and habitat.

2. **Warming and Circulation Disruption**:
   - Rising ocean temperatures alter major ocean circulation patterns like the **Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC)**, impacting weather systems globally.
   - Warmer waters deoxygenate vital marine habitats, creating **dead zones** where life struggles to survive.

3. **Pollution and Biogeochemical Disruption**:
   - Excessive nutrient runoff from agriculture leads to harmful algal blooms, further depleting oxygen levels in coastal areas.
   - Plastic and chemical pollution compound the stress on marine life, interfering with ecosystems already strained by climate impacts.

---

### **Impact on Marine Ecosystems and Human Dependence**

1. **Ecosystem Disruption**:
   - Marine food webs are destabilized as species struggle to adapt to changing conditions.
   - Keystone species like corals and phytoplankton decline, reducing biodiversity and ecosystem resilience.

2. **Loss of Ecosystem Services**:
   - Fisheries: Warming waters and habitat degradation threaten global fish stocks, risking food security for billions.
   - Carbon Sequestration: Disrupted marine ecosystems reduce the ocean’s ability to absorb and store carbon.

3. **Economic and Social Costs**:
   - Coastal communities dependent on fisheries and marine tourism face economic instability.
   - The loss of natural coastal defenses like coral reefs increases vulnerability to storms and sea-level rise.

---

### **Mitigating the Challenges**

1. **Reducing Emissions**:
   - Drastically cutting greenhouse gas emissions is essential to reduce the burden on oceans.
   - Transitioning to renewable energy and implementing carbon capture technologies can help slow acidification and warming.

2. **Protecting Marine Ecosystems**:
   - Expanding **Marine Protected Areas (MPAs)** can shield vulnerable ecosystems from overfishing and pollution.
   - Restoring degraded habitats like mangroves and seagrasses enhances biodiversity and carbon storage capacity.

3. **Global Collaboration**:
   - International agreements, such as the **Paris Agreement** and the **UN Decade of Ocean Science**, are critical to fostering coordinated efforts for ocean conservation.

4. **Innovative Solutions**:
   - Exploring geoengineering options, such as alkalinity enhancement, to counteract acidification while ensuring their safety for ecosystems.

---

### **Conclusion**

The ocean’s immense capacity to regulate climate has been a lifeline for humanity, absorbing CO₂ and heat to delay catastrophic impacts. However, these processes come with ecological costs that jeopardize marine ecosystems and the services they provide. Addressing this requires urgent and collective global action to reduce emissions, protect marine biodiversity, and develop sustainable ocean management practices. By safeguarding the ocean, we ensure its continued role as a vital buffer in the fight against climate change.

> The ocean, a critical buffer against climate change, absorbs 25% of human-generated CO₂ emissions and over 90% of excess heat, delaying catastrophic impacts. However, this comes at a cost: ocean acidification, deoxygenation, disrupted circulation, and pollution harm marine ecosystems, threatening biodiversity and essential services like fisheries and carbon sequestration. Calcifying organisms like corals and shellfish are particularly vulnerable, destabilizing food webs and coastal economies. To mitigate these impacts, urgent action is needed to reduce emissions, protect marine biodiversity, expand marine protected areas, and implement sustainable ocean management. Safeguarding the ocean is essential for climate resilience and global ecological balance.

# Trump warns BRICS nations of 100% tariffs if they undermine U.S. dollar

### Analysis and Commentary on Donald Trump’s Statements on BRICS and Tariffs

---

#### **"President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday threatened 100% tariffs against a bloc of nine nations if they act to undermine the U.S. dollar."**

- **Comment**: This statement reflects a hardline approach to economic diplomacy, where tariffs are used as leverage to maintain the dominance of the U.S. dollar. However, such threats may escalate trade tensions and encourage the targeted nations to accelerate their de-dollarisation efforts. The statement underlines the U.S.'s sensitivity to the dollar's global status but risks alienating key trading partners.

---

#### **"His threat was directed at countries in the so-called BRICS alliance, which consists of Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates."**

- **Comment**: BRICS, initially a five-member alliance (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa), has expanded to include key developing economies like Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the UAE. This expansion signals growing geopolitical and economic clout. Targeting this bloc with tariffs is risky, as these nations represent a significant portion of global trade and GDP. It may also drive these countries to solidify their alliances and move further away from dollar dependency.

---

#### **"The dollar represents roughly 58% of the world’s foreign exchange reserves, according to the IMF and major commodities like oil are still primarily bought and sold using dollars."**

- **Comment**: The dominance of the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency has been a cornerstone of global trade and finance since the Bretton Woods Agreement. However, its dominance is gradually eroding due to economic diversification and geopolitical shifts. BRICS nations advocating non-dollar transactions challenge the U.S.'s financial hegemony. While the dollar remains dominant, its share has been declining, which highlights the urgency behind Mr. Trump’s rhetoric.

---

#### **"The dollar’s dominance is threatened with BRICS’ growing share of GDP and the alliance’s intent to trade in non-dollar currencies — a process known as de-dollarisation."**

- **Comment**: De-dollarisation efforts by BRICS represent a long-term strategy to reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar, allowing these nations to mitigate the risks of sanctions and dollar volatility. The growing share of BRICS in global GDP, coupled with their interest in establishing alternative trade mechanisms, is a legitimate challenge to U.S. financial dominance. However, implementing de-dollarisation on a large scale requires robust financial systems, trust in alternative currencies, and geopolitical stability, which remains a work in progress.

---

#### **"Mr. Trump, in a Truth Social post, said: 'We require a commitment from these Countries that they will neither create a new BRICS Currency, nor back any other Currency to replace the mighty U.S. Dollar or, they will face 100% Tariffs, and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful U.S. Economy.'"**

- **Comment**: This statement reveals a coercive stance toward economic diplomacy, using the U.S.'s significant market size as leverage. However, this approach risks backfiring by pushing these nations to develop alternative markets and trading frameworks, thereby accelerating de-dollarisation. The demand for a commitment against creating a BRICS currency or supporting an alternative currency undermines the sovereignty of these nations, potentially provoking stronger resistance. Additionally, the rhetoric of "100% tariffs" risks disrupting global supply chains and trade relationships.

---

#### **Broader Implications of Trump’s Threats**

1. **Economic Ramifications**:
   - Imposing 100% tariffs would escalate trade wars, increasing costs for American consumers and businesses reliant on imports from BRICS nations.
   - Retaliatory measures by BRICS countries could harm U.S. exports, weakening industries and exacerbating trade imbalances.

2. **Geopolitical Fallout**:
   - Such threats may unify BRICS nations and their allies against the U.S., strengthening the bloc’s resolve to pursue de-dollarisation and alternative financial systems.
   - It could encourage other non-BRICS nations to explore diversified trade mechanisms, further undermining dollar dominance.

3. **Global Stability**:
   - The global economy relies on predictable trade and financial systems. Aggressive policies like 100% tariffs risk destabilizing international markets, causing ripple effects worldwide.

4. **Undermining U.S. Influence**:
   - While the U.S. remains a dominant global player, such measures could erode its soft power by alienating key partners and fostering perceptions of economic bullying.

---

#### **Recommendations for a Balanced Approach**

1. **Engage Diplomatically**:
   - Instead of coercion, the U.S. could engage BRICS nations diplomatically to address mutual concerns and collaborate on global financial stability.

2. **Strengthen Dollar Resilience**:
   - Focus on enhancing the dollar's appeal by maintaining economic stability, promoting open trade policies, and addressing domestic fiscal challenges.

3. **Diversify Economic Relations**:
   - Reducing overreliance on BRICS imports and fostering trade with other emerging markets could mitigate potential fallout from de-dollarisation efforts.

4. **Invest in Global Cooperation**:
   - Work through international bodies like the IMF and WTO to develop inclusive financial systems that address the concerns of developing nations while preserving global economic order.

---

### **Conclusion**

Donald Trump’s threats against BRICS nations underscore the growing tension around de-dollarisation and global economic shifts. While the dominance of the U.S. dollar remains significant, coercive measures like tariffs could have adverse consequences, accelerating the very changes they aim to prevent. A balanced approach, combining diplomacy, economic resilience, and global cooperation, is essential to maintaining the U.S.’s financial leadership in an increasingly multipolar world.

> Donald Trump’s threats of 100% tariffs against BRICS nations over their de-dollarisation efforts reflect growing tensions surrounding the U.S. dollar's global dominance. While the dollar remains the primary reserve currency, BRICS' rising economic influence and push for non-dollar trade challenge this position. Coercive measures like tariffs risk escalating trade wars, harming global supply chains, and uniting BRICS against the U.S., potentially accelerating de-dollarisation. Instead, the U.S. should focus on diplomacy, strengthening the dollar's appeal, and fostering inclusive financial systems. Collaborative strategies are essential to maintaining global economic stability and the U.S.’s financial leadership in an increasingly multipolar world.

### **Factors Contributing to Low FLFP**

1. **Social and Cultural Barriers**:
   - Traditional gender roles and patriarchal norms restrict women’s ability to participate in the workforce.
   - Societal expectations around caregiving and household responsibilities fall disproportionately on women.

2. **Educational Mismatch**:
   - Although more women are pursuing higher education, the lack of opportunities matching their skills leads to underemployment or withdrawal from the labor force.

3. **Lack of Supportive Infrastructure**:
   - Inadequate childcare facilities, eldercare services, and safe transportation discourage women from entering or remaining in the workforce.

4. **Gender Pay Gap**:
   - Women often earn less than men for similar work, making employment less economically rewarding.

5. **Job Availability**:
   - Decline in labor-intensive industries like textiles and handicrafts has reduced job opportunities for women in rural areas.
   - Automation in agriculture and manufacturing has displaced many women workers.

6. **Safety Concerns**:
   - Workplace harassment and lack of safe commuting options deter women from working outside the home.

7. **Unpaid Work**:
   - Women spend a disproportionate amount of time on unpaid domestic and caregiving work, limiting their availability for paid employment.

### **Impact of Low FLFP on India**

1. **Economic Implications**:
   - A low FLFP reduces India’s potential GDP. According to a McKinsey report, increasing FLFP to match men’s participation could add **$700 billion** to India’s GDP by 2025.
   - It also limits household incomes, impacting overall economic well-being.

2. **Social Inequalities**:
   - Low FLFP exacerbates gender inequalities in income, decision-making, and social status.
   - Women’s absence from the workforce reinforces traditional stereotypes.

3. **Missed Talent Pool**:
   - Underutilization of educated and skilled women restricts innovation, diversity, and productivity in various sectors.

### **Conclusion**

Increasing female labour force participation is essential for India’s economic growth, social progress, and gender equality. Addressing systemic barriers through infrastructure, policy reforms, and cultural shifts can unlock the vast potential of India’s women. By creating a more inclusive workforce, India can enhance its global competitiveness while fostering a more equitable society.

> The care economy encompasses paid and unpaid caregiving work essential for societal functioning, including childcare, eldercare, and healthcare. Women disproportionately bear the unpaid caregiving burden, limiting their participation in the labor force. Challenges include low wages for paid care workers, inadequate infrastructure, and policy gaps. A robust care economy enables gender equality and economic growth by reducing caregiving burdens and improving access to affordable services. India’s upcoming national policy on female labor participation, focusing on a viable care economy, is a key step. Investments in childcare, eldercare, fair wages for care workers, and shared responsibilities are vital for inclusivity and progress.
