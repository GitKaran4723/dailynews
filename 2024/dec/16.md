# Why simultaneous elections are impractical and complicated

In recent weeks, there has been increasing discussion about the possibility of having national and State elections at the same time, popularly known as **‘one nation, one election’**. The formation of a committee, helmed by a former President of India, Ram Nath Kovind, to determine how this might be implemented, and what manner of constitutional changes might be required to make it a legal reality, have generated further debate. The primary arguments in favour of simultaneous elections are twofold: **first**, that it will decrease the costs of conducting elections (and of electioneering); and **second**, that it will free up political parties from being in ‘permanent campaign mode’, and allow them to focus on governance (and, for that matter, constructive opposition) for a five-year period.

### Point and counterpoint

Against this, critics have pointed out that when you crunch the numbers, the actual financial savings are relatively minuscule. Furthermore, it is a relatively recent pathology of the Indian political system that central government Ministers and politicians spend a significant amount of time campaigning in State elections: if the concern, therefore, is that frequent State elections hamper governance and the business of Parliament, then simultaneous elections seem a needlessly complicated answer when a simple one is available: that State elections should be primarily fought by State party units, while national politicians can get on with the task of governance. The reality, however, is that the increasingly centralised — and presidential — character of Indian election campaigns means that this is unlikely to be a reality in the near future.

Critics of simultaneous elections have raised a few other objections. **First**, the logistical nightmare of conducting simultaneous elections in a country of a little over 1.4 billion people, in a context where even State elections need to take place in multiple phases.

The **second**, and graver concern, is the incompatibility of a rigid election timetable with some of the fundamentals of parliamentary democracy: as is well-known, at the time of Independence, central and State elections were conducted simultaneously. This arrangement broke down towards the end of the 1960s because of the use of **Article 356 of the Constitution**, which authorises the Union to suspend (or even dismiss) State governments in a narrowly-defined range of circumstances; but also, and apart from that, the essence of parliamentary democracy is that at all times, the government must enjoy the confidence of the House, failing which it must step down, and go back to the people for a fresh mandate.

Consequently, it is obvious that even if, legally and practically, one is able to synchronise central and State elections for one cycle, this will break down the moment a government falls. To this, two solutions have been proposed, both of which tend to make the problem worse. The **first** is that President’s Rule (that is, central rule) will be imposed in that State until the five-year-period is over. Needless to say, this will starkly **undermine both federalism and democracy**. The **second** is that elections will be held in that State, but the term of the new Assembly will only be until the next cycle (which could be in a year, or three years, or four years). Not only does this undercut both the justifications for simultaneous elections — cost and an avoidance of continuous campaign — but, rather, leads to perverse incentives (for example, how much ‘governance’ will a State government be able to do if elections are scheduled in a year?).

### The possibility of ‘horse-trading’

The upshot of this is that there will be a strong push towards avoiding the fall of a government, even when it has lost the confidence of the House in the ordinary course of things. And, as we have seen in India, there is an almost institutionalised remedy for this: defections, or “horse-trading”. It is, by now, clear that the Tenth Schedule’s prohibition on horse-trading has been rendered more or less a dead letter, as politicians have found various ways to get around this (and courts have not been successful in stopping it). Thus, as was pointed out by lawyer and parliamentarian Kapil Sibal in an interview recently, simultaneous elections are likely to see an explosion of horse-trading, where the political parties with the biggest pockets will be the biggest beneficiaries.

While these intractable issues speak to the implementation of simultaneous elections, at a deeper level, there are two principled and interrelated arguments against the idea: federalism and democracy.

**First**, let us take federalism. Over the years, it has increasingly come to be accepted that Indian federalism is not simply a matter of administrative convenience but also a matter of principle that recognises the legitimacy of linguistic, cultural, ethnic, and other forms of collective aspiration, through the grant of Statehood. In this context, there is, of course, Indian democracy at the central level, but also, at the level of each State, democracy takes its own set of claims, demands, and aspirations. Simultaneous elections risk a blurring of these distinct forums and arenas of democracy, with the risk that State-level issues will be subsumed into the national (this is inevitable, given the cognitive dominance of the national, as well as the fact that national-level parties frequently campaign in a national register, for understandable reasons).

### Keeping absolute power in check

A related point is that in our constitutional scheme, the federal structure is an important check upon the concentration of power (buttressed by the existence of the Rajya Sabha at the central level).

The federal structure, in turn, is sustained by a plurality of democratic contests, and a plurality of political outfits, at the State level. Simultaneous elections, for the reasons pointed out above, risk undermining that plurality, and risk precisely the kind of concentration of power that federalism is meant to be a bulwark against.

Second, on democracy: despite the ringing words with which the Preamble of the Constitution begins, the “People” have very little space in the Constitution, especially when it comes to exercising control over their representatives. Unlike many other Constitutions, where public participation in law-making is a guaranteed right, along with other rights such as the right to recall, in the Indian constitutional scheme, elections are the only form of public participation in the public sphere. There is a different conversation to be had about why this is not enough, but given this framework, relatively regular and frequent elections allow for more extended public participation and debate; simultaneous elections would shrink this scope substantially, without any countervailing changes to deepen it in other domains.

Therefore, it is clear that the administrative benefits from simultaneous elections are overstated at best, and non-existent at worst. However, the costs, both in the implementation and in the concept itself, are significant, and create non-trivial risks when it comes to protecting and preserving the federal and democratic design of the Constitution. These, therefore, are good reasons why the idea is a bad one, and ought not to be acted upon.

> Simultaneous elections, where all elections are held together, are often considered impractical and complicated due to several reasons. The logistics of aligning state and national electoral cycles are difficult, as each state has unique political conditions and challenges. Additionally, the risk of national issues overshadowing local concerns could undermine the relevance of state-level elections. Moreover, it would require significant constitutional and legal amendments, and managing the huge scale of such elections could strain resources. The potential for political instability and abrupt changes in governance also complicates the concept, making it difficult to implement in a diverse, federal system like India.

# Why is the BJD opposing the Polavaram project?

**Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu** has vowed to complete the **Polavaram Project on River Godavari by 2027** as the interstate dispute involving mainly **Odisha, Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh** has entered a crucial phase. The Union government has assured ₹15,000 crore in this year’s budget for the completion of the project.

However, the BJD has alleged that the CWC had refused to conduct a backwater study for the revised design flood, despite the recommendations of experts and the Odisha Government’s concerns regarding the safety of tribal populations. The BJD argued that various studies, including those by the Government of Andhra Pradesh and CWC, have shown different estimates for submergence levels. **“A backwater study by AP in 2009 indicates that 50-lakh cusec flood will cause submergence up to 216 feet in Odisha, far exceeding the originally agreed maximum level of 174.22 feet. A report from IIT Roorkee in 2019 further estimates that a flood of 58 lakh cusecs would result in submergence levels of Reservoir Level of 232.28 feet in Odisha,”** it said.

### How did the project start?

The **Polavaram Irrigation Project** on the river Godavari was conceived as a part of the recommendations of the **Godavari Water Disputes Tribunal (GWDT)**. Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha had entered into an agreement dated April 2, 1980, where the project was to be executed by Andhra Pradesh. As per the Andhra Pradesh State Reorganization Act (APRA), 2014, the Polavaram Irrigation Project was declared as a national project.

In response to an RTI query, the **Ministry of Jal Shakti** said that the maximum height of the concrete dam of Polavaram Project, measured from the deepest foundation level (-18.50m) to the top of bridge is 72.60 metre. The initial project cost was ₹10,151.04 crore in 2005-06 which reached ₹55,548.87 crore in 2019.

### What are the concerns?

Though no comprehensive study has been carried out with regards to the likely submergence of the **Malkangiri district by backwaters due to the Polavaram project**, the Odisha State government in the year 2016 submitted to the **NCST** that the project was going to submerge 7,656 hectares of land, including forestland, and displace more than 6,800 people including 5,916 tribals in Malkangiri.

The Ministry of Jal Shakti said that as per the Water Resource Department of Andhra Pradesh, by providing remedial measures such as constructing protective embankments for a length of 30 kms along **Sileru and Sabari River in Odisha**, and 29.12 km along **Sabari River in Chhattisgarh**, the submergence in both Odisha and Chhattisgarh could be avoided completely. In August this year, the Ministry had asked the **State Pollution Control Boards** of Odisha and Chhattisgarh to conduct a public hearing for the construction of protective embankments without further loss of time as the project is in an advanced stage of construction. The Odisha State Pollution Control Board is yet to hold a public hearing. The Odisha government had earlier expressed its reservation over the high protective embankment saying it was not feasible. “The construction of an embankment requires the diversion of forestland and creates flooding in Odisha territory.”

The **Polavaram project** is a major multi-purpose irrigation and power generation project located in the **West Godavari district** of **Andhra Pradesh**, India, on the **Godavari River**. It is intended to provide irrigation, drinking water, and flood control to several regions in Andhra Pradesh and neighboring states. The project was initially conceived in the 1940s and has faced a long history of construction delays, legal challenges, and environmental concerns.

### **Objectives of the Polavaram Project**
1. **Irrigation**: The primary purpose of the project is to provide irrigation to the arid regions of Andhra Pradesh, particularly in the **Krishna, Guntur, and West Godavari** districts. It aims to irrigate around 2.91 million acres of farmland.
  
2. **Drinking Water Supply**: The project is designed to provide drinking water to the cities of **Visakhapatnam** and surrounding areas, as well as water to industrial and agricultural zones.

3. **Hydropower Generation**: The Polavaram project includes a hydropower component, with an installed capacity of around 960 MW. It will help meet the power needs of Andhra Pradesh and nearby states.

4. **Flood Control**: One of the main benefits of the project is flood control, especially in the low-lying regions of the Godavari basin, which are prone to seasonal flooding.

### **Key Features**
- **Dam Structure**: The Polavaram project features a **main dam** with a height of 150 feet (46 meters) and a length of about 1,000 meters. It will have a **reservoir** that stores water from the Godavari River.
  
- **Canals and Spillways**: A series of canals will carry the water to different regions for irrigation. The spillway will allow excess water to flow downstream during times of heavy rainfall.

- **Hydropower Plant**: The project will generate electricity by harnessing the water flow, contributing to power generation for the region.

### **Controversies and Opposition**
While the Polavaram project has the potential to significantly boost the region’s development, it has sparked controversy due to several issues:

1. **Environmental Concerns**: The project could submerge large tracts of **forest land** and **tribal villages**. This raises concerns about ecological damage, deforestation, and the loss of biodiversity.

2. **Displacement of People**: The project’s construction will displace thousands of people, particularly from tribal communities. There are concerns over proper rehabilitation and compensation for the displaced people.

3. **Water Sharing Disputes**: The project involves inter-state water sharing, and neighboring states, particularly **Odisha** and **Chhattisgarh**, have raised objections about the potential reduction in water flow to their regions.

4. **Cost and Delays**: The project has faced significant cost overruns and delays, leading to debates over its economic viability. It has been criticized for its slow pace of completion and the allocation of funds.

5. **Legal and Political Challenges**: Several legal challenges and protests from local communities, environmental groups, and political parties have delayed the project. Particularly, **Odisha** has been vocal in opposing the project due to concerns about submerging land in its state.

### **Current Status**
As of now, the project is under **construction** and has received a significant amount of central government funding. The **National Waterway Authority** and various central bodies are involved in its execution, but the project still faces challenges related to clearance, resettlement, and legal disputes.

### **Conclusion**
The Polavaram project is a crucial infrastructure initiative for the region, providing benefits such as irrigation, drinking water, flood control, and power generation. However, it remains contentious due to its environmental impact, potential for displacement, and inter-state disputes. The success of the project depends on resolving these challenges and ensuring that the affected communities are adequately compensated and rehabilitated.

The **Sileru** and **Sabari** rivers are two significant rivers in the eastern part of India, particularly in the state of **Odisha** and the neighboring state of **Andhra Pradesh**. Both rivers are part of the larger **Godavari River basin**, which plays a crucial role in the water supply, agriculture, and ecology of the region. Below is an explanation of both rivers:

### **Sileru River**
- The **Sileru River** is a major tributary of the **Godavari River**, originating in the **Eastern Ghats** in the state of **Odisha** and flowing through the **Koraput** district before entering **Andhra Pradesh**.
  
- **Geography**: The river primarily flows through the dense forests of the Eastern Ghats, and its path traverses both Odisha and Andhra Pradesh. The Sileru River is known for its hilly terrain and the scenic beauty of its course through the Eastern Ghats.

- **Importance**: The river is essential for irrigation purposes in both Odisha and Andhra Pradesh. It also contributes to the Godavari River, which is crucial for water resources in the region.

- **Hydroelectric Projects**: The **Sileru** River has been harnessed for hydroelectric power generation, with the **Sileru Hydroelectric Power Station** being one of the key power stations in the area. This station generates electricity, helping in meeting the energy demands of the region.

- **Environmental Significance**: The Sileru River flows through forested and tribal areas, and it has ecological importance in maintaining biodiversity in the region.

### **Sabari River**
- The **Sabari River** is another important tributary of the **Godavari River** that flows primarily through the **Odisha**-**Andhra Pradesh** border.
  
- **Geography**: The Sabari River originates in the **Eastern Ghats** in Odisha, in the **Malkangiri district**, and flows through Odisha into Andhra Pradesh before it joins the Godavari River. The river is approximately 200 kilometers long.

- **Significance**: The Sabari River holds cultural and agricultural significance in the regions it flows through. It provides water for irrigation to the tribal areas of Odisha, particularly in **Malkangiri** and surrounding districts. In Andhra Pradesh, it also supports agriculture and contributes to the Godavari system.

- **Historical and Cultural Importance**: The Sabari River is also known for its association with Hindu mythology. According to legend, the river is linked to the story of **Sabari**, a devotee of Lord Rama in the **Ramayana**.

- **Ecological and Economic Role**: The river contributes to local agriculture, providing irrigation during the dry season. It also supports various local communities, especially tribal populations, who rely on the river for water and livelihood.

### **Issues and Challenges**
- **Water Sharing Disputes**: Like many other rivers in the region, the Sileru and Sabari rivers face issues of inter-state water sharing between Odisha and Andhra Pradesh. Both states have concerns over water allocation and its impact on agricultural activities and livelihoods.
  
- **Environmental Concerns**: The rivers flow through ecologically sensitive areas, including tribal regions and forests. Any large-scale developmental activities, such as dams, irrigation projects, or deforestation, could have negative effects on the river’s ecology and the local communities.

- **Hydroelectric Power Generation**: While hydroelectric projects on the Sileru and Sabari rivers provide significant energy resources, there are concerns over their environmental impact, especially on local flora and fauna. Additionally, the construction of dams may affect water flow, fishing activities, and agricultural water availability for downstream areas.

### **Conclusion**
Both the Sileru and Sabari rivers are important water sources in Odisha and Andhra Pradesh, contributing to agriculture, hydroelectric power generation, and the livelihoods of local communities. However, their management and use must carefully balance environmental, social, and economic interests to ensure sustainable development. The ongoing challenges related to water sharing and environmental preservation will require cooperation between the states involved, as well as comprehensive planning to mitigate potential conflicts and adverse impacts.

Water disputes between Indian states have been a recurrent issue, often arising due to the unequal distribution of water resources, agricultural dependencies, and economic needs. The Indian Constitution contains provisions that address water disputes, and over the years, several mechanisms and legal frameworks have been set up to resolve them.

### **Relevant Constitutional Provisions for Water Disputes**

1. **Article 262** – **Adjudication of disputes relating to waters of inter-State rivers or river valleys**:
   - This is the key provision in the Constitution concerning water disputes.
   - **Article 262(1)** empowers the Parliament to enact laws for the adjudication of disputes related to the waters of inter-state rivers or river valleys. Parliament can create a legal framework to settle disputes over the sharing of water.
   - **Article 262(2)** states that the Supreme Court shall not have jurisdiction over water disputes, as Parliament can provide for the establishment of a Tribunal to resolve such disputes.
   
   This article is the constitutional basis for the establishment of **Inter-State Water Disputes Tribunals** (ISWDTs).

2. **Entry 56 of the Union List (Seventh Schedule)**:
   - This entry refers to "Regulation and development of inter-State rivers and river valleys" and gives the central government the power to take necessary actions related to the regulation and management of inter-state rivers.

### **Mechanisms for Resolving Water Disputes**

1. **Inter-State Water Disputes Tribunal (ISWDT)**:
   - Under **Article 262**, the **Inter-State River Water Disputes Act, 1956** was enacted to provide a framework for adjudicating disputes related to inter-state rivers.
   - A Tribunal can be constituted by the central government under this Act when a dispute arises between two or more states regarding the sharing of water from an inter-state river or river valley.
   - The Tribunal consists of members with legal and technical expertise, including retired judges, engineers, and other experts. The Tribunal examines the facts, hears arguments, and makes a binding decision on the distribution of water.
   - **Example**: The **Kaveri Water Dispute Tribunal** and the **Narmada Water Dispute Tribunal** are examples of ISWDs formed to resolve water disputes between states.

2. **National Water Policy (NWP)**:
   - The **National Water Policy**, formulated by the **Government of India**, guides the management and utilization of water resources in India. It encourages the equitable distribution of water and suggests solutions for conflict resolution.
   - The policy emphasizes the need for cooperative efforts, inter-state agreements, and efficient water management techniques to reduce the chances of disputes.

3. **State Water Resources Ministries**:
   - Each state has its own water resources ministry or department that is responsible for the utilization, regulation, and conservation of water. These ministries can negotiate agreements or act as facilitators in resolving inter-state water disputes at the local level before escalating to tribunals.

4. **Mediation by Central Government**:
   - In some cases, the central government may step in to mediate between states to avoid prolonged disputes. It can facilitate dialogue and encourage states to come to a mutual agreement before initiating formal adjudication.

### **Recent Developments and Amendments**
1. **The Inter-State River Water Disputes (Amendment) Bill, 2019**:
   - The bill was introduced to make the process of resolving inter-state river water disputes more efficient. Key provisions included setting up a **permanent tribunal** for quicker resolution of water disputes and giving it powers to adjudicate disputes in a time-bound manner.
   - The bill also proposed the creation of a **water management authority** for better coordination between states.
   
2. **Recommendations for Improved Mechanisms**:
   - **Time-bound decision-making**: Current tribunals take years or even decades to resolve disputes, such as the Kaveri dispute (over 20 years). To speed up adjudication, time frames need to be set for the Tribunals to make decisions.
   - **Central Water Regulatory Authority**: A central authority could ensure better management of water resources and help prevent conflicts by promoting cooperative use and regulation across states.
   - **Cooperative Agreements**: States should focus on cooperative agreements that address long-term water needs and include mechanisms for regular review and renegotiation.
   - **Data Transparency and Sharing**: Ensuring transparency in water usage data among states and providing open access to water-sharing records could prevent misunderstandings and disputes.

### **Challenges in Resolving Water Disputes**

1. **Political Factors**: Water disputes often become highly politicized. Political agendas and state-level interests complicate the resolution process, especially when water scarcity becomes a significant electoral issue.
  
2. **Changing Climate**: Water scarcity is exacerbated by climate change. Changes in rainfall patterns, droughts, and water availability further increase tension between states sharing river resources.

3. **Inefficient Water Management**: Many states fail to use water efficiently or lack advanced technologies for irrigation, exacerbating the shortage of water resources. This leads to disputes when neighboring states claim the right to use more water.

4. **Lack of Will for Compromise**: States often resist compromising on water sharing, believing that giving up control over water resources will lead to economic loss. This makes reaching a long-term solution challenging.

### **Conclusion**
To resolve inter-state water disputes effectively, there is a need for stronger legal and institutional frameworks, timely adjudication, transparent data sharing, and cooperative agreements between states. The role of the central government in facilitating dialogue and creating conditions for equitable and sustainable water management is critical. Additionally, creating a permanent water dispute tribunal and enforcing water conservation measures will help in minimizing future disputes.

> The **BJD (Biju Janata Dal)** is opposing the **Polavaram project** due to concerns over its potential impact on the state of **Odisha**. The project, located in Andhra Pradesh, involves the construction of a large dam on the Godavari River, which is expected to submerge significant areas of land in Odisha, particularly affecting tribal communities and their livelihoods. The BJD argues that the project could lead to the displacement of people, destruction of forests, and loss of agricultural land. Additionally, they claim that Odisha's interests were not adequately considered during the planning and approval process.

# How would a carbon market function?

**COP29**, the ongoing climate conference in **Azerbaijan’s capital Baku**, has given a fillip to the idea of using carbon markets to curb carbon emissions by approving standards that can help in the setting up of an international carbon market as soon as the coming year.

### What is a carbon market?

A carbon market is a market that allows the buying and selling of the right to emit carbon into the atmosphere. Suppose a government wants to limit the amount of carbon emitted into the atmosphere. It can issue certificates called carbon credits that allow the holder of the certificate to emit a certain amount of carbon into the atmosphere. One carbon credit is equivalent to 1,000 kilograms of carbon dioxide. By limiting the number of carbon credits that are issued, governments can control how much carbon is released into the environment. It should be noted that anyone who doesn’t hold carbon credits to their name would not be allowed to emit any carbon into the atmosphere. Carbon credits were first used in the 1990s in the U.S., which introduced the cap-and-trade model to control the emission of sulphur dioxide.

Individuals and firms that hold carbon credits but don’t actually need them for any reason can sell their credits to interested buyers. The price at which these carbon credits are traded is determined by market forces, which in this case are the supply of carbon credits and the demand for these certificates. A carbon market can also include the trading of carbon offsets. In this case, a business that pollutes the environment for example, can purchase carbon offsets sold by an environmental NGO that promises to plant trees that suck a certain amount of carbon emissions out of the atmosphere for each offset that it sells.

### What is good about carbon markets?

Pollution of the environment and climate change caused by carbon emissions is a classic case of what economists call an externality. An externality is caused when the cost of an economic activity is not properly accounted for (or internalised) by the market price system due to the absence of well-defined property rights. For example, a business that uses raw materials such as iron will have to pay the supplier who owns the iron to be able to procure and use it, thus incurring a certain cost. But when the same firm emits carbon into the atmosphere, it doesn’t usually have to pay any money to anyone. In other words, firms are generally able to emit their waste into the atmosphere for free. This of course leads to unhindered pollution of the atmosphere as firms in this case have no financial incentive to curb their carbon emissions. Carbon markets in which the right to pollute is traded for a price can solve the problem by imposing a certain cost on firms for polluting the atmosphere, helping to curb emissions in the process.

The intersection of standardised accounting frameworks and technological advancements has improved the ability of corporations to monitor and report their carbon emissions. While, this is difficult for the vast majority of small businesses in the developing world, particularly in accurately capturing supply chain emissions, ongoing developments, like real-time data tracking of the energy sector, continue to enhance the granularity and reliability of corporate carbon accounting. However, corporations have preferred a voluntary reporting system, like the Carbon Disclosure Project. They have been loathe to government interventions limiting carbon emissions, arguing that such budgeting may lead to output restrictions or rise in costs. They also point to varied production processes, some that might have diverse supply chains that might make it difficult to find the optimal carbon budget for their facilities. Large multinational corporations such as ExxonMobil and General Motors have advocated for carbon markets that allows free trading of carbon credits among firms at a price determined by market forces, that would allow these firms to purchase carbon credits from other firms, which don’t need them as much. This they say, helps allocate carbon credits more efficiently than government diktat.

### What can go wrong?

Even when there is a functioning carbon market, a government that is not very keen on reducing emissions may increase the supply of carbon credits and drive down the price of the right to pollute, leading to no noticeable drop in emissions. Others may keep a strict cap on the supply of carbon credits but allow firms to cheat by allowing them to illegally emit carbon. The success of carbon offsets also depends on the degree of personal incentive that firm owners possess to care about carbon emissions, which may often be very little. Critics claim that firms that purchase carbon offsets often do it for the sake of virtue signalling and may have little incentive to ensure that their investments in these instruments are actually helping offset carbon emissions. Meanwhile, other critics have raised more fundamental questions regarding how exactly a government would be able to arrive at the optimum supply of carbon credits. They argue that politicians, who do not incur any personal economic cost when they legislate emission reductions, may restrict the supply of carbon credits more than what is really necessary, leading to slower economic growth.

> A **carbon market** is a system where carbon emissions are traded as a commodity. It operates on the principle of **cap-and-trade** or **carbon offset** systems. In a cap-and-trade system, a government sets a limit (cap) on total emissions, and companies are allocated permits for a certain amount of emissions. Companies that reduce their emissions can sell surplus permits, while those exceeding their limits must buy additional permits. **Carbon offset** involves funding projects that reduce or remove emissions elsewhere. This creates a financial incentive for companies to lower emissions and invest in cleaner technologies, contributing to climate change mitigation.

# Black holes

### **Black Holes: A Complete Explanation**

A **black hole** is an astronomical object with an extremely strong gravitational pull that nothing, not even light, can escape from it. This phenomenon occurs when a massive star collapses under its own gravity, compressing all its matter into an infinitely small space, creating a singularity. The boundary around a black hole is known as the **event horizon**. Beyond this point, nothing can escape the black hole’s pull.

### **Formation of a Black Hole**
Black holes typically form from the remnants of massive stars that undergo a process called **stellar collapse**. When a star uses up its nuclear fuel, the outward pressure exerted by nuclear fusion in its core decreases, and the star's core starts to collapse under its gravity. If the core's mass is large enough (about 3 times the mass of the Sun), it will continue collapsing into a singularity, creating a black hole. The size and mass of the resulting black hole depend on the mass of the original star.

### **Parts of a Black Hole**
1. **Singularity**:  
   At the very center of a black hole is the singularity, a point where matter is compressed to an infinite density. In this region, the gravitational forces are so intense that the fabric of space-time curves infinitely. The laws of physics as we understand them break down here.

2. **Event Horizon**:  
   The event horizon is the boundary that marks the point of no return for anything approaching the black hole. Once something crosses the event horizon, it is irrevocably pulled towards the singularity. Light, which travels at the fastest possible speed, cannot escape past this boundary, which is why black holes are "black."

3. **Accretion Disk**:  
   This is a rotating disk of matter (such as gas, dust, and debris) that spirals towards the black hole. As matter gets closer to the event horizon, it heats up and emits radiation, often in the form of X-rays, making black holes detectable by telescopes. The accretion disk is formed as matter is attracted by the black hole’s gravity.

### **Types of Black Holes**
1. **Stellar Black Holes**:  
   These are the most common type of black holes, formed from the remnants of large stars that have gone through supernova explosions. Their masses typically range from a few solar masses to several tens of solar masses.

2. **Supermassive Black Holes**:  
   These reside at the centers of most galaxies, including our own Milky Way. Supermassive black holes have millions to billions of times the mass of the Sun. Their formation mechanisms are still not fully understood, but they are thought to have grown over billions of years by merging with other black holes or by accreting large amounts of matter.

3. **Intermediate Black Holes**:  
   These black holes have masses ranging between stellar and supermassive black holes. They are harder to detect because they are smaller than supermassive black holes but larger than stellar black holes. Evidence of their existence is still being gathered.

4. **Primordial Black Holes**:  
   These hypothetical black holes could have formed in the early universe, possibly due to high-density fluctuations during the Big Bang. If they exist, they could be much smaller than stellar black holes.

### **Characteristics of Black Holes**
- **Gravitational Time Dilation**:  
   Due to the intense gravitational field near a black hole, time appears to slow down as an object approaches the event horizon. This effect, predicted by Einstein's theory of relativity, has been confirmed experimentally.
   
- **Spaghettification**:  
   As an object moves closer to a black hole, the difference in gravitational pull between the object’s nearer and farther sides becomes extreme, stretching it into a long, thin shape, often referred to as "spaghettification."

### **Detection of Black Holes**
While black holes do not emit light, they can be detected through their interaction with nearby matter. Observing the effect of their gravity on surrounding stars or gas can help astronomers identify their presence. **Gravitational waves**, ripples in space-time caused by massive objects like black holes colliding, are another way black holes are detected.

### **Black Hole Information Paradox**
One of the most famous questions in physics is the **black hole information paradox**, which arises from the fact that anything falling into a black hole seems to be lost forever. According to quantum mechanics, information about the physical state of matter should not be lost, but it is unclear whether this is true for black holes. This paradox is an active area of research in theoretical physics.

### **Conclusion**
Black holes are some of the most fascinating and mysterious objects in the universe. They challenge our understanding of physics, particularly at the intersection of general relativity and quantum mechanics. Despite their extreme nature, black holes play a crucial role in the dynamics of galaxies and the universe. Continued research into black holes, including the study of gravitational waves and advanced observational techniques, will likely reveal more about their nature and the fundamental laws of the universe.

> A **black hole** is an astronomical object with an intense gravitational pull, where not even light can escape. It forms when a massive star collapses under its own gravity, creating a singularity at the center. The boundary of a black hole, called the **event horizon**, marks the point beyond which nothing can return. Black holes come in various types, including **stellar**, **supermassive**, and **intermediate**, each with different sizes and formation processes. They are detected through their effects on nearby matter, such as the **accretion disk** and **gravitational waves**. Black holes challenge our understanding of physics, particularly regarding the **information paradox**.

# Let’s talk about ‘one candidate, multiple constituencies’

Ever since the panel for ‘One Nation One Election’ led by the former President of India, Ram Nath Kovind, recommended simultaneous elections to the Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies, much has been written on its positive and negative aspects, the practical considerations and of course the politics around the subject. Amidst all the political accusations and counter-accusations, another important issue has gone missing from attention. The matter is about one candidate contesting from multiple constituencies (OCMC) for the same office.

### The background, the challenges

The Constitution of India provides for regular elections every five years to the Legislative Assembly and the lower House of Parliament. However, the Constitution, other than providing for the Election Commission of India (ECI), has empowered Parliament to regulate the manner of conducting the elections. Therefore, ‘contesting from multiple constituencies’ has been dealt with in the Representation of the People Act 1951. Under the Act, there was no limit on the number of constituencies a candidate could contest — until 1996. This resulted in candidates contesting from multiple constituencies, sometimes more than two, winning them and vacating all but one seat, in accordance with Section 70 of the same Act. This necessitated by-elections frequently.

Due to this, Parliament amended the Act in 1996 to limit the number of constituencies that a candidate can contest from, to two. The amendment intended to discourage one candidate from contesting from multiple constituencies. Despite this, the practice has continued. The numbers are even more frequent in State Legislative Assembly elections, leading to frequent by-elections — there were 44 by-elections for State Assemblies in November 2024 due to the resignation of sitting legislators.

Frequent by-elections due to candidates winning from multiple constituencies pose several challenges. First, they add to taxpayer costs. The administrative cost of the Lok Sabha elections is borne by the central government, and Legislative Assemblies by the State governments; in the 2014 general election, it amounted to ₹3,870 crore. Adjusted for 6% annual inflation, the 2024 general election is put at a cost of ₹6,931 crore, or ₹12.76 crore per seat. If 10 politicians win from two constituencies, the extra cost of holding a by-election would be around ₹130 crore. While this is relatively small when compared to overall election spending, the real issue lies in the massive expenditure by political parties, estimated at ₹1,35,000 crore for the recent general election, or about ₹250 crore per constituency, according to the estimates by the Centre for Media Studies. This burden ultimately falls on the public, and much of the funding comes from black money, which undermines financial transparency.

Second, the by-election necessitated by the vacation of a winning candidate within an initial six months tends to favour the ruling party. This is borne out in by-election trends across multiple States. This emanates from the fact the ruling party can mobilise resources and provide patronage to party workers. Such a scenario of a non-level playing field is skewed against the Opposition, which has negative implications for parliamentary democracy.

Third, the financial burden of organising a by-election disproportionately falls on the already defeated candidate and their party, forcing them to spend resources once again.

Fourth, the saying “Democracy is a government of the people, by the people, and for the people” suggests that elections should serve people’s needs. However, a candidate contesting from multiple seats serves as a hedging mechanism against uncertainties and often prioritises the leader’s interests, not the people’s. This undermines democratic principles, placing politics above the public.

Fifth, OCMC is sometimes used to enhance the reach and message delivery of the leader, relying on their popularity for electoral success. This often reflects the leader’s dominance within the party, particularly in family- or leader-centric parties. Moreover, OCMC goes against the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression of citizens. A petition filed in 2023 (Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay vs Union of India) argued that when people elect a representative, they trust that person to be their voice. Contesting multiple constituencies, winning them, and vacating one for a by-election violates Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. This practice causes voter confusion and discontent, as seen in Wayanad, Kerala, when Rahul Gandhi vacated his seat in 2024, potentially leading to voter apathy. The voter turnout was 64.24% in the bypoll and 72.92% in the general election.

### Some advantages

The OCMC is common in many countries. It may also have some practical considerations. First, contesting multiple seats provides a safety net for candidates, especially in tightly contested constituencies. Second, in a polity such as India, where politics is centered around the leader and family, OCMC smoothens the leader’s continuation or transition in case a leader-centric party secures a majority in the elections but the leader of the party loses out. For instance, Mamata Banerjee lost the Nandigram seat in the 2021 West Bengal Assembly elections. To make way for her, another leader elected from the Bhabanipur constituency had to resign from the Assembly. Similar things unfolded in the case of Pushkar Singh Dhami, Chief Minister of Uttarakhand in the 2022 Assembly elections.

### International experience

OCMC is not unique to India. Pakistan and Bangladesh allow candidates to contest multiple constituencies but require them to relinquish all but one seat. Pakistan places no limit on the number of constituencies a candidate can contest, as seen in the 2018 elections when the former Prime Minister contested five seats and vacated four. Similarly, Bangladesh allowed candidates to contest up to five constituencies until 2008 but now limits it to three. The practice was once common in the United Kingdom but has been banned since 1983. Most European democracies have phased it out to promote clear representation and accountability.

The misuse of the OCMC far outweighs the benefits. There have been demands for reforms, and probable solutions may be considered. First, amend Section 33(7) of the RP Act 1951 to ban one candidate contesting from multiple constituencies for the same office. The ECI, in 2004, recommended the government ban the practice. The 255th Law Commission report in 2015 made the same recommendation.

Second, recovering the full cost of by-elections from the candidate vacating a seat can serve to discourage candidates from contesting simultaneously. The ECI recommended cost imposition on candidates contesting from multiple constituencies in 2004. However, the practice of OCMC will continue as the winning candidate or political party can afford to pay the cost.

Third, a more effective deterrent would be to hold the by-elections after a year, allowing voters ample time to make an informed decision and giving the defeated candidate sufficient time to recover and prepare strategically for another contest. This would also provide a more balanced and fair electoral process. This could be done by amending Section 151A, Representation of Peoples Act 1951 which provides for by-election within six months of the occurrence of vacancy.

Holding elections requires substantial financial resources from the state. Furthermore, with elections being a round-the-year affair in India, the frequent need for by-elections takes time and money — resources that could otherwise be better invested in the country’s development. However, as the issue of OCOC (one candidate, one constituency) is political, it requires political willpower and the support of the major parties to bring about change. However, unlike the One Nation One Election, it does not have many proponents in political parties. If **“one person, one vote”** is the core democratic principle for voters, it is time to enforce **“one candidate, one constituency”** for candidates.

> The concept of **'one candidate, multiple constituencies'** refers to a situation where a political candidate contests elections in more than one constituency. While candidates may win multiple seats, they are legally required to vacate all but one, leading to by-elections. This practice has faced criticism for promoting opportunism, misuse of resources, and undermining the democratic process. It also raises concerns about fairness, as wealthy or influential candidates can manipulate the system. Some reforms, including the **Representation of the People (Amendment) Bill**, aim to address this issue by disqualifying candidates who contest multiple constituencies, ensuring more meaningful elections.

# Centre launches Jalvahak scheme for cargo movement via inland waterways

### **Jalvahak Scheme: Boosting Cargo Movement via Inland Waterways**

On Sunday, the **Indian Government** launched the **Jalvahak Scheme**, an initiative aimed at promoting and incentivizing the movement of cargo via inland waterways. This scheme is part of a broader effort to enhance the efficiency and sustainability of India’s transport infrastructure, especially focusing on long-haul cargo movement across National Waterways (NW).

The Jalvahak Scheme is designed to encourage the use of India’s vast network of rivers and inland waterways, which have traditionally been underutilized for cargo transportation. By making water transport more viable, the scheme aims to ease congestion on road and rail networks while offering a cleaner, more fuel-efficient alternative.

### **National Waterways Included in the Scheme**
The scheme primarily targets **National Waterways 1 (NW-1)**, **National Waterways 2 (NW-2)**, and **National Waterways 16 (NW-16)**. These waterways connect crucial regions in India and have the potential to significantly reduce the cost and time required for long-distance cargo transportation.

1. **National Waterway 1 (Ganga)**: 
   The **Ganga River**, spanning a length of 1,620 km, is one of the most important inland waterways in India. It connects key industrial hubs like **Allahabad, Varanasi, Patna**, and **Kolkata**, providing a vital route for transporting bulk commodities such as coal, cement, and food grains.
   
2. **National Waterway 2 (Brahmaputra)**: 
   The **Brahmaputra River**, running through the northeastern states, is another crucial waterway for cargo transportation. Spanning across 891 km, it connects **Assam** and other northeastern states to the rest of the country, helping transport goods like fertilizers, petroleum, and food products.

3. **National Waterway 16 (Barak)**: 
   The **Barak River** flows through **Assam** and **Manipur**, facilitating trade in the northeastern part of India. The 121 km stretch of this waterway is essential for regional trade, particularly for industries involved in agriculture and local manufacturing.

### **Objectives of the Jalvahak Scheme**
The **Jalvahak Scheme** seeks to make cargo transport via waterways an attractive option by offering incentives to industries and businesses. The key objectives of the scheme are as follows:

1. **Reduction in Freight Costs**:  
   Inland waterways are more fuel-efficient compared to road and rail transport, helping to reduce freight costs. This is particularly beneficial for industries involved in bulk cargo transportation, as water transport can carry larger volumes at a lower cost.

2. **Environmental Benefits**:  
   Waterways are a greener mode of transport compared to road and rail. By incentivizing their use, the Jalvahak Scheme contributes to reducing carbon emissions and promoting sustainable logistics solutions.

3. **Decongestion of Roads and Railways**:  
   By shifting part of the cargo traffic from roads and railways to waterways, the scheme helps ease congestion in urban areas and on overburdened rail corridors, thus improving the efficiency of the overall transport network.

4. **Boost to Regional Trade**:  
   The scheme also supports regional trade, especially in the northeastern states and along the Ganga. The expansion of waterway routes can open up new markets, reduce transportation costs for local businesses, and improve access to national and international trade routes.

5. **Creation of Employment Opportunities**:  
   The development and expansion of inland waterway infrastructure, along with increased shipping activity, is expected to create jobs in sectors such as logistics, shipping, construction, and maintenance.

### **Economic and Strategic Implications**
The Jalvahak Scheme is part of a broader government strategy to develop India’s maritime and inland waterways sector, as outlined in the **Sagarmala Project**, which aims to boost port connectivity, reduce logistics costs, and make Indian ports competitive globally. The scheme not only holds promise for economic growth but also for strengthening **India’s trade connectivity** with neighboring countries in Southeast Asia and Bangladesh.

By incentivizing the use of inland waterways for cargo transport, the Jalvahak Scheme presents an opportunity for India to capitalize on its geographical advantages, especially the **Ganga-Brahmaputra Delta**, which offers a natural route for large-scale transport. 

Moreover, India’s focus on inland waterways aligns with the **World Trade Organization's** principles of improving **global logistics networks** and **regional connectivity**. Efficient cargo movement via waterways also positions India as a regional leader in facilitating cross-border trade in South Asia.

### **Conclusion**
The **Jalvahak Scheme** is a significant step toward modernizing India’s transportation infrastructure. By promoting the use of inland waterways for long-haul cargo movement, the scheme aims to reduce logistics costs, improve sustainability, and enhance economic growth. With its focus on reducing road congestion and enhancing regional trade, the scheme has the potential to transform India’s logistics and transportation sector, especially in regions like the northeast, where water transport is critical. Through strategic implementation, the Jalvahak Scheme could become a cornerstone of India’s broader efforts to boost economic development and sustainability.

# The digital frontier of inequality

India stands at a pivotal moment in its digital revolution, underpinned by an internationally recognised model of digital public infrastructure. Today, India has **1.18 billion mobile connections, 700 million Internet users, and 600 million smartphones.**

While the narrowing of the digital gender divide is a sign of progress, as in many countries, a surge in **gender-based violence (GBV)**, particularly tech-facilitated GBV, threatens to overshadow gains. In response, the Union Ministry of Women and Child Development recently launched **‘Ab Koi Bahana Nahi (no more excuses)’**, a national campaign aligned with the global ‘16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence’. This annual campaign is led by **UN Women**.

### The risks

India’s digital transformation has unlocked immense opportunities for empowerment. The **Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana** has increased account coverage almost four-fold since 2015, with women holding 55.6% of the accounts. Digital Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-mobile linkages enable direct benefits and cashless transactions, especially in rural areas. However, this increased connectivity has also exposed women to new risks.

In urban areas, online harassment is rampant, particularly targeting women in public-facing roles such as journalists and politicians. Rural India boasts 20% more Internet users than in urban areas (2021 Nielsen report). Already constrained by societal norms, many women and girls lack the digital literacy and skills to navigate online spaces safely. Compounding the issue, many women are also unaware of their rights or the mechanisms available to them for reporting abuse.

TFGBV takes many harmful forms. These include persistent harassment such as cyberstalking, online trolling, and the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. Impersonation and fraud through fake profiles, voyeurism, and grooming further exploit vulnerable individuals. These often force women and girls to retreat from digital spaces.

India has taken important steps to combat TFGBV. Legal protections, including the **Information Technology Act, 2000, and the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2024**, provide a strong foundation to address digital violence. Mechanisms such as the **National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal** enable anonymous reporting, while the government-led **Information Security Education and Awareness Programme** spreads digital safety awareness. Women-specific programmes, such as **Digital Shakti,** launched by the **National Commission for Women**, equip women with tools to navigate online spaces securely. These measures mark great progress in creating safer digital spaces, though some gaps remain.

India also actively engages in international negotiations and agreements, including the **67th Session of the Commission on the Status of Women** where UN member states, including India, signed off on agreed conclusions that called for **“adequate safeguards in order to promote an open, secure, stable, accessible and affordable information and communications technology environment for all women and girls”**. This underscores India’s commitment to tackling TFGBV.

### The way forward

Achieving truly safe digital environments for women and girls requires more focused and strategic efforts that can keep pace with this changing and evolving digital world.

The **Global Digital Compact**, adopted by world leaders including India, at the UN Summit of the Future earlier this year, further strengthens legal and policy frameworks “to counter and eliminate all forms of violence, including sexual and gender-based violence that occurs through or is amplified by the use of technology”. Therefore, combating TFGBV must be a top priority. This includes enforcing **stricter laws** against perpetrators of online violence, and swifter justice for survivors. Holding social media platforms accountable is an important part of the tool kit to reduce TFGBV.

**Expanding digital literacy programmes**, particularly in rural areas, is critical. Integrating **safe online practices into school curriculums** and conducting community workshops for women and men, young and old, can be empowering. Additionally, nationwide campaigns that challenge societal norms and actively engage men and boys as allies can foster respectful and inclusive digital spaces.

Collaboration with India’s vibrant tech industry is essential. While many platforms have introduced safety features, these need further enhancement to proactively address online abuse. Leveraging artificial intelligence to detect and remove abusive content, yet retaining human oversight, alongside introducing user-friendly reporting mechanisms, can improve safety.

Just as important is the development of robust survivor support systems that offer accessible counselling, legal aid, and rehabilitation services. Expanding the capacity of helplines and initiatives such as TechSakhi, a helpline offering accurate information, empathetic support, and assistance, will ensure that survivors receive timely and effective assistance.

As we concluded observing the 16-Days of Activism that ends on International Human Rights Day every year, India’s timely message is unequivocal: **Ab Koi Bahana Nahi**. Ensuring women’s safety online is not only a moral obligation but also a critical pillar for India’s progress.

Governments, tech companies, civil society groups, individuals, and international organisations have a role to play, and we in the UN Country Team are proud to be a partner in this journey.

> **The digital frontier of inequality** refers to the growing divide between those who have access to digital technologies and those who do not. This divide exacerbates social and economic inequalities, limiting access to education, healthcare, and employment opportunities for marginalized communities, particularly in rural and underserved regions. With the increasing reliance on digital platforms, individuals without internet access or digital skills are at a disadvantage. Bridging this digital divide requires investments in infrastructure, digital literacy, and affordable technology to ensure equal participation in the digital economy, fostering greater inclusion and reducing disparities across society.

# India’s firmer attempts at mineral diplomacy

As India seeks to expand its manufacturing and technological capability, critical minerals will become vital to fulfil this ambition. However, India, a major critical mineral importer, still depends on other countries, primarily China, for its mineral security, which has become a cause of strategic concern. Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, who voiced India’s apprehensions at a defence think tank gathering, said, “While [the] scramble for resources for economic reasons has had a long history, their weaponisation by some nations for strategic reasons is a comparatively new phenomenon”, hinting at Chinese attempts. To address India’s mineral security challenge, which is aimed at reducing its strategic vulnerability, New Delhi has started an attempt to engage in mineral diplomacy.

### Establishing joint ventures

This attempt is based on the pillars of: developing international engagement with mineral-producing countries, and establishing strategic partnerships with intergovernmental organisations. The first pillar focuses on building bilateral ties with resource-rich countries such as Australia, Argentina, the United States, Russia, and Kazakhstan to secure the supply of lithium and cobalt. To facilitate this vision, post-2019, India established the Khanij Bidesh India Ltd. (KABIL), a joint venture company with a mandate “to ensure a consistent supply of critical and strategic minerals to the Indian domestic market”. The objective was to achieve mineral security by securing agreements, and acquisitions through government-to-government, government-to-business, and business-to-business routes.

In March 2022, KABIL signed a Memorandum of understanding with Australia for a critical mineral investment partnership, identifying two lithium and three cobalt projects. Latin America’s Lithium Triangle, which constitutes Argentina, Chile, and Bolivia, has also attracted India’s attention. In January 2024, India signed a $24 million lithium exploration pact with a state-owned enterprise in Argentina for five lithium brine blocks. KABIL is also actively working to secure mineral supplies by facilitating the buying of assets from Bolivia and Chile. Apart from the government, India’s private sector has also benefited. Altmin Private Limited signed an agreement with YLB, Bolivia’s national company, to secure the raw material supply chain of Li-ion batteries.

Central Asia has also caught India’s attention. Recently, India and Kazakhstan formed a joint venture, IREUK Titanium Limited, to produce titanium slag in India. This was one of India’s first joint ventures with the Central Asian Republics. This attempt is aligned with New Delhi’s proposal to establish an India-Central Asia Rare Earths Forum to leverage the region’s rich resources.

### Cooperative engagements

The second pillar of mineral diplomacy is international engagement, which is forging and strengthening partnerships with minilateral and multilateral initiatives related to mineral security, such as the Quad (Australia, Japan, India, the United States), the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF), Mineral Security Partnership (MSP) and the G-7, for cooperation in the critical mineral supply chain. These cooperative engagements aim to align India with the global best practices in the critical mineral sector across its three segments — upstream, midstream, and downstream.

Additionally, they also facilitate knowledge sharing and capacity building, which is important for coordinating with international partners such as the U.S., the European Union (EU), South Korea, and Australia.

To further this collaboration with western partners, India’s Ministry of Mines signed a MoU with the International Energy Agency to strengthen cooperation on critical minerals, helping India to “streamline its policies, regulations, and investment strategies in the critical mineral sector, aligning them with global standards and best practices”.

### The missing pieces

India’s attempt at mineral diplomacy has led to many positive outcomes, but still lacks three essential ingredients required for its international diplomatic engagement. These are: a lack of private sector participation; weak diplomatic capacity, and insufficient sustainable partnership. Also, India’s private sector has largely been missing from the equation.

The absence of a critical mineral supply chain strategy and a clear road map for the private sector are two primary variables responsible for the lack of policy clarity, leading to their absenteeism. To address these, India needs to formulate a comprehensive approach for de-risking, considering the role of the private sector across the supply chain. An important step would be to have a supply chain strategy based on India’s growth prospects and national security priorities.

Second, India must strengthen its mineral diplomacy engagement. Having a dedicated mineral diplomacy division within the Ministry of External Affairs, similar to the New and Emerging Strategic Technologies (NEST) division and a special position for mineral diplomacy in selected diplomatic missions can be the first step.

Third, India’s goal towards mineral security necessitates that New Delhi forge strategic, sustainable, and trusted partnerships with bilateral partners and multilateral forums. Among all its partners, working with EU, South Korea, and the other Quad members is critical to India’s mineral security due to its domestic capabilities, diplomatic network and technological know-how. If these issues can be resolved, India’s attempts at mineral diplomacy will gain strength and will be able to better complement New Delhi’s domestic critical mineral initiatives, which are currently moving at a slow pace.

> India’s efforts in **mineral diplomacy** focus on securing access to essential minerals like lithium, cobalt, and rare earth elements, crucial for its growing industries, including electric vehicles and renewable energy. As global competition for these resources intensifies, India is strengthening ties with resource-rich countries, particularly in Africa, Latin America, and Central Asia. Through bilateral agreements, joint ventures, and strategic investments, India aims to reduce dependency on China and other major producers. This proactive approach ensures a stable supply of minerals, bolsters India’s industrial growth, and enhances its geopolitical influence in the global market for critical resources.

# Techie’s death: Wife and family arrested, brought to Bengaluru

### **Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961**  
The **Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961** was enacted to prevent the practice of dowry in India, which involves giving or taking property, money, or valuable items by one party to another as a condition for marriage. 

#### **Key Provisions of the Act**:  
1. **Definition of Dowry**: Any property or valuable security given or agreed to be given directly or indirectly by:
   - One party to another in a marriage.
   - Parents or guardians to either party.  
2. **Penalty for Giving or Taking Dowry**:  
   - Imprisonment of up to 5 years and/or a fine of ₹15,000 or the value of dowry (whichever is higher).  
3. **Ban on Dowry Demand**: Demanding dowry before, during, or after marriage is a punishable offense.  
4. **Dowry Agreements**: Any agreement for dowry is considered void.  
5. **Role of Dowry Prohibition Officers**: Officers are appointed to ensure the law is followed and prevent dowry-related offenses.

---

### **How the Act Helps Women**:  
1. **Prevents Exploitation**: It aims to stop the financial exploitation of women and their families by protecting them from dowry demands.  
2. **Legal Safeguard**: Women can file complaints against in-laws or husbands for harassment related to dowry.  
3. **Discourages Social Evil**: By criminalizing dowry, the Act discourages this harmful practice and promotes gender equality in marriage.  
4. **Promotes Awareness**: The Act raises awareness about women’s rights and creates social pressure to abandon dowry.  

---

### **Misuse of the Act**:  

Despite its benefits, there have been instances where the Dowry Prohibition Act has been misused. In cases like the recent **techie’s death**, where the family of the deceased has been accused of harassment due to dowry demands, concerns arise about misuse.  

#### **How It is Misused**:  
1. **False Allegations**: Some individuals file dowry harassment cases as a means of personal vendetta or to gain an advantage in disputes, particularly marital conflicts.  
2. **Extended Liability**: Entire families, including elderly parents and relatives, are sometimes implicated without concrete evidence.  
3. **Police Action**: Immediate arrests based on complaints without proper investigation can lead to undue harassment of the accused.  
4. **Burden of Proof**: The accused often struggle to prove their innocence due to the presumption of guilt in dowry-related offenses.  

---

### **Case Analysis: Techie’s Death**  
- In the techie’s case, the wife and her family have been accused of misuse of the law, allegedly filing a case to implicate the victim’s family unfairly.  
- **Implication**: Such instances highlight the need for balanced implementation of the law. While genuine cases of dowry harassment must be addressed rigorously, misuse undermines the Act’s credibility and distracts from real victims.  

---

### **Conclusion**  
The Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, is a vital tool to combat dowry-related harassment and deaths, empowering women and promoting equality in marriages. However, its misuse in certain cases calls for reforms such as thorough investigations before arrests, legal safeguards for falsely accused individuals, and promoting alternative dispute resolution mechanisms to prevent misuse while ensuring justice for genuine victims.

> The **Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961** aims to prevent dowry-related exploitation by criminalizing the demand, giving, or taking of dowry. It ensures legal protection for women, preventing financial exploitation and promoting gender equality. However, the Act is sometimes misused in cases where false allegations of dowry harassment are made, often in marital disputes. This can lead to wrongful arrests and undue harassment of accused families, as seen in the recent techie’s death case, where the wife and family were arrested. While the Act helps protect women, its misuse highlights the need for careful investigation and safeguards against false accusations.

# Simultaneous polls Bill not to come up before LS today

### Simultaneous Elections: Comprehensive Overview

**Introduction**  
Simultaneous elections refer to conducting elections for the Lok Sabha (House of the People) and all State Legislative Assemblies simultaneously, instead of holding them at different times. This idea has been proposed to streamline the election process, reduce costs, and bring stability to governance.

---

### **Historical Context**  
1. **Post-Independence Era**: Simultaneous elections were conducted in India in 1952, 1957, 1962, and 1967.  
2. **Divergence**: The dissolution of some State Assemblies in 1968-69 and the Lok Sabha in 1970 disrupted the practice.  
3. **Subsequent Practice**: Elections started occurring frequently due to premature dissolutions, loss of majority, or completion of different terms.

---

### **Recommendations for Simultaneous Elections**  

1. **Law Commission (170th and 255th Reports)**: Suggested steps to bring elections in sync and emphasized constitutional amendments.  
2. **NITI Aayog (2017)**: Proposed a two-phase election schedule to ease the transition:  
   - Phase 1: Hold elections in 2024 for assemblies whose terms end in 2024 and 2025.  
   - Phase 2: Align other states’ elections in 2029 with the Lok Sabha polls.  
3. **Election Commission of India**: Supported the idea but highlighted logistical challenges and legal hurdles.  
4. **Parliamentary Standing Committee on Personnel, Public Grievances, Law, and Justice (2015)**: Advocated for simultaneous elections to enhance governance.

---

### **Constitutional and Legal Framework Required**  
1. **Amendments Needed**:  
   - Articles 83, 85, 172, 174, and 356 of the Constitution to adjust terms of legislatures.  
   - Representation of the People Act, 1951, for procedural alignment.  
2. **Challenges**: Ensuring alignment of election cycles across states and the Lok Sabha.

---

### **Advantages of Simultaneous Elections**  
1. **Reduced Election Expenditure**:  
   - Conducting frequent elections incurs significant costs. Simultaneous polls would save resources for political parties and the Election Commission.  

2. **Administrative Efficiency**:  
   - Frequent elections require heavy deployment of security forces and officials, affecting governance. A unified election would streamline this process.

3. **Minimized Policy Paralysis**:  
   - Model Code of Conduct (MCC), imposed during elections, hampers the government’s ability to announce new schemes. Fewer elections mean lesser disruptions.  

4. **Enhanced Voter Turnout**:  
   - One-time elections might boost participation by consolidating voters’ attention and resources.  

5. **Long-Term Governance Stability**:  
   - Ensures focus on developmental goals without frequent political distractions.  

---

### **Disadvantages of Simultaneous Elections**  
1. **Federal Concerns**:  
   - India’s federal structure provides autonomy to states. Forcing synchronized elections may undermine this autonomy.

2. **Logistical Challenges**:  
   - Requires a massive scale of resources—electronic voting machines (EVMs), personnel, and security forces.

3. **One Nation, One Election Debate**:  
   - May centralize power and blur the distinction between national and state-level issues, potentially sidelining local issues.

4. **Mid-Term Dissolutions**:  
   - Managing assemblies or Lok Sabha dissolutions in the middle of a term poses a constitutional dilemma.

5. **Political Resistance**:  
   - Opposition parties may view it as a strategy to benefit the ruling party at the center.

6. **Voter Fatigue**:  
   - Simultaneous elections may overwhelm voters, reducing their ability to differentiate between national and state issues.

---

### **Implementation Challenges**  
1. **Harmonizing Terms**:  
   - Extending or curtailing the terms of existing legislatures could face political and legal opposition.  
2. **Capacity Building**:  
   - Election infrastructure needs significant upgrades.  
3. **Public Opinion**:  
   - Educating voters and achieving consensus among political parties is crucial.  

---

### **Alternatives Proposed**  
1. **Phased Synchronization**: Aligning elections in two or three phases over a decade.  
2. **Partial Simultaneity**: Conducting regional or zonal elections together to reduce frequency.  
3. **Staggered MCC**: Implementing the Model Code of Conduct only in areas where elections are due, instead of nationwide restrictions.  

---

### **Global Perspective**  
Countries like South Africa and Sweden conduct simultaneous elections successfully, but they have less complex federal structures compared to India.

---

### **Conclusion**  
While simultaneous elections can bring administrative and financial efficiency, they pose significant constitutional, logistical, and political challenges. A phased implementation with broad political consensus and robust legal frameworks could make this ambitious proposal feasible.

> Simultaneous elections involve holding Lok Sabha and State Assembly polls together to reduce costs, enhance governance, and minimize election-related disruptions. Historically practiced until 1967, the idea requires constitutional amendments and logistical upgrades. Advantages include reduced expenses, administrative efficiency, better voter turnout, and policy continuity. However, challenges like undermining federalism, logistical complexity, and managing mid-term dissolutions persist. Recommendations include phased synchronization and partial simultaneity. While countries like South Africa conduct simultaneous polls, India's scale and diversity present unique hurdles. Achieving political consensus and creating a robust legal framework are essential for successful implementation, balancing efficiency with democratic principles.
