# How producer bias affects consumers

**Producer bias** refers to the bias that economic policymakers have to frame policies that are in favour of the interests of producers rather than in the general interest of consumers. Producer bias adversely affects economic growth of a country as policies that are favourable towards producers adversely affect the living standards of the general population.

It should be noted that the ultimate aim of economic production is to satisfy the needs of consumers, who benefit from better products and cheaper prices, rather than the interests of producers who would ideally want to benefit by offering inferior products at high prices. In other words, a country that strictly sticks to policies that protect producers from competition would produce very little for people to consume, **affecting the living standards of everyone in the long-run**. Take the case of a government policy that restricts the entry of new producers into a certain industry in order to protect existing producers. The policy would stop the entry of new producers into the industry who could increase the overall supply of the product in the market, or maybe even offer better products, and lead to a drop in prices.

### Tariffs as producer bias

The most clear-cut example of producer bias in today’s world is that of tariffs imposed by policymakers against foreign imports in order to protect domestic producers and jobs. The U.S. and the EU, for example, have threatened China with tariffs on its cheap electric vehicles. Even though cheap and better electric cars from China flooding the Western market would be great for American and European consumers, it could turn out to be disastrous for vehicle manufacturers in the EU and U.S. and lead to the loss of a significant number of jobs. This has pushed Western governments with a bias to threaten tariffs against China.

Public choice economists have attributed the prevalence of producer bias in policymaking to the greater lobbying power that producers have as compared to consumers. The economic benefits of lobbying generally accrue to a small group of producers, with each individual producer having a lot to gain from government policies that favour them. As a result, each producer has a huge incentive to invest the resources required to influence government policy to his or her favour. Individual consumers, on the other hand, have relatively little to lose at least in the short-term as the cost of policies with a producer bias is diffused among millions of consumers. So big companies that produce vehicles, for instance, are likely to heavily lobby the government to impose tariffs on foreign vehicles. Most individual vehicle buyers, on other hand, are unlikely to even be aware of government policy towards foreign vehicle manufacturers because the price they pay for such ignorance in the short-run is usually small. Interestingly, policies that favour producers are often cloaked as necessary to save jobs or to protect the interests of consumers in order to increase their political appeal.

### **How Producer Bias Affects Consumers**

**Producer bias** occurs when manufacturers, service providers, or sellers favor certain outcomes or interests, often prioritizing their profits or agendas over consumer welfare.

4. **Technology and Reviews:**
   - Consumers can use platforms providing unbiased reviews and price comparisons to make informed decisions.
   - Public feedback mechanisms can pressure producers to improve practices.

5. **Corporate Accountability:**
   - Producers must prioritize ethical practices, transparency, and genuine consumer engagement to foster trust.

---

### **Conclusion**

Producer bias, while often profit-driven, can severely affect consumer welfare by distorting choices, reducing quality, and fostering unfair practices. Addressing this bias requires a combination of consumer awareness, regulatory enforcement, and ethical corporate behavior. A balanced approach ensures that markets remain fair, transparent, and responsive to consumer needs, fostering sustainable economic and social well-being.

# Arvind Panagariya says issue of surcharges is complicated

**Arvind Panagariya**, Chairman, **16th Finance Commission**, on Tuesday termed the grievance of States regarding the Centre’s increasing reliance on cesses and surcharges as a “complicated issue.”

While it was a worrisome factor for many States, it was also, “in a way,” the Centre’s response to the reduction of its own fiscal space due to the increase in the share of States in the divisible tax pool over the years, he said, speaking to the media after meeting Kerala officials and other stakeholders at Kovalam.

Cesses and surcharges collected by the Centre need not be shared with the States. Their share in the gross tax revenue has risen over the years, prompting States to demand that the levies should be capped and that anything beyond it should flow into the divisible pool.

Dr. Panagariya observed that the share of States in the divisible pool has risen from 32% in the 13th Finance Commission to 42% under the 14th. The Centre, he noted, is entitled to collect cesses and surcharges under a Constitutional provision. 

### **Cess and Surcharge: Overview and Implications**

Cesses and surcharges are two distinct forms of taxation under India’s fiscal framework. They are levied by the Central government to meet specific needs or generate additional revenue. Over time, their increased share in gross tax revenue has become a contentious issue between the Centre and the States, raising concerns about fiscal federalism.

---

### **What is a Cess?**

A **cess** is a tax imposed for a specific purpose. Once the purpose is fulfilled, the cess should ideally be discontinued. For instance:
- **Education Cess:** Funds educational initiatives.
- **Health Cess:** Supports healthcare infrastructure.
- **Swachh Bharat Cess:** Promoted cleanliness and sanitation.

Cess collections are credited to the **Consolidated Fund of India (CFI)** but must be used exclusively for the earmarked purpose. Unlike other taxes in the divisible pool, cess revenue is **not shared with the States**.

---

### **What is a Surcharge?**

A **surcharge** is an additional tax levied on the existing base tax liability. Unlike a cess, it is not earmarked for any specific purpose. Examples include:
- **Surcharge on Income Tax:** Applies to individuals with higher income brackets.
- **Surcharge on Corporate Tax:** Levied on certain profitable businesses.

Surcharges are also credited to the **Consolidated Fund of India** and are entirely retained by the Central government. They, too, are **not shared with the States**.

---

### **Constitutional Basis**

Cesses and surcharges are imposed under **Article 271** of the Constitution. This provision empowers the Central government to levy these taxes over and above regular taxes.

---

### **Trends in Cesses and Surcharges**

Over recent years, the Centre’s reliance on cesses and surcharges has increased. Their share in gross tax revenue has risen from around 10% in 2011-12 to over 20% in 2021-22. States argue this trend erodes their fiscal space, as these revenues do not flow into the divisible pool, unlike other taxes under **Article 270**.

The **14th Finance Commission** increased the States’ share of the divisible pool from 32% to 42%, significantly boosting States’ revenues. However, the Centre has offset this by increasing the use of cesses and surcharges, which are outside the divisible pool.

---

### **Impact on States**

1. **Reduced Fiscal Space:**
   - The States lose a share of revenue from cesses and surcharges, reducing their resources for development and welfare programs.

2. **Dependence on the Centre:**
   - With limited access to such funds, States rely more on Central grants, undermining fiscal autonomy.

3. **Skewed Federalism:**
   - The increased use of cesses and surcharges distorts the principle of fiscal federalism by favoring the Centre’s financial priorities over those of the States.

---

### **Arguments in Favor of Cesses and Surcharges**

1. **Targeted Funding:**
   - Cesses allow the Centre to collect funds for critical issues like education and health without diluting resources for other expenditures.

2. **Flexibility:**
   - They provide the Centre with financial flexibility to address emergencies or fund large-scale projects.

3. **Revenue Augmentation:**
   - Helps bridge fiscal deficits without overburdening existing tax structures.

---

### **Arguments Against Increasing Reliance**

1. **Lack of Accountability:**
   - States have limited say in the allocation and usage of cess and surcharge revenues.

2. **Erosion of States’ Rights:**
   - Reduces the effectiveness of Finance Commissions in ensuring equitable distribution of taxes.

3. **Overlapping Taxes:**
   - Proliferation of cesses can lead to inefficiencies and confusion in tax collection.

---

### **Recommendations for Reform**

1. **Cap on Cesses and Surcharges:**
   - Introduce a legislative cap to prevent excessive reliance on these levies.

2. **Transparency:**
   - Mandate detailed reporting on the utilization of cess collections.

3. **Expand the Divisible Pool:**
   - Consider including a portion of cess and surcharge revenues in the divisible pool.

4. **Periodic Review:**
   - Finance Commissions should periodically assess the impact of cesses and surcharges on fiscal federalism.

5. **Strengthen State Finances:**
   - Increase grants-in-aid or create compensatory mechanisms for States affected by cesses and surcharges.

---

### **Conclusion**

Cesses and surcharges are important tools for the Centre to meet specific fiscal needs. However, their growing use at the expense of the divisible pool has strained Centre-State fiscal relations. A balanced approach that respects the principles of fiscal federalism while allowing the Centre the flexibility to address national priorities is essential. Collaborative mechanisms and reforms can ensure that both the Centre and the States have the resources needed to fulfill their constitutional obligations and developmental goals.

> Cesses and surcharges are taxes levied by the Central government, with cesses earmarked for specific purposes and surcharges applied to existing taxes without a specific purpose. Unlike regular taxes, their revenue is not shared with States, leading to concerns about reduced fiscal space and undermining fiscal federalism. Their share in gross tax revenue has risen significantly, prompting States to demand caps and inclusion in the divisible pool. While these levies provide flexibility and targeted funding for national priorities, they limit States’ financial autonomy. Reforms like capping their use, enhancing transparency, and expanding the divisible pool can ensure balanced fiscal relations.
