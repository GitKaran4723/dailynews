# Gamify India’s skilling initiatives

The problem of unemployment has become a contentious issue in economic policy discussions in India in recent times. Economic Survey 2023-24 estimated that India needs to create 78.5 lakh new jobs in the non-farm sector annually until 2030 to meet the demands of the rising workforce. One of the policy prescriptions often suggested to overcome the unemployment challenge is to close the growing gap between the skill sets of job seekers and the skill requirements of the industry.

### India’s skilling challenge

Over time, India has established a comprehensive institutional and policy framework for training and skilling. However, the success of this is somewhat limited. The Periodic Labour Force Survey 2022-23 identified that only 21% of the Indian youth aged 15-29 years had received vocational/technical training through formal and informal sources. The share of youth who had received formal vocational/technical training was 4.4% in 2022-23. The Chief Economic Advisor, V. Anantha Nageswaran, recently stated that only 51% of India’s graduates are employable. These facts raise concerns regarding the reach, quality, and industry relevance of existing skilling programmes. Incidentally, one of the focus areas of the Prime Minister’s package for employment and skilling announced in the 2024-25 Budget was improving the outcome and quality of skilling and aligning the training content and design to the skill needs of the industry.

The enormity of India’s skilling challenge is further aggravated by the need to equip the workforce with skills and knowledge that meet the requirements of industry 4.0 (I4.0), which entails integrating advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, robotics, the internet of things, and big data to do smart manufacturing. Over two-thirds of Indian manufacturers are expected to embrace digital transformation by 2025. Government policy support has been given to prepare the industry for I4.0 through the SAMARTH Udyog Bharat 4.0 initiative. But according to estimates, only 1.5% of Indian engineers possess the skills for new-age jobs. Sixty percent of the Indian MSME workforce lacks the new-age digital skills. So, it becomes crucial to skill and upskill our workforce according to I4.0 needs.

### A new initiative

India could consider incorporating gamified and simulation-based learning and training modules. While gamified learning incorporates game elements into skill training, simulation-based learning uses virtual environments that mimic real-world scenarios, allowing learners to practice and apply skills in a safe and controlled setting. Using game mechanics makes skill training interactive and enjoyable, leading to higher participant engagement and knowledge retention than traditional learning methods. Also, the rewards and recognition through points and badges can motivate learners to complete training tasks and strive for excellence. Gamified systems often provide instant feedback to help trainees understand their progress and areas for improvement. Features such as ‘Leaderboards and challenges’ can foster a sense of competition, thereby encouraging trainees to perform better. Clear goals and milestones in gamified learning help trainees stay focused.

Simulation-based learning provides hands-on experience in a controlled environment and allows trainees to experiment, make mistakes, and learn from them without bothering about real-world consequences. Simulations also help trainees understand complex systems and develop critical thinking, problem-solving, and practical skills. Also, the immersive nature of the simulations allows learners to retain the knowledge gained for longer. Singapore and Germany have adopted gamified and simulation-based learning into their education, vocational, and skill training systems.

Adopting such a module in government skilling programmes can potentially improve the quality and outcome of workforce training. The module can be customised by identifying areas where skill sets are lacking. Trainees can be presented with challenges during training that will be adjusted based on their progress. The platform can feature training modules that simulate actual professional circumstances, enabling trainees to apply their knowledge practically. Simulations can assess the trainee’s decision-making abilities and demonstrate the outcomes resulting from their decisions. At a decentralised level, the module can be extended to education institutes of higher learning by providing the students with a platform to work on real-world projects. Students can be given opportunities to intern on live projects and demonstrate their skills, and industry can use this talent pool while hiring.

The **SWAYAM and Skill India Digital Hub (SIDH)**, the two online platforms for skill education and training initiated by the Indian government, can host the gamified and simulation training module. The SWAYAM platform hosts more than 4,000 courses. Since its inception, over 40 million participants have enrolled in the platform and a lion’s share (93.45%) of successful course completions in the platform were under the engineering and physical sciences stream. As of June 2024, 7.63 lakh candidates were enrolled in SIDH’s 752 online courses. The platform offers 7.37 lakh minutes of digital content, making it a potentially rich resource for learners. The response to SWAYAM and SIDH demonstrates the huge demand for technical education and training in India and further strengthens the idea of offering gamified and simulation-based skill training on such platforms.

> Gamifying India’s skilling initiatives can revolutionize workforce development by making learning engaging and goal-oriented. Incorporating game elements like rewards, leaderboards, badges, and challenges into programs such as **Skill India** or **PMKVY** (Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana) can motivate participation and improve skill retention. Virtual reality (VR) simulations for hands-on training, interactive quizzes for assessments, and community competitions can drive engagement. Such gamification fosters collaboration, increases course completion rates, and prepares learners for real-world applications. By integrating gaming techniques into skilling initiatives, India can create a dynamic learning ecosystem, bridging skill gaps and boosting employability across industries.

# The place of charity in an unequal society

Billionaire **Warren Buffet**, with a net worth of almost **$121 billion** by some estimates, has maintained his pledge of giving away his wealth. In a recent message to shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway, he has mentioned a transfer of his wealth to foundations overseen by his children, a total amount of around 870 million dollars. In all, it is estimated that he has given away an amount of **$52 billion**.

Mr. Buffet’s recent message has captured the attention of mainstream discourse as it has outlined his **social philosophy with regard to wealth and its place in society**. Mr. Buffet believes that wealth should be used to **equalise opportunities**, that the **luck that favoured** certain individuals and helped them get rich should be extended after one’s death in order to help those less fortunate. While it is not wrong to amass and accumulate wealth during one’s lifetime, allowing it to build across generations is a problem for society. While it is no doubt commendable that Mr. Buffet wishes to give away his fortune, one must also question the processes generating the concentration of such wealth in the first place, regardless of whether it is to be used for philanthropy or not. Inequality is not a question of luck, but of specific policy institutions determined by society. In a world of spiralling inequality, both private philanthropy and the problems it tries to solve are two sides of the same coin, emerging from the very same set of social processes.

### On luck and equal opportunity

Mr. Buffet’s ideas with regard to wealth and welfare can be seen in the context of a philosophical idea called **“luck egalitarianism”**, which states that no-one should have to suffer the consequences of inequality owing to bad luck or adverse situations. As Mr. Buffet repeatedly stresses in his letter, he credits much of his personal fortune to fortuitous circumstances, such as being born as a white male in the U.S. Opportunities were open to him that would not be open to women or African-Americans, and the growth of the U.S. over the years caused his wealth to grow significantly through the power of compound interest.

Some might accuse Mr. Buffet of false modesty, claiming that his fortune has been generated through his own diligent efforts and his understanding of markets. But there is truth in what he says. As Branko Milanovic has shown, a significant factor driving global inequality is the differences in income between countries. Where one is born determines how wealthy one might be relative to the global population. In that regard, Mr. Buffet does display a strong egalitarian zeal. If fortune played a huge role in the differences between Mr. Buffet and others, there is no moral justification for him to pass on his wealth to his descendants. The only moral response is to ensure his wealth can be used to boost the opportunities of those less fortunate. What matters is the equalising of opportunities, and allowing individuals a level playing field in the beginning, rather than trying to equalise final outcomes.

### What about charity?

However, there are some important questions that need to be addressed. The distribution of private wealth through charity may help to equalise well-being between individuals, but the process by which this wealth was generated and concentrated has led to the differences in opportunities in the first place. In the developed world, wealth distribution was largely equal during the post World War II period. Widespread deregulation and a turn towards neo-liberal economics saw an explosion of wealth inequality from the 1980s onwards, with the ‘trickle-down’ economics of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher leading to the concentration of gains for a tiny sliver of individuals and stagnant wages for the majority. In India as well, the liberalisation of the economy may have led to faster growth, but has dramatically increased inequality and skewed the distribution of opportunities.

Differences in opportunities are not merely a question of luck, but of specific policy choices and interventions. **Bill Gates’ and Jeff Bezos’** wealth came from the monopolies they enjoyed in the marketplace; this is less luck than the failure of policy to ensure competitive market practices. Mckenzie Bezos might be doing important work in giving away much of her wealth, but one must ask how it was that Amazon generated so much money for its owners while its workers suffered through stagnant wages and harmful working conditions. Mr. Buffet earned much of his wealth through the compounding of his initial equity holdings, but the widespread financialisation of the U.S. economy — concomitant with the reduction in the power of unions and stagnant wage growth — greatly aided this process.

In the face of rising inequality, societies face a choice: to either do nothing and hope that private charity increases, or devise policy to counter the negative effects of rising wealth concentration. Thomas Piketty advocates for a system of taxation and redistribution backed by the State to ensure equalisation of opportunities, rather than relying on private philanthropy. Interventionist thinkers and those on the left advocate for higher minimum wages and constraints on billionaire compensation. The use of state policy ensures that one does not have to rely on billionaire conscience to ameliorate the very processes that gave rise to their wealth in the first place.

### **The Place of Charity in an Unequal Society**

Charity plays a significant role in addressing inequalities within societies marked by disparities in wealth, resources, and opportunities. In an unequal society, charity functions not only as a mechanism for alleviating immediate suffering but also as a means to bridge gaps in access to education, healthcare, and basic amenities. However, its role is multifaceted, balancing short-term relief with the potential for long-term systemic impact.

---

### **Role of Charity in an Unequal Society**

1. **Immediate Relief for the Underprivileged**:
   - Charity provides essential support to marginalized sections, offering food, shelter, and medical care.
   - Organizations and individuals step in where state mechanisms fail, addressing emergencies such as natural disasters or health crises.

2. **Facilitating Access to Opportunities**:
   - Charitable efforts in education and skill development empower individuals to overcome socio-economic barriers.
   - Scholarships, vocational training programs, and free healthcare services create pathways for upward mobility.

3. **Advancing Social Justice**:
   - Charitable initiatives often highlight systemic inequalities, sparking conversations about structural changes.
   - Philanthropy can target historically marginalized communities, advocating for their inclusion and development.

4. **Filling Gaps in Public Systems**:
   - In societies with inadequate governance or welfare systems, charity compensates for state deficiencies, ensuring critical needs are met.

---

### **Challenges of Charity in Addressing Inequality**

1. **Temporary Solutions**:
   - Charity often provides short-term relief without addressing the root causes of inequality, such as systemic poverty, discrimination, and lack of infrastructure.

2. **Dependency Issues**:
   - Excessive reliance on charity can create a dependency mindset, disempowering beneficiaries from seeking sustainable solutions.

3. **Power Dynamics and Inequities in Philanthropy**:
   - Charity initiatives can sometimes reinforce existing power structures, with donors exerting control over how resources are allocated.
   - Large-scale philanthropy may prioritize donor-driven agendas over grassroots needs.

4. **Unequal Distribution of Charity**:
   - Charity often favors causes that are visible or emotionally appealing, neglecting less "popular" but equally important issues.

---

### **Balancing Charity with Structural Reform**

1. **Complementing Government Efforts**:
   - Charity should support and enhance state welfare programs rather than replace them.
   - Collaboration between governments, NGOs, and private entities can maximize the impact of charitable efforts.

2. **Focus on Empowerment**:
   - Charity should prioritize long-term empowerment, such as education, skill development, and healthcare, over mere handouts.

3. **Encouraging Social Responsibility**:
   - Encouraging the wealthy to contribute through tax incentives or corporate social responsibility (CSR) programs can address inequalities effectively.

4. **Addressing Root Causes**:
   - Charitable organizations must target systemic issues such as education access, healthcare disparities, and income inequality to create lasting change.

---

### **The Ethical Imperative of Charity**
In an unequal society, charity is an ethical obligation for those with resources. It fosters empathy, strengthens community bonds, and reduces social tensions arising from visible disparities.

---

### **Conclusion**
While charity cannot replace systemic reforms, it plays a crucial role in providing immediate relief, creating opportunities, and raising awareness about inequalities. For meaningful change, it must evolve beyond a temporary solution into a force for empowerment and justice. By addressing both symptoms and causes of inequality, charity can contribute to a more equitable and inclusive society.

> Charity plays a vital role in addressing inequalities in society by providing immediate relief, creating opportunities, and filling gaps in public welfare systems. It supports marginalized communities with essential services like education, healthcare, and skill development, empowering them for upward mobility. However, charity often faces challenges such as promoting dependency, addressing only short-term issues, and being donor-driven rather than need-based. To maximize its impact, charity must complement government efforts, focus on empowerment, and target systemic inequalities like poverty and discrimination. While not a replacement for structural reform, charity is an ethical obligation that can foster equity and community resilience.

# A worrying mismatch

The tragic deaths of five women following cesarean deliveries at the district hospital in Ballari, Karnataka, have spotlighted critical lapses in public healthcare and maternal care. Out of 34 women who underwent C-sections between November 9 and 11, seven developed severe complications, including acute kidney injury and multi-organ dysfunction, with five fatalities reported. Alarmingly, none of these women had high-risk pregnancies, emphasizing systemic failures in ensuring patient safety.

An expert committee from the Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences (RGUHS) attributed these deaths to the administration of a substandard batch of Compound Sodium Lactate Injection IP (Ringer’s Lactate solution), a common intravenous fluid used to restore hydration and electrolyte balance. The injection, a vital component of post-surgical care, was found to be contaminated, leading to life-threatening complications. This raises concerns about the quality control and procurement processes in the supply of essential medical drugs and fluids within public healthcare facilities.

# The issue of India’s economic growth versus emissions

The Indian economy has consistently showcased its robust growth over the past few decades. But higher economic growth is believed to have come with increasing environmental pressure, notably through higher greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, India’s Economic Survey (2023-24) claims that India has decoupled its economic growth from GHG emissions, as between 2005 and 2019, India’s GDP grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7%, while emissions rose at a CAGR of just 4%. This raises a crucial question: has India really decoupled its economic growth from GHG emissions? And, what does this mean for sustainable development?

### What it means

Decoupling refers to breaking the link between economic growth and environmental degradation. Historically, economic growth is found to be positively related with environmental degradation, as this growth is believed to be a driver of GHG emissions. However, with the growing climate crisis, the imperative to reduce emissions while ensuring continued economic growth has gained global traction.

Decoupling has largely been classified into two types: absolute decoupling and relative decoupling. Absolute decoupling occurs when the economy grows, while emissions decrease. This is the ideal form of decoupling, where countries grow economically without increasing environmental harm. However, relative decoupling happens when both GDP and emissions grow, but the rate of GDP growth surpasses the rate of emissions growth. While this signifies progress, at the same time, it acknowledges that emissions continue to rise.

Decoupling of economic growth and GHG emissions is important. On one hand, it offers a path to sustainable growth and development, a way for nations to grow and improve living standards without exacerbating climate change. On the other, it comes as a response to rising demand for degrowth and sparks the ongoing debate between green growth and degrowth. Proponents of green growth argue that it is possible to maintain or even increase economic growth while reducing environmental harm. In contrast, degrowth advocates suggest that economic growth itself is the primary driver of ecological degradation and should be curbed in favour of reducing resource consumption. But proponents of degrowth overlook the fact that countries, in addition to tackling rising GHG emissions and the climate change, are also required to tackle low standards of living, energy poverty and ensure a decent life, which could be taken care of through economic growth.

### The claim

The claim of India’s decoupling made in the Economic Survey comes from comparing GDP and emissions growth rates between 2005 and 2019. The Survey does not specify whether this represents absolute or relative decoupling. Using various decoupling indicators discussed in OECD (2002), we examine the status of the economy-wide and sector-wise decoupling status for India. Since the 1990s, with significant trade liberalisation, India has been experiencing steady and stable economic growth. Hence, we are examining how GDP and emission generation are growing in India with respect to the levels of 1990. While there has been no absolute decoupling in India, since 1990, GDP in India has grown at a much higher pace than the GHG emissions in the country, indicating economy-wide relative decoupling. Since, the agriculture and manufacturing sectors are among the major contributors of emission generation in India, it is also important to understand whether these sectors have also achieved decoupling or not, which has been assessed by comparing rate of growth of GVA of the respective sector with the rate of growth of GHGs emitted by the sector. From 1990, India’s GDP has grown six-fold, while GHG emissions have only tripled.

### Efforts must continue

From the data, it seems that India may have achieved relative decoupling, where emissions are still rising but at a slower pace than the economy. This achievement, while commendable, falls short of the ultimate goal of absolute decoupling, where economic growth can continue even as emissions fall. While most countries fall short of achieving absolute decoupling and still experience rising emissions as GDP increases, many countries have at least managed to achieve a declining rate of growth of emissions. Given that India is a developing country which has not even peaked its emissions yet, emissions are expected to increase with economic growth. Hence, achieving absolute decoupling is not going to happen anytime soon. While India’s relative decoupling is a step in the right direction, the path to absolute decoupling is still a long and complex journey. Efforts must still be taken and it will be a significant challenge. This remains a necessary target if India is to meet its long-term climate commitments. Policies and measures that support renewable energy, emission mitigation, and sustainable development will be crucial in ensuring that economic growth and environmental preservation can coexist, ensuring a prosperous and sustainable future for India.

### **India’s Economic Growth Versus Emissions: A Balancing Act**

India faces a critical challenge in balancing its aspirations for robust economic growth with the need to address emissions and environmental sustainability. As a developing country with ambitious goals for industrialization, urbanization, and poverty alleviation, India is also among the world's largest greenhouse gas emitters, a paradox that necessitates strategic and sustainable solutions.

---

### **Economic Growth and Emissions: The Link**

1. **Rapid Industrialization**:
   - India’s economic growth relies heavily on energy-intensive industries like steel, cement, and manufacturing, which are significant contributors to carbon emissions.
   - Expansion of coal-fired power plants, which supply about **50% of India’s electricity**, remains a major source of emissions.

2. **Urbanization and Infrastructure Development**:
   - Urbanization demands extensive infrastructure development, including roads, housing, and transportation, which increase energy consumption.
   - Increased use of fossil fuels for urban mobility adds to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.

3. **Energy Demand**:
   - As the world’s **third-largest energy consumer**, India’s reliance on fossil fuels, especially coal, exacerbates emissions.
   - Economic growth has significantly increased energy demand, leading to higher emissions per capita.
