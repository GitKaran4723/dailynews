# Has the government clarified its stance on ONOS?

On November 25, the Indian government announced the launch of its **‘One Nation, One Subscription’ (ONOS)** plan to improve access to research journals for the country’s public education and research institutes. The announcement was accompanied with scant details and broached widespread criticism from the research community, especially over what was perceived to be its disproportionate expense and lack of support for open-access publishing. On December 11, government officials conducted a press conference in New Delhi that addressed many of these concerns.

### What is ONOS’s purpose?

When scientists conclude an experiment, they write up their methods and findings and publish it as a paper in a journal. The journal collects, reviews, edits, publishes, and archives these papers as a service to other scholars and the people at large. In exchange, journals levy a fee. Subscription-based journals charge readers a fee to read papers. Some forms of Open-Access (OA) journals, called ‘gold’ OA, charge researchers to publish their paper. Institutes in India had subscribed to subscription journals through 10 or so consortia within the country. ONOS will replace these consortia as a single window through which all government-funded institutes in the country will be able to access more than 13,000 journals published by 30 major international publishers.

### Why did ONOS provoke criticism?

At the time of announcement, a Ministry of Education press release didn’t specify which journals would be part of ONOS, how ONOS would be implemented, how its allocation of ₹6,000 crore (for three calendar years) would be spent, and how ONOS would support efforts to make research OA. Experts on the topic also asked whether the allocation for foreign journals could have been used to support domestic publishing efforts instead.

Also it wasn’t clear whether ONOS would help scientists pay to publish in gold OA journals or whether these payments — called article processing charges (APCs) — could be discounted.

### What was revealed on December 11?

The press conference was attended by officials from the office of the Principal Scientific Advisor (PSA), the Department of Science & Technology, and the Department of Higher Education.

The package: Students and staff at all public institutes will be able to access all papers in the journals participating in ONOS irrespective of their discipline. Negotiations are underway to bring in more journals.

**Phases**: Remya Haridasan, a scientist at the PSA’s office, said the government would implement ONOS in three phases: (i) merge all the consortia and work to facilitate journal access in all public institutes; (ii) expand to include private institutions; (iii) create “universal access” to all citizens “through designated access points at public libraries”.

**Open access**: In a pilot, ONOS would set aside ₹150 crore a year to pay for APCs. The government has also negotiated APC discounts for researchers to publish in certain OA journals. The officials said they are aware of transformative OA models and that ONOS would encompass them as it progressed. As of today, they said, around 65% of papers published by Indian scientists were in subscription-based journals.

**Domestic efforts**: Officials at the press conference acknowledged the need to support domestic publishers. They said there were five repositories in the country — servers where researchers could deposit digital copies of their papers and where others could freely access them — but that scientists were using them to a less-than-ideal degree. They added that other efforts need to take place, such as “enhancement, promotion, and support of Indian journals” and changes in how institutes evaluate the work of researchers, especially to reduce dependence on journal titles and increase focus on the merit of each person’s work.

> The government has approved the **One Nation One Subscription (ONOS)** scheme, allocating ₹6,000 crore for 2025-2027 to provide nationwide access to over 13,000 e-journals from 30 global publishers. Targeting 6,300 government institutions and benefiting 1.8 crore students, faculty, and researchers, the initiative aims to democratize access to scholarly resources. Implemented through INFLIBNET, ONOS promotes cost efficiency, equitable resource distribution, and fosters a research culture aligned with NEP 2020. Scheduled to launch on January 1, 2025, it also plans to negotiate Article Processing Charges (APCs) to further ease research expenses, marking a transformative step for India's academic and research ecosystem.

   - **Rajya Sabha** (Council of States): Represents the states and union territories; members are indirectly elected or nominated.

**2. Structure of Parliament in India:**
   - **President:** Integral part of Parliament; signs bills into law and can summon or dissolve sessions.
   - **Lok Sabha:** 
      - Maximum strength: 552 (530 from states, 20 from UTs, and 2 Anglo-Indians nominated by the President if necessary).
      - Tenure: 5 years.
   - **Rajya Sabha:** 
      - Maximum strength: 250 members (238 elected, 12 nominated for expertise in fields like literature, science, art, and social service).

### **Disruptions in Parliament**

**1. What are Disruptions?**
Disruptions occur when members of Parliament (MPs) resort to protests, sloganeering, or boycotting sessions, halting the proceedings. These actions often reflect political conflicts, grievances, or demands.

**2. Common Causes of Disruptions:**
   - **Political Rivalry:** Clashes between ruling and opposition parties over contentious issues.
   - **Lack of Consensus:** Inability to agree on legislative priorities or policies.
   - **Contentious Bills or Policies:** Disagreements over proposed laws or government initiatives.
   - **Scams or Corruption Allegations:** Opposition parties may demand debates or investigations.
   - **Demand for Regional or Minority Interests:** MPs sometimes disrupt sessions to press for state or community-specific concerns.
   - **Misuse of Parliamentary Privileges:** MPs may exploit privileges to stage unwarranted protests.

**3. Impact of Disruptions:**
   - **Legislative Stalemate:** Delays in passing critical bills or budgets.
   - **Economic Costs:** Wastes taxpayers' money; each minute of Parliament costs lakhs of rupees.
   - **Erosion of Public Trust:** Frequent disruptions reduce faith in the democratic process.
   - **Undermining Accountability:** Shifts focus away from important debates and oversight functions.
   - **Weakening of Parliamentary Norms:** Sets a poor precedent for future parliamentary behavior.

---

### **Solutions to Curb Disruptions**

**1. Structural and Procedural Reforms:**
   - **Time Allocation:** Reserve specific time slots for opposition to raise issues.
   - **Code of Conduct:** Implement a strict code of conduct for MPs to ensure decorum.
   - **Automatic Suspension:** Enforce automatic suspension of MPs engaging in unruly behavior.
   - **Streamlining Question Hour:** Prevent misuse and ensure relevant questions are asked.

**2. Behavioral and Cultural Reforms:**
   - **Training Programs:** Conduct orientation programs for MPs to understand parliamentary procedures and responsibilities.
   - **Consensus Building:** Encourage pre-session meetings between ruling and opposition parties to resolve disputes amicably.
   - **Ethical Leadership:** MPs must prioritize national interest over political gains.

**3. Technological and Logistical Solutions:**
   - **Live Telecasting:** Increase transparency through live telecasts to discourage disruptive behavior.
   - **E-Parliament:** Introduce digital platforms for real-time discussions and decision-making.

**4. Legal Measures:**
   - **Anti-Disruption Laws:** Enact laws to penalize disruptive actions, including fines and disqualification.
   - **Judicial Intervention:** Allow courts to intervene in cases of prolonged parliamentary disruptions.

**5. Public Awareness:**
   - **Civic Education:** Educate citizens about the role of Parliament and the negative effects of disruptions.
   - **Citizen Feedback:** Provide platforms for public opinions on MPs’ performance.

> The Indian Parliament, comprising the Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha, and the President, is the supreme legislative body responsible for law-making, financial control, and executive accountability. Disruptions in Parliament occur due to political rivalry, contentious policies, or regional demands, leading to legislative delays, economic costs, and erosion of public trust. Solutions include enforcing a code of conduct, time allocation for debates, consensus-building, and penalizing unruly behavior. Technological upgrades, public awareness, and training programs for MPs can ensure smoother proceedings. By prioritizing decorum and national interest, Parliament can function effectively as the "Temple of Democracy," upholding its crucial role in governance.

# A wide aisle

### **Situation Analysis**

In an unprecedented move in Indian parliamentary history, 60 Opposition members of the Rajya Sabha have expressed a loss of confidence in the Chairman, Jagdeep Dhankhar, who also serves as the Vice-President of India. They have submitted a resolution seeking his removal, citing allegations of partisanship and bias in his rulings and public statements. The Opposition’s grievances include his decision to allow BJP MPs to speak on a rejected adjournment motion and his alleged denial of opportunities for the Leader of the Opposition to voice concerns. This incident reflects a deepening trust deficit between the Chair and the Opposition, which is harmful to democratic norms. Such positions are expected to remain apolitical, and the motion signals a troubling turn in parliamentary democracy.

---

### **Constitutional Provisions and Procedure for Removing the Rajya Sabha Chairman/Vice-President**

The Vice-President of India, as the ex-officio Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, can be removed from office through a constitutional procedure outlined in **Articles 67(b)** and **94(c)** of the Indian Constitution.

#### **Relevant Constitutional Articles:**
1. **Article 67(b):** The Vice-President can be removed by a resolution of the Rajya Sabha, passed by an absolute majority (a majority of the total membership of the house) and agreed to by the Lok Sabha. 
2. **Article 94(c):** Specifies conditions for removal related to the Speaker or Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha, which are not directly applicable here but emphasize neutrality and conduct.
3. **Article 61:** Governs the impeachment of the President but provides a template for the seriousness required in removing constitutional officers.

---

### **Procedure for Removal of the Vice-President:**
1. **Initiation of Notice:**
   - A resolution for removal can be moved in the Rajya Sabha.
   - It requires at least 14 days’ advance notice.
   - The notice must be signed by a minimum of **one-fourth** of the total members of the Rajya Sabha.

2. **Discussion and Debate:**
   - The motion is taken up for discussion in the Rajya Sabha.
   - A resolution is passed if supported by an **absolute majority** (majority of the total membership) of the Rajya Sabha.

3. **Approval by Lok Sabha:**
   - The resolution is then sent to the Lok Sabha for approval.
   - It must also be passed by the Lok Sabha with a **simple majority** (majority of members present and voting).

4. **Outcome:**
   - If both Houses pass the resolution, the Vice-President stands removed from office.

---

### **Challenges and Implications:**
1. **Practical Feasibility:**
   - The ruling party's numerical strength in both houses often makes such resolutions difficult to pass.
   - In this case, the resolution is unlikely to succeed given the BJP's majority.

2. **Democratic Norms:**
   - Allegations of partisanship undermine the Vice-President's role as a neutral Chair.
   - Such instances can set a precedent for questioning the impartiality of constitutional offices.

3. **Need for Reforms:**
   - To safeguard democracy, it is essential to insulate these offices from political pressures.
   - Mechanisms should be in place to address trust deficits between the Chair and Opposition members without resorting to extreme measures.

---

This situation highlights the importance of trust, impartiality, and adherence to democratic norms in the functioning of parliamentary democracy. Strengthening these values is crucial to prevent such confrontations in the future.

> In an unprecedented move, 60 Rajya Sabha MPs from the Opposition have sought the removal of Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar, citing partisanship and bias in his rulings and public statements. The Opposition alleges favoritism toward BJP MPs, denial of speaking opportunities to their leader, and amplification of government views. The motion reflects a deepening trust deficit between the Chair and the Opposition, damaging democratic norms. As per Article 67(b), the Vice-President can be removed through resolutions passed by an absolute Rajya Sabha majority and a simple Lok Sabha majority. This highlights the need for neutrality in constitutional offices to uphold democracy.

# The long and complex road to assisted dying

### **The Debate on Assisted Dying**

The introduction of the **Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill 2024-25** in Britain’s House of Commons highlights the complexities and sensitivities surrounding assisted dying. The distressing narrative shared by MP Kim Leadbeater—of a terminally ill man suffering a prolonged, agonizing death—brings the ethical and moral dimensions of this debate into sharp focus. The man's inability to receive compassionate medical intervention, despite his family's pleas, underscores the need to examine how societies address terminal illness, pain, and dignity at the end of life.

#### **Legal Landscape in Britain and India**
- Britain’s deliberations on assisted dying laws assume a universal value, as they touch on dignity, autonomy, and freedom of choice. However, drafting laws that prevent misuse while respecting individual rights is a monumental challenge.
- In **India**, the Supreme Court has recognized a limited right to die, allowing **passive euthanasia** and **advance medical directives** in the 2018 judgment in *Common Cause v. Union of India*. This ruling emphasized the right to privacy, liberty, and dignity as fundamental to end-of-life decisions.

The transition from passive euthanasia to assisted dying in India would require a shift in societal attitudes, legislative frameworks, and medical ethics. Despite complexities, the principle at stake—human dignity and the right to choose—resonates deeply with foundational freedoms.

---

### **Euthanasia: Definitions and Types**

**Euthanasia** refers to the practice of intentionally ending a person's life to relieve suffering. The term originates from the Greek words *eu* (good) and *thanatos* (death), meaning "good death."

#### **Types of Euthanasia**
1. **Active Euthanasia:**
   - Involves directly causing the death of a patient, such as administering a lethal injection.
   - Illegal in most countries due to ethical concerns but debated for its potential to provide relief from suffering.

2. **Passive Euthanasia:**
   - Involves withdrawing or withholding life-sustaining treatments, allowing the patient to die naturally.
   - Recognized in India under strict conditions following the *Common Cause* judgment.

3. **Voluntary Euthanasia:**
   - Performed with the consent of the patient.
   - Emphasizes autonomy and choice.

4. **Involuntary Euthanasia:**
   - Performed without the patient’s consent, often equated with murder and widely condemned.

5. **Non-Voluntary Euthanasia:**
   - Conducted when the patient is unable to give consent (e.g., in cases of coma or severe mental incapacitation).

6. **Physician-Assisted Suicide (PAS):**
   - A doctor provides the means for a patient to end their own life, typically by prescribing lethal medication.

---

### **Ethics Associated with Euthanasia**

The ethical debate surrounding euthanasia revolves around the principles of autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice. These principles often conflict, making euthanasia a deeply divisive issue.

#### **Arguments in Favor of Euthanasia:**
1. **Respect for Autonomy:**
   - Individuals have the right to make decisions about their own lives, including how and when to die.
2. **Relief from Suffering:**
   - Offers a compassionate way to end unbearable pain and suffering in terminally ill patients.
3. **Preservation of Dignity:**
   - Allows individuals to avoid a prolonged, undignified end of life, maintaining their self-respect.
4. **Economic Considerations:**
   - Reduces the financial burden on families and healthcare systems in cases where treatment offers no hope of recovery.

#### **Arguments Against Euthanasia:**
1. **Sanctity of Life:**
   - Life is inherently valuable, and intentionally ending it undermines this principle.
2. **Slippery Slope Argument:**
   - Legalizing euthanasia could lead to misuse, such as pressure on vulnerable individuals to end their lives.
3. **Possibility of Recovery:**
   - Advances in medicine may offer cures or relief even in seemingly hopeless cases.
4. **Moral and Religious Beliefs:**
   - Many religions and ethical systems view euthanasia as morally wrong.

#### **Balancing Autonomy and Vulnerability:**
   - Ensuring informed consent is vital to prevent coercion.
   - Laws must be meticulously crafted to prevent abuse while respecting individual autonomy.

---

### **Conclusion**

The debate on assisted dying, exemplified by Britain’s ongoing deliberations, highlights the intersection of law, ethics, and human dignity. While passive euthanasia is legally recognized in India, extending this to active euthanasia or assisted dying would require careful consideration of ethical concerns, societal values, and safeguards. At its core, the issue emphasizes the importance of autonomy, compassion, and respect for human dignity, reaffirming the right to live—and die—with meaning and purpose.

> The debate on assisted dying, reignited by Britain’s **Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill 2024-25**, underscores the ethical and legal challenges of granting individuals the right to choose their end-of-life options. Euthanasia, whether active (direct intervention) or passive (withdrawing life-sustaining treatments), raises questions of autonomy, dignity, and relief from suffering versus the sanctity of life and risks of misuse. In India, the Supreme Court’s 2018 *Common Cause* judgment permits passive euthanasia and advance directives, emphasizing dignity and privacy. While extending this to assisted dying is contentious, the need for compassionate, ethically sound laws remains central to upholding human dignity.

# Vaikom — two States, two leaders and a tale of reform

A little over a 100 years ago was a landmark socio-political moment like no other. The Vaikom Struggle, which culminated in the lifting of the barriers to the entry of backward caste Hindus to the local temple in the erstwhile Travancore princely state, would be the first of many mass movements that brought political attention to religious reform. Since then, the Dravidian Movement founded by **Periyar E.V. Ramasamy** and its **self-respect principles** have enabled wider reforms within the Hindu religion and paved the way for a more egalitarian society. What is less understood is that this was made possible only due to the insertion of a key clause in the Constitution by Dr. **B.R. Ambedkar**. Celebrating the **centenary of Vaikom** is not just a tribute to **Periyar’s persistence and B.R. Ambedkar’s acumen** but also a re-assertion of the strong reformist tendencies that continue to pervade through modern-day politik in South India.

### The evolution of a mass movement

The **Vaikom Struggle** was fought against the prohibition of backward caste Hindus from walking on the streets adjacent to the **Vaikom Mahadeva temple**. When leaders of Kerala State Congress Committee and other social activist leaders began agitating against the injustice, they faced a clamp down by the administration. With the entry of **Periyar in 1924**, it slowly became a mass movement, bringing people from all classes within its fold. In November 1925, when the restrictions to walk on the streets finally lifted, the long arc of political movement began tilting towards social justice. In the decade that followed, movements erupted in other parts of the country, with B.R. Ambedkar leading protests to enter the Ambadevi Temple and Kalaram Mandir, where Dalits were denied entry.

However, the trajectory of reform in South India was progressing at a faster pace with the Legislative Assembly introducing a Bill to allow temple entry in 1932, followed by the Travancore Temple Entry Proclamation in 1936, the Malabar Temple Entry Bill 1938. There was also the entry of backward castes in the Madurai Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple and the Thanjavur Brihadeeswara Temple in 1939. The Madras Temple Entry Authorization Act 1947 enabled Hindus of all castes to enter and offer worship in all temples within the then Madras Presidency.

Though many of these reforms took place prior to the adoption of the Constitution of India, the Constituent Assembly took great care in delimiting the right to freedom of religion. During discussions on December 7, 1948, B.R. Ambedkar included the prefix ‘subject to public order, morality and health’ restricting the extent of the fundamental right and thereby enabling state intervention when necessary.

These seven words went on to form the legal and legitimate basis for reforms within the fold of religion, thereby enabling constitutional courts to intercede when there was a contestation of fundamental rights, namely between those of equality and religion.

### State and the issue of regulation

The larger issue has always been whether temples, and religion at large, can be regulated by the state. If this is allowed, some argue, then the government will lose its secular character. There can be nothing further from the truth or logic. The intervention of the State to regulate temples, which are public spaces, is to ensure equality and access. A long history, beginning with the enactment of the Madras Hindu Religious Endowments Act 1927 to the present-day Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act 1959, would make it apparent the legislative intent to manage religious affairs in consonance with public order and morality. This position has been confirmed through various judgments beginning from The Commissioner, Hindu Religious Endowments, Madras vs Sri Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar of Sri Shirur Mutt 1954 (Shirur Mutt case), where the Supreme Court of India upheld the proposition that the state can manage the secular affairs of the temple and propounded the test of essential religious practice.

Since then, successive governments in Tamil Nadu, beginning in 1970, have enacted laws to enable backward caste Hindus to be appointed as archakas (priests), which some have regarded as a contentious act of interference in religious affairs. In such instances, the Court has upheld the right of the State to manage secular matters in temples while carving out a special category of **‘Agamic temples’.**

### Change and resistance

Over the last few years, Governments of Kerala and Tamil Nadu have appointed hundreds of trained archakas, Odhuvaars and Bhattacharyas from non-Brahmin castes. These have been met with resistance within and outside the courts of law. These reforms challenge orthodox religious beliefs and entrenched social diktats. Nevertheless, the push for reforms is stronger than before. One hundred years after Vaikom and over 75 years since the Constituent Assembly debate on this issue, there is a compelling moral consensus that is emerging. While the Governments of Tamil Nadu and Kerala have collaborated to commemorate the centenary of the Vaikom Struggle on December 12, 2024, they are also celebrating a historic event that brought together two States. They are paying tribute to the start of a social reform trajectory that was made possible due to the coming together of two of the greatest leaders.

> The Vaikom Satyagraha (1924-25) was a pivotal social reform movement in Kerala, challenging caste-based discrimination and seeking temple entry rights for marginalized communities. Led by prominent figures like **Periyar E.V. Ramasamy** from Tamil Nadu and **Mahatma Gandhi**, it symbolized inter-state cooperation and the unity of leaders across ideologies. While Periyar emphasized rationalism and caste annihilation, Gandhi focused on non-violent resistance. The movement's success led to greater awareness of social justice and laid the foundation for anti-caste reforms in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Vaikom remains a testament to the power of collective struggle for equality and the interplay of diverse leadership.

# Chief Justices need longer tenures

In September, Chief Justices were appointed to eight High Courts across India. While a good move, the fact that all of them, with the exception of one, will have very short tenures is unfortunate. This is a persistent problem that calls for urgent remedial action since it affects the institutional effectiveness of the judiciary.

### Short tenures

In fact, one Chief Justice has already completed his tenure. Justice Rajiv Shakdher, who was Chief Justice of the Himachal Pradesh High Court, retired after just 24 days, on October 18. Just as he was settling into his role, he had to attend his farewell. Justice Manmohan, who had been serving as the Acting Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court, was sworn in as Chief Justice on September 29. On December 3, the Union government announced the appointment of Chief Justice Manmohan as a judge of the Supreme Court. Justice Tashi Rabstan will serve a tenure of about six months as Chief Justice of the High Court of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. Justice Suresh Kumar Kait, who was appointed as the Chief Justice of the Madhya Pradesh High Court, has a tenure of about eight months. Justice K.R. Shriram, appointed as Chief Justice of the Madras High Court, will serve a one-year tenure. Justice Indra Prasanna Mukerji, the Chief Justice of the Meghalaya High Court, will also be retiring around the same time as Justice Shriram. Justice Nitin Madhukar Jamdar, Chief Justice of the Kerala High Court, has a tenure of about 15 months. The only judge who is will serve a relatively long tenure of about four years is Justice M.S. Ramachandra Rao, who has been appointed as Chief Justice in Jharkhand.

The Chief Justice of a High Court plays a pivotal role in sustaining the all-round health of the institution. The Chief Justice administers the institution, tracks its financial health, plays an important role in recommending names for judgeship, constitutes various committees to administer the institution, attends to the welfare of the staff of the High Court, takes disciplinary action against erring trial court judges and staff when warranted, arranges for defence of such action before appropriate authorities when questioned, responds to innumerable mundane administrative requests, accepts invitations and participates in various symposia, seminars, and functions that are not necessarily restricted to law, participates in functions organised by the Bar Councils and various advocate associations across the State, and addresses problems related to legal education in the State apart from, of course, discharging the function as the top judicial authority of the State. Clearly, doing all of this in the time available is a daunting task.

High Courts are not compact institutions. Further, the tasks that need the attention of a Chief Justice in a High Court situated in one part of the country could be vastly different from what is required of a Chief Justice in a High Court in another part of the country. To understand each of these institutions in their entirety or even substantially takes time and effort. Most Chief Justices barely understand the requirements of the institution by the time their terms cease.

A lot has been said about the short tenure of Chief Justices. During his farewell speech in 2022, Supreme Court judge Justice L. Nageswara Rao said those elevated as judges to the top court must get a “minimum seven to eight years” in office “if not 10 years”. He said, “It takes them (Chief Justices) 1.5 to two years to understand how the Court functions here because it is completely different from the High Courts.” He added that by the time they settle down, “they are looking at their retirement”. Several Chief Justices who have retired after brief tenures have voiced similar sentiments. This is a similar lament among Chief Justices of the High Courts too. Yet, little attention has been paid to the problem.

### A lesson from the British

It was not so during British rule. Back then, it was a norm for Chief Justices to have long tenures. The Madras High Court came into existence in 1862. When it completed 150 years in 2012, it had completed 85 years as a Court in British India and 65 years as a Court in independent India. The first Chief Justice was Sir Colley Harman Scotland. In 1947, when it had completed 85 years, the Madras High Court had had just 11 Chief Justices. Each of them had enjoyed an average tenure of a little less than eight years. During the Madras High Court’s 150th year celebrations, Justice M.Y. Iqbal was the 35th Chief Justice. So, in 65 years, the Court had had 24 Chief Justices, which means the average tenure of those judges was hardly 2.75 years. The average term reduces further when we deduct the tenures of Chief Justice P.V. Rajamannar, who served a term of 13 years, and Chief Justice Veeraswami K., who had a tenure of about seven years. This means that there were 22 Chief Justices in 45 years, which brings down the average term of each to merely more than over two years.

While the tasks of Chief Justices are only increasing and becoming more complicated, the duration given to them to address these are becoming shorter and shorter. When the system provides such little time for the incumbents to even understand the system, what scope is there for innovation, reform, and improvement?

The attempt here is not to provide prescriptions to the malady. It is to emphasise that the problem needs to be addressed. It can only be resolved by a joint deliberation of stakeholders, including the Bar. It is important that they evolve a solution before the problem seriously affects the system.

### **Chief Justices Need Longer Tenures**

The tenure of Chief Justices in India, particularly of the Supreme Court, has been a matter of debate due to its relatively short duration. Frequent changes in leadership can impact judicial efficiency, long-term reforms, and the continuity of critical decisions. Extending the tenure of Chief Justices could address these challenges and ensure a more effective judiciary.

---

### **Issues with Short Tenures**

1. **Lack of Continuity:**
   - Many Chief Justices serve for less than two years due to the age limit of 65 years. Some serve for only a few months.
   - Short tenures hinder the ability to implement long-term reforms in the judiciary.

2. **Policy Fragmentation:**
   - Initiatives started by one Chief Justice often lack consistent follow-up or are abandoned by successors with different priorities.

3. **Administrative Overload:**
   - Chief Justices have significant administrative responsibilities, including managing court rosters, appointments, and judicial infrastructure.
   - Short tenures leave little time to focus on substantial judicial reforms.

4. **Impact on Judicial Independence:**
   - Frequent changes may lead to excessive focus on immediate issues, leaving less room for structural and institutional strengthening.

---

### **Advantages of Longer Tenures**

1. **Reform Implementation:**
   - Longer tenures allow Chief Justices to implement and oversee crucial reforms in areas like case management, infrastructure, and technology adoption.

2. **Judicial Consistency:**
   - Ensures continuity in judicial philosophy, reducing policy shifts and fostering stability in judicial interpretation.

3. **Better Planning:**
   - Enables more effective planning and execution of long-term goals, such as reducing pendency of cases or improving access to justice.

4. **Enhanced Leadership:**
   - A Chief Justice with a longer tenure can act as a steady leader, strengthening the judiciary's independence and public trust.

---

### **Global Comparison**

- In countries like **the United States**, Chief Justices have life terms or serve until retirement, allowing them to influence judicial administration for decades.
- In contrast, India's system of seniority-based appointments and retirement age often limits the potential tenure of a Chief Justice.

---

### **Proposed Solutions**

1. **Fixed Tenure:**
   - Introduce a fixed term of at least three to five years for Chief Justices, independent of the retirement age.

2. **Age Reform:**
   - Increase the retirement age of judges from 65 to 68, providing more room for longer tenures.

3. **Merit-Based Selection:**
   - Appoint Chief Justices based on merit and leadership qualities rather than solely on seniority.

4. **Collegium Reform:**
   - Streamline the collegium system to ensure transparency and prioritize leadership potential in appointments.

---

### **Challenges to Implementation**

1. **Seniority Convention:**
   - The seniority-based system, deeply ingrained in the judiciary, may resist changes to tenure policies.

2. **Judicial Independence Concerns:**
   - Any changes must avoid politicization of appointments to ensure that longer tenures do not compromise judicial independence.

3. **Legislative Amendments:**
   - Extending tenures would require constitutional amendments, necessitating political consensus.

---

### **Conclusion**

Extending the tenure of Chief Justices is essential for a stable and efficient judiciary. It would allow for better implementation of reforms, enhance leadership, and ensure consistency in judicial decisions. While challenges exist, thoughtful reforms can balance continuity and judicial independence, ultimately strengthening the judiciary’s role as a guardian of constitutional values.

> Short tenures of Chief Justices in India hinder judicial reforms, continuity, and leadership. Frequent changes, due to the seniority-based system and retirement age of 65, limit the ability to implement long-term goals like reducing case pendency and enhancing infrastructure. A longer tenure would ensure consistent judicial philosophy, better planning, and effective reform execution. Solutions include introducing a fixed tenure (3–5 years), increasing judges' retirement age, and merit-based appointments. While reforms may face resistance due to the seniority tradition and legislative hurdles, extending Chief Justices' tenures is vital for judicial stability, efficiency, and strengthening the independence of the judiciary.

# Will go to ‘any extent possible’ to eradicate manual scavenging: SC

### **Eradication of Manual Scavenging: A Supreme Court Initiative**

On Wednesday, the Supreme Court of India reiterated its commitment to ending the inhumane practice of **manual scavenging** and the hazardous cleaning of sewers and septic tanks, emphasizing that the issue pertains to the **fundamental right to dignity** enshrined in the Constitution. Despite legislative measures and judicial interventions, the persistence of this practice highlights a grave violation of human rights and the need for stronger enforcement mechanisms.

---

### **Manual Scavenging in India: An Overview**

**Manual Scavenging** refers to the practice of manually cleaning human excreta from dry latrines, sewers, or septic tanks, often performed by individuals belonging to marginalized communities, particularly Dalits. This dehumanizing occupation is deeply rooted in caste discrimination and perpetuates systemic inequality.

**Key Statistics:**
- According to government data, over **58,000 individuals** are involved in manual scavenging (2021 figures), though activists argue the real numbers are much higher.
- Many manual scavengers lose their lives due to toxic gases while cleaning sewers and septic tanks.

---

### **Legal Framework to Prohibit Manual Scavenging**

India has enacted several laws to eliminate manual scavenging, safeguard workers' dignity, and rehabilitate them:

#### **1. The Employment of Manual Scavengers and Construction of Dry Latrines (Prohibition) Act, 1993:**
   - Prohibited manual scavenging and the construction of dry latrines.
   - Penalized employers with fines or imprisonment for engaging manual scavengers.
   - Criticized for weak implementation and limited scope.

#### **2. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and Their Rehabilitation Act, 2013:**
   - Broadened the definition of manual scavenging to include hazardous cleaning of sewers and septic tanks.
   - Mandated the identification of manual scavengers and their rehabilitation.
   - Stipulated the provision of alternative livelihoods, financial aid, housing, and educational benefits.
   - Imposed penalties, including imprisonment (up to 5 years) and fines for violators.
   - Prohibited manual cleaning of sewers without protective gear or mechanized equipment.

#### **3. The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989:**
   - Criminalizes acts of discrimination, including forced manual scavenging, against SC/ST communities.
   - Provides stringent punishment for violators.

#### **4. Supreme Court Judgment in Safai Karamchari Andolan vs. Union of India (2014):**
   - Directed states to ensure the eradication of manual scavenging.
   - Ordered the rehabilitation of identified manual scavengers and compensation of ₹10 lakhs for sewer death victims.
   - Highlighted the constitutional violations of Article 14 (Equality), Article 17 (Abolition of Untouchability), and Article 21 (Right to Life and Dignity).

---

### **Challenges in Implementation**

Despite strong legal frameworks, the eradication of manual scavenging remains elusive due to:
1. **Lack of Awareness:** Many manual scavengers are unaware of their rights and the provisions for rehabilitation.
2. **Weak Enforcement:** Poor implementation of laws and failure to prosecute violators.
3. **Caste Discrimination:** Deeply entrenched social stigma perpetuates the practice.
4. **Limited Alternatives:** Insufficient provision of alternative livelihoods forces individuals to continue manual scavenging.

---

### **Supreme Court’s Recent Intervention**

The Supreme Court’s statement reflects its resolve to ensure that:
- No person is forced into manual scavenging.
- States comply with existing laws and actively rehabilitate manual scavengers.
- Mechanized cleaning methods replace hazardous manual cleaning of sewers and septic tanks.

The Court emphasized the **right to dignity** as a cornerstone of human rights, urging authorities to act decisively.

---

### **Way Forward**

1. **Technological Advancements:**
   - Promote mechanized cleaning of sewers and septic tanks.
   - Invest in robotics and other technologies to eliminate human involvement in hazardous cleaning.

2. **Community Awareness:**
   - Conduct awareness campaigns to educate manual scavengers about their rights and rehabilitation schemes.
   - Address societal stigma through caste sensitization programs.

3. **Effective Implementation:**
   - Strengthen monitoring mechanisms to ensure compliance with the 2013 Act.
   - Impose stricter penalties for violations.

4. **Rehabilitation and Skill Development:**
   - Provide comprehensive rehabilitation, including alternative employment opportunities, financial support, and vocational training.

5. **Judicial Oversight:**
   - Periodic review by the Supreme Court to ensure states' compliance with its directives and laws.

---

### **Conclusion**

The Supreme Court’s commitment to eradicating manual scavenging is a significant step toward safeguarding human dignity. However, laws alone cannot address the deep-seated social and economic issues that perpetuate this practice. A combination of technological innovation, strict enforcement, and societal reform is essential to ensure that no individual is subjected to such indignity. Achieving this will be a true testament to India's commitment to equality and human rights.

> The Supreme Court has vowed to eliminate manual scavenging and hazardous sewer cleaning, emphasizing its violation of human dignity and constitutional rights under Articles 14, 17, and 21. Despite strong laws like the **2013 Prohibition Act**, manual scavenging persists due to weak enforcement, caste-based discrimination, and lack of alternatives. The court highlighted the need for mechanized cleaning, strict law enforcement, and rehabilitation for affected individuals. Key measures include awareness campaigns, vocational training, and technological adoption to replace human involvement in hazardous tasks. Eradicating this practice is essential to uphold equality, human dignity, and India's commitment to social justice.
