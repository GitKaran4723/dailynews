# Emerging H5N1 mutations raise risk of human infections

### Avian Influenza (Bird Flu): A Growing Global Concern

Avian influenza, commonly referred to as bird flu, is a viral infection primarily affecting birds but with potential implications for other species, including humans. The H5N1 strain of avian influenza has emerged as a particularly severe threat due to its high pathogenicity and ability to infect various hosts, including poultry, wild birds, mammals, and, sporadically, humans. The ongoing global outbreak of H5N1, driven by a new lineage known as 2.3.4.4b, has intensified concerns about the virus’s adaptability and potential to cause a pandemic.

---

### **The Emergence and Spread of H5N1**

The H5N1 virus first appeared in the late 1990s, predominantly affecting poultry. It caused massive economic losses in the poultry industry due to high mortality rates and the need for culling infected flocks. The virus’s ability to infect wild birds has facilitated its spread across continents, as migratory birds act as natural reservoirs and carriers.

The current outbreak, which began in late 2020, is notable for its rapid and widespread transmission. The 2.3.4.4b lineage has been identified as a major driver of this outbreak, affecting birds in North America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. In addition to poultry, wild bird populations have been significantly impacted, raising concerns about biodiversity and ecological imbalances.

---

### **Public Health Concerns**

#### **Human Infections**
While H5N1 primarily infects birds, sporadic human cases have raised alarms about its potential to cause a global health crisis. Human infections typically occur through direct or indirect contact with infected birds or contaminated environments, such as live bird markets. The virus can cause severe respiratory illness in humans, with a high fatality rate.

Recent cases of H5N1 in humans in British Columbia, Canada, and California, USA, have heightened concerns about the virus’s adaptability. These infections suggest that the virus may be undergoing mutations that could enhance its ability to infect humans or facilitate human-to-human transmission.

#### **Pandemic Potential**
The H5N1 virus's potential for human-to-human transmission remains a critical concern. While current human infections are rare and do not involve sustained transmission, the virus's high mutation rate and ability to reassort with other influenza viruses increase the risk of a pandemic. A strain capable of efficient human-to-human transmission could have devastating consequences for global health.

---

### **Impact on Poultry and Wildlife**

The H5N1 virus has devastated the poultry industry worldwide. Infected flocks often require mass culling to prevent further spread, leading to significant economic losses. Additionally, outbreaks among wild birds threaten biodiversity and disrupt ecological systems. The death of large numbers of wild birds could also result in the spread of the virus to new areas.

---

### **Current Mitigation Measures**

Efforts to control the spread of H5N1 include:
1. **Surveillance and Monitoring**: Early detection in poultry and wild birds is critical to containing outbreaks.
2. **Biosecurity Measures**: Poultry farms are implementing stricter hygiene protocols to prevent infections.
3. **Vaccination**: Vaccines are available for poultry, although their use is often limited by logistical challenges and concerns about efficacy.
4. **Public Awareness**: Educating people about safe poultry handling practices is essential to reduce the risk of human infections.

---

### **Future Outlook and Challenges**

The global spread of H5N1 highlights the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health. Efforts to combat the virus must adopt a **One Health** approach, integrating human, animal, and environmental health disciplines. Research into vaccines and antiviral treatments for humans is ongoing, but challenges remain in terms of production, distribution, and accessibility.

The possibility of mutations enabling human-to-human transmission underscores the need for global preparedness. This includes strengthening healthcare systems, stockpiling antiviral medications, and developing rapid-response plans for potential outbreaks.

---

### **Conclusion**

Avian influenza, particularly the H5N1 strain, represents a persistent threat to global health, the poultry industry, and wildlife. While current outbreaks are largely limited to birds, sporadic human cases and the virus’s ability to mutate raise concerns about its pandemic potential. A coordinated global effort, combining surveillance, research, and public health measures, is crucial to mitigate the risks posed by H5N1 and ensure preparedness for future challenges.

> Avian influenza (bird flu), caused by the H5N1 virus, primarily affects birds but has significant implications for humans and other species. The ongoing global outbreak, driven by the 2.3.4.4b lineage, has spread rapidly since 2020, impacting poultry, wild birds, and biodiversity. Sporadic human cases in Canada and the U.S. have raised concerns about potential mutations enabling human-to-human transmission, increasing its pandemic risk. The virus has devastated the poultry industry, requiring mass culling and stringent biosecurity measures. Mitigation efforts include surveillance, vaccination, and public awareness. A global, coordinated "One Health" approach is vital to manage the virus and prevent future pandemics.

# How will bribery charges impact Adani?

Last week, the U.S. Department of Justice charged two officials of a renewable energy company listed in the U.S. in connection with a bribery scheme allegedly perpetrated by Gautam Adani, chairman of the Adani Group, and his associates including his nephew Sagar Adani. Several officials of an Adani Group company have been accused of bribing government officials in various Indian States to receive business favours.

### What followed the revelations?

Shares of various Adani Group companies dropped sharply; they have recovered most of their losses in the last week after Adani Green Energy Ltd. (AGEL) filed its first response to stock exchanges, denying the bribery charges pressed by the American market regulator. The Adani Group has claimed that the allegations of bribery cost the group’s listed companies a loss of $55 billion in market value. The conglomerate had notably lost more than $150 billion in market value last year after fraud allegations made by U.S. short-seller Hindenburg Research.

### Are lenders likely to review plans?

The latest bribery allegations are likely to make it harder for the Adani Group to raise funds from overseas investors, which means the company may have to rely more on domestic investors for its financing needs. Local lenders, including Indian banks that currently lend to the Adani Group, too may review their exposure to the group. The State Bank of India, which is the largest lender to the Adani Group among Indian banks, is exposed with loans worth ₹33,800 crore. While this represents less than 1% of the bank’s total loan book, a Reuters report on Thursday contended that SBI has said it will be cautious about disbursals to the Adani Group.

### How have rating agencies responded?

Fitch Ratings, Moody’s and S&P Global took negative rating actions on Adani firms this week. As The Hindu reported, citing governance risks for its rating action, Moody’s said there could be a broader credit impact from AGEL’s crisis on group firms “given Gautam Adani’s prominent role as chairman of each of the rated entities or their parent companies as well as the controlling shareholder.” Fitch Ratings also took negative rating actions on the Adani Group’s infrastructure entities. S&P Global Ratings lowered its outlook on three Adani Group entities to negative, pointing at risks to funding access following the U.S. indictment.

### What are the allegations?

The U.S. DOJ alleges that the AGEL promoter and senior officials paid bribes worth $265 million to officials in Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, and Jammu and Kashmir for the sale of renewable energy produced by AGEL. It is alleged that these bribes were paid so that State power distribution companies (DISCOMS) would purchase eight gigawatts worth of energy from AGEL’s renewable energy project. AGEL had won the right to sell renewable energy to interested buyers through the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI), a public sector unit owned by the Centre. It is alleged that DISCOMS were unwilling to purchase power from AGEL due to the high price quoted, and hence bribes were paid by Adani Group officials to prod State government officials to purchase power at prices favourable to the Adani Group. Azure Power Energy Ltd., a New Delhi-headquartered energy company that is listed in the U.S. and whose officials have been indicted for bribery by the DOJ, is also alleged to have colluded with AGEL officials to bribe State officials.

### What are the implications?

Allegations against AGEL officials could lead to higher cost of capital for the Group and also affect its profitability. However, the allegations may have no impact if lenders were already implicitly aware of potential corrupt practices and factored this in while making their lending decisions. The charges against AGEL have also raised doubts about the Centre’s policy goal of boosting the nation’s renewable energy capacity to 500 gigawatts by 2030. The Centre has been prodding State governments to increase renewable energy adoption through Renewable Purchase Obligations which obligate States to purchase a certain minimum amount of their power from renewable energy sources. But State DISCOMS have been reluctant to follow the mandate as they are already financially burdened and lack the infrastructure to source and distribute renewable energy. Some analysts also note that governments often renege on their guarantee to purchase energy from renewable energy companies. Some of the companies resort to illegal means, including bribery, to sell power.

> The recent U.S. indictment of Gautam Adani and associates for allegedly orchestrating a $265 million bribery scheme to secure solar energy contracts has significantly impacted the Adani Group. The conglomerate's market value plummeted by approximately $33 billion, and key partners, such as France's TotalEnergies, have paused investments.  International projects, including those in Kenya, have been canceled, and financial institutions are reassessing their involvement with the group. The Indian government has distanced itself from the issue, while opposition parties demand thorough investigations.  These developments pose substantial challenges to the Adani Group's operations and reputation.
