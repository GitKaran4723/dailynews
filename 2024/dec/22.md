# What are India’s plans for a quantum satellite?

On December 13, Ajai Chowdhry, chairman of the Mission Governing Board of the National Quantum Mission, said India plans to launch a quantum satellite in “2-3 years for quantum communications”.

What is the National Quantum Mission?

The National Quantum Mission (NQM) is a Department of Science & Technology programme to accelerate the use of quantum physics to develop advanced communications and sensing systems.

The development of computers changed the course of human history from the mid-20th century onwards. Advances in this sector gave humankind satellites, telecommunications, weather forecasts, drug-discovery programmes, etc.

But these advances are reaching a saturation point because the physics phenomena on which they are based, called classical physics, are hitting a performance upper-limit. So scientists around the world are developing new technologies to solve the same problems but using phenomena of quantum physics. Because the rules of quantum physics allow for the outcomes of classical physics as well as new ‘bonus’ ones, the new devices are expected to be more versatile problem-solvers.

The Union Cabinet approved the NQM in April 2023 at ₹6,000 crore, to be implemented from 2023 to 2031. The planned quantum satellite is part of this package.

What is a quantum satellite?

A quantum satellite is a term for a communications satellite that uses quantum physics to secure its signals.

Communications is a broad term that refers to technologies that send and receive signals. An important part of these technologies is security: preventing bad actors from intercepting a message being transmitted across large distances, through multiple networks.

The advent of quantum computers threatens the technologies currently being used to secure messages. Fortunately, quantum physics has also paved the way for new forms of protection, and quantum satellites are expected to facilitate them.

How are messages secured?

Say two people, Anil and Selvi, are standing at two ends of a playground and wish to speak to each other. They could shout or wave their hands. However, Anil composes his message, encrypts it, and writes the encrypted text on a piece of paper. He ties it to the foot of a messenger pigeon and sends it to Selvi. If Selvi knows how Anil encrypted the message, she can decrypt it to access the original text.

Encryption is the task of concealing information. The manner is called the cipher. A simple example is the Caesar cipher, where the letters of the alphabet are offset by a fixed number. If the number is 5, the words BIRDS FLY AWAY become GNWIX KQD FBFD.

Say there is a third person, Kaushik, standing in the middle of the ground and trying to eavesdrop on the conversation. If he intercepts the pigeon, he can’t crack the text unless he knows the manner of encryption.

This security paradigm is called cryptographic security. It works by hiding the secret code, or key, behind an extremely difficult mathematical problem. A bad actor like Kaushik can solve the problem with a powerful computer to reveal the code — but the harder the problem, the more time (and/or more computing resources) he will need.

Even the most powerful supercomputers have difficulty cracking the best Advanced Encryption Standard ciphers in use today — but quantum computers may be able to do better.

How can quantum physics protect messages?

Quantum cryptography uses the tenets of quantum physics to secure messages. Its most famous type is quantum key distribution (QKD).

In the example before, Anil used a key to encrypt his message and Selvi, who knew the key, used it to decrypt the message. QKD is concerned with sharing this key with both Anil and Selvi such that if Kaushik is eavesdropping on the transmission, everyone will find out and the sharing will be aborted.

Quantum physics can protect against eavesdropping in different ways. One is quantum measurement — the act of measuring the properties of a quantum system, like a photon (the particle of light). According to the rules of quantum physics, a quantum measurement changes the state of the system. If information about the key is encoded in a stream of photons and Kaushik traps and measures them to look for it, the state of the photons will change and Anil and Selvi will know the key has been compromised.

Another way is to use quantum entanglement: when two photons are entangled, any change to one particle will instantaneously change the other. (This is a simplistic description.)

Has QKD been implemented?

Ravindra Pratap Singh of the Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad, wrote in 2023 that standards for different QKD implementations are still a decade away. This said, China currently operates the world’s largest QKD network with three quantum satellites and four ground stations.

Experts are also trying to implement QKD across longer distances. Since the early 1990s, the distance of reliable transmissions has increased to several hundred kilometres, either through fibre-optic cables or free space.

In an October 2024 study, researchers at the Raman Research Institute, Bengaluru, reported the Indian Astronomical Observatory in Hanle, Ladakh, offers the best atmospheric conditions through which to transmit data for a satellite-based QKD system. The paper’s lead author Satya Ranjan Behera said the beam distance would be 500 km.

Does QKD have drawbacks?

QKD on paper can be different from that in the real-world. This is why the U.S. National Security Agency has recommended the use of post-quantum cryptography rather than quantum cryptography. Its criticism is focused on five technical limitations: “QKD does not provide a means to authenticate the QKD transmission source”; “since QKD is hardware-based”, QKD networks can’t be upgraded or patched easily; “QKD increases infrastructure costs and insider threat risks” that “eliminate many use cases from consideration”; “the actual security provided by a QKD system is not the theoretical unconditional security from the laws of physics... but rather the more limited security that can be achieved by hardware and engineering designs”; and since eavesdroppers can cause a transmission to stop, they can deny the use of a transmission by its intended users (a.k.a. a denial-of-service attack).

The no-cloning theorem of quantum physics also disallows quantum information from being amplified to compensate for losses during transmission.

India is actively working on developing its first **quantum communication satellite**, a cutting-edge initiative aimed at enhancing secure communication infrastructure and advancing its technological capabilities in the quantum realm.
