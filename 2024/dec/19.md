# Making affordable generics more reliable

Generic drugs are crucial for addressing healthcare affordability in a population marked by significant income disparities. Bioequivalent to branded drugs, generics offer cost-effective alternatives. India leverages economies of scale and low production costs to supply affordable medication domestically and internationally.

With **out-of-pocket healthcare expenditure** at **39.4%** of total health expenditure in 2021-22, generics reduce financial burdens and improve treatment adherence. By August 2024, generic medicines worth₹5,600 crore sold through **Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana** over a decade saved consumers an estimated ₹30,000 crore.

Ensuring the quality of generic medicines in India is vital to make them affordable and effective as innovator drugs. Despite being bioequivalent to brand-name drugs, quality control lapses have occasionally compromised their efficacy and safety.

A study by doctors of the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, published in Mycoses, investigated the efficacy of itraconazole in treating chronic pulmonary aspergillosis using the innovator drug and 22 generic formulations. The innovator itraconazole achieved therapeutic drug levels in 73% of patients within two weeks, compared to only 29% for generics, which often required 6–8 weeks, dose escalation, or switching to the innovator. Further, generic capsules had significant defects, including fewer and unevenly sized pellets, critical for optimal drug absorption and bioavailability.

### But why do generic and innovator drugs differ in some cases despite being made from the same active ingredient? 
Generics can differ significantly in their excipients and manufacturing processes, leading to variability in therapeutic outcomes. First, differences in excipients — such as binders, fillers, disintegrants, and coatings — can alter a drug’s dissolution rate, stability, and delivery mechanism.

Second, manufacturing processes, including the type of punching machines, compression force, and granulation methods, can influence the drug’s physical and chemical properties. Variations in tablet hardness, particle size, and porosity can affect disintegration and absorption. In some cases, while an innovator drug is designed to release the API slowly to achieve a sustained therapeutic effect, generics may release the API more rapidly, potentially leading to fluctuations in drug levels.

Third, the limitations of bioequivalence thresholds contribute to the problem. Regulatory standards often allow pharmacokinetic parameters to fall within 80%–125% of the innovator drug’s range. These thresholds may be insufficient for medications with a narrow therapeutic index. Even minor deviations in drug release or bioavailability can lead to subtherapeutic effects or adverse reactions. Stability issues can also further undermine the drug’s shelf life and reliability.

The key issue lies in India’s decentralised drug regulation system, which grants significant authority to State Drug Regulatory Authorities (SDRAs), leading to inconsistent enforcement and quality standards. The Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) can only recommend action, leaving States to act. Despite repeated calls for centralisation, crucial functions remain with States, enabling regulatory arbitrage as manufacturers exploit weaker oversight. India must centralise drug regulation, strengthen CDSCO with resources and personnel, and establish more central drug-testing labs to address this issue.

Another reason is the inadequate enforcement of stability testing to ensure drug efficacy under diverse climatic conditions. Stability testing, mandated by the CDSCO in 2018, requires manufacturers to demonstrate that drugs maintain their quality, strength, and identity under specified conditions. However, inconsistent implementation by State licensing authorities and the absence of clear, centralised guidelines undermine compliance. Moreover, the lack of retrospective applicability to generics approved before 2018 perpetuates the presence of substandard drugs in the market. India must enforce uniform stability testing protocols, ensure centralised regulatory oversight, and mandate periodic reassessment of all approved generics to build confidence in drug quality.

Thirdly, India’s Pharmacopoeia permits higher drug impurity levels than U.S. and EU standards. The Pharmacopoeia Commission (PC) and CDSCO rejected stricter ICH guidelines as “too expensive”. Thus, these standards should be made a bit more stringent. In that case, action needs to be taken at the level of PC, CDCSO, and Centre.

Centralising drug regulation will only be effective with a comprehensive overhaul of the CDSCO. It must be reorganised to deliver robust regulatory safeguards, protecting patients from the dangers of substandard and counterfeit medicines through stringent regulatory protocols and effective inspection and enforcement mechanisms.

We must champion generics — they are indispensable for ensuring equitable access to medicines. But, equity cannot come at the expense of quality. States must relinquish their fragmented control over drug regulation, which has long undermined public confidence in generics. It is time to act on the decades-old recommendations of the Bhatia (1954), Hathi (1975), and Mashelkar (2003) committees, all of which have called for centralised oversight.

> Ensuring the reliability of affordable generic medicines requires stringent quality control, regulatory oversight, and transparency in manufacturing processes. Generic drugs are essential for providing cost-effective healthcare, but concerns over their quality can hinder their acceptance. Strengthening regulatory frameworks, encouraging innovation in production, and adopting global best practices can enhance trust in generics. Increased investment in research, quality testing, and capacity-building for manufacturers can ensure safety and efficacy. Collaboration between governments, healthcare providers, and the pharmaceutical industry is crucial for improving access to reliable generics, ultimately reducing healthcare costs and improving health outcomes globally.

# Strengthening the roots of an agri-carbon market

Carbon markets hold the potential to transform Indian agriculture, turning sustainable farming practices into a lucrative opportunity for farmers while combating climate change. In this, carbon pricing is a critical tool for mitigating climate change. It functions through compliance and voluntary carbon markets. Compliance markets, regulated by governments or international bodies such as the United Nations, impose emissions caps on companies. Businesses exceeding these caps must either purchase carbon credits from projects that mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, such as agroforestry or sustainable agriculture projects, or pay carbon taxes for their extra emissions. In contrast, the voluntary carbon market operates without regulation, allowing organisations to trade carbon credits through mechanisms such as the Clean Development Mechanism, Verra, and Gold Standard, among others. Together, these systems aim to reduce GHG emissions and support global climate goals.

### Carbon markets, their working

Carbon markets are gaining momentum. At COP29, in November 2024, for instance, a centralised carbon market under the UN got a green signal. Last year, India announced that it would launch its own compliance and voluntary carbon markets. Recently, the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development, in collaboration with the Indian Council of Agricultural Research and State universities, listed five agriculture carbon credit projects in Verra.

Carbon markets rely on two key principles: additionality and permanence. Additionality ensures emission reductions happen only due to carbon credits, requiring farmers to adopt new practices. This means that those who already use sustainable methods are not eligible for credits. Permanence refers to the long-term durability of these benefits. Permanence guarantees these benefits last, such as ensuring carbon stored in soils through reduced tillage is not lost due to a return to conventional ploughing. Therefore, projects that aim to generate and trade carbon credits must adhere to certain conditions, including additionality and permanence.

To assess the readiness of India’s agriculture sector for a full-scale carbon market, we must examine the existing carbon credit projects listed under non-governmental entities such as Verra. This highlights challenges and the necessary fixes before scaling up. If projects fail to deliver promised environmental benefits, producing unreliable credits, buyers may lose confidence and stop purchasing agriculture carbon credits. This deprives farmers of extra income and discourages the adoption of sustainable practices. Ensuring high-quality credits from the start of Indian carbon markets is crucial for trust and long-term farmer participation.

In just four years, over 50 agriculture carbon farming projects have been listed in the Verra registry, targeting 1.6 million hectares of farmland in India. These projects aim to generate approximately 4.7 million carbon credits annually, equivalent to offsetting the GHG emitted from 11 billion miles driven by an average gasoline-powered vehicle. However, none of these projects is registered, which means carbon credits have not been issued and that farmers have not received the money.

### Carbon farming projects in India

A recent study by the writers of this article published in Climate Policy — “Carbon farming in India: are the existing projects inclusive, additional, and permanent?” — examines seven such carbon farming projects in Haryana and Madhya Pradesh, focusing on socio-economic inclusiveness, additionality, and permanence. The findings show that marginalised communities and small farmers were largely excluded, with women making up only 4% of participants. Carbon farmers in these States cultivated significantly more land — 51% more in Haryana and 32% more in Madhya Pradesh — than non-carbon farmers. Among non-carbon farmers, 46% of the land was owned by non-marginalised castes (general castes) and 17% by Scheduled Caste-Scheduled Tribe (SC/ST) farmers, whereas among carbon farmers, 63% of the land was under non-marginalised castes and only 13% was owned by SC/ST farmers.

Further, while some sustainable practices were already in place before the projects began, others such as zero tillage, alternate wetting and drying, intercropping, reduced chemical fertilizer use, micro-irrigation, and tree planting were newly adopted, which satisfies the additionality condition. This demonstrates that, when implemented effectively, these projects can genuinely reduce GHG emissions.

Significant challenges remain in these projects: 45% of farmers reported no communication, over 60% lacked training in new techniques, and 28% stopped sustainable practices by the second year, mainly due to insufficient financial incentives. Alarmingly, 99% had not received carbon credit payments, with additional issues including yield penalties and inadequate information on carbon farming.

Despite these setbacks, projects managed by startups focused solely on carbon credits, termed “Carbon Core” in this study, performed better than those run by subsidiaries or offshoots of larger corporations. However, these projects were less inclusive of smallholders and marginalised communities.

To address these issues, India’s carbon market must incentivise socially inclusive projects by offering higher prices for carbon credits from projects that include smallholders and marginalised communities. Effective communication, regular training, and guaranteed, timely payments can enhance farmer participation. Collaborating with national and international research institutions to target suitable regions and interventions can prevent yield penalties and protect food security.

### An improving science

The science of measuring soil carbon and GHG emissions is expected to improve over time. In recent years, digital technologies have advanced significantly. Tools such as remote sensing, satellite imagery, drones, and sensors for monitoring project activities will soon become more accessible. However, for carbon markets to succeed, the critical focus must be addressing the grand old implementation challenges.

Building a thriving agricultural carbon market in India requires collaboration among policymakers, researchers, and private entities to ensure inclusivity, transparency, timely rewards for farmers, and improved project implementation.

> An **agri-carbon market** aims to incentivize sustainable agricultural practices that capture and store carbon, helping combat climate change. Strengthening its foundation involves creating robust frameworks for measuring, reporting, and verifying carbon sequestration in agriculture. Farmers must be educated and provided financial support to adopt eco-friendly practices like no-till farming, crop rotation, and agroforestry. Collaboration between governments, private sectors, and research institutions is essential to standardize carbon credits and ensure fair pricing. A well-developed agri-carbon market can promote sustainability, provide additional income for farmers, and contribute significantly to global carbon reduction goals while supporting rural development and ecological balance.
