# Daily prayers at temple in Chikkamagaluru village stopped

### **Impact on Society**
The exclusion of Scheduled Caste (SC) individuals from temples reflects deep-seated caste discrimination, contradicting India's constitutional ideals of equality and social justice. Such incidents have profound social implications:

1. **Social Polarization**: Discrimination deepens societal divides and fosters resentment among marginalized communities.
2. **Violation of Human Rights**: Exclusion undermines basic human dignity and the right to worship, perpetuating inequality.
3. **Hindrance to Progress**: Such acts reinforce outdated caste hierarchies, impeding India's journey toward an egalitarian society.
4. **Erosion of Faith in Institutions**: Discrimination in sacred spaces can weaken people's trust in religious and social institutions.
5. **Catalyst for Movements**: Such incidents often reignite calls for social reform, as seen during the Temple Entry Movement.

---

### **Temple Entry Movement**
The Temple Entry Movement was a significant social reform effort during the colonial and post-independence periods, aimed at eliminating caste-based discrimination in places of worship.

#### **Key Aspects of the Movement**
1. **Historical Background**:
   - For centuries, Scheduled Castes (then called "untouchables") were denied entry into Hindu temples due to caste-based prejudices.
   - This exclusion symbolized the broader social ostracism faced by marginalized communities.

2. **Notable Movements**:
   - **Vaikom Satyagraha (1924-25)**: Initiated in Kerala, this protest sought to allow Dalits access to roads surrounding the Vaikom Temple. It became a landmark struggle against caste discrimination.
   - **Guruvayur Satyagraha (1931-32)**: Focused on the Guruvayur Temple in Kerala, it aimed to open temple doors to all Hindus.
   - **Mahatma Gandhi’s Role**: Gandhi championed the cause, advocating for the abolition of untouchability and emphasizing temple access as a means of achieving equality.
   - **Temple Entry Proclamation (1936)**: Issued by the Maharaja of Travancore, it allowed Dalits access to temples in Travancore, marking a turning point in the movement.

3. **Impact**:
   - These movements challenged orthodox beliefs and paved the way for caste reform.
   - They highlighted the necessity of legal and social measures to ensure equality.

---

### **Constitutional Provisions Related to Temple Entry**
The Indian Constitution upholds the principles of equality, social justice, and religious freedom. Several Articles address issues of caste discrimination and ensure the rights of Scheduled Castes:

1. **Article 14 (Equality Before the Law)**:
   - Guarantees that all individuals are equal before the law and are entitled to equal protection.

2. **Article 15 (Prohibition of Discrimination)**:
   - Prohibits discrimination based on religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth.
   - Specifically includes access to public spaces, including temples.

3. **Article 17 (Abolition of Untouchability)**:
   - Abolishes untouchability in all forms and declares its practice a punishable offense.

4. **Article 25 (Freedom of Religion)**:
   - Ensures the right to freely profess, practice, and propagate religion, subject to public order, morality, and health.
   - Explicitly allows for social reform and the opening of Hindu religious institutions to all classes and sections of Hindus.

5. **Article 21 (Right to Life and Personal Liberty)**:
   - Ensures a dignified life, which includes the right to participate in cultural and religious activities.

6. **Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955**:
   - Enacted to supplement Article 17, it penalizes discrimination and denial of access to public places, including temples.

---

### **Conclusion**
The denial of temple entry to SC individuals is a stark reminder of persisting caste-based inequalities. While constitutional provisions and historical movements like the Temple Entry Movement have significantly improved access and rights, such incidents call for renewed efforts to enforce legal safeguards, foster societal awareness, and promote inclusivity. Ensuring temple access for all is not just a matter of legal compliance but a step toward achieving the Constitutional vision of equality and dignity for every Indian.

> The exclusion of Scheduled Caste individuals from temples perpetuates caste discrimination, deepens social divides, and undermines constitutional values of equality and dignity. Historical movements like the **Temple Entry Movement**, including the **Vaikom Satyagraha** and **Temple Entry Proclamation (1936)**, challenged such practices and advanced social reform. Constitutional provisions such as **Article 14 (Equality Before Law)**, **Article 15 (Prohibition of Discrimination)**, **Article 17 (Abolition of Untouchability)**, and **Article 25 (Freedom of Religion)** ensure equality and the right to worship. Despite these safeguards, incidents of exclusion demand stricter enforcement, societal awareness, and inclusivity to achieve the constitutional vision of justice and equality for all.

# A three-nation visit as a foray into summit diplomacy

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Nigeria, Brazil, and Guyana (November 16-21, 2024) was exceptionally well designed to achieve multiple objectives. It was India’s latest foray into summit diplomacy covering three different geographic regions — Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean — and encompassed an extensive interaction on bilateral, regional and global issues. While the Prime Minister’s primary purpose was to represent India at the nineteenth summit of the Group of 20 (G-20), in Brazil, his spending ample time in the two other countries enhanced the impact of this trans-continental journey. A close look at how the visit unfolded, and its outcome, is an index to understanding India’s current foreign policy priorities.

### Nigeria, the first leg

The halt at Abuja, Nigeria, was not a pit stop. It was a full-scale state visit to Africa’s most populous nation and the fourth-largest economy. This West African nation’s international heft has been increasing, as evidenced by its presence at the G-20 summit last year at India’s invitation and the BRICS’ invitation to join it as a partner state. Nigeria’s recent chairship of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) is relevant too. As two large democracies and multi-religious, multi-ethnic, and multi-linguistic societies devoted to ‘unity in diversity’, India and Nigeria are natural partners.

The Nigerian leadership gave ample signals to convey its appreciation of India’s expanding economic and political influence and its robust Africa policy. The formal gifting of the keys of the city of Abuja to Mr. Modi, the ceremonial welcome at the State House complete with a 21-gun salute, and the conferment of a top national award were clear giveaways. The award citation referred to his leadership and stellar contribution to fostering India-Nigeria ties and noted that India has been positioned as a global powerhouse under his transformative governance.

Nigeria, an important beneficiary of India’s development assistance and human-resource development-related programmes, has been keen to advance the ‘strategic partnership’. India seemed ready and willing. The dialogue at Abuja confirmed the two leaders’ assessment that much potential existed for expanding bilateral cooperation in trade, investment, education, energy, health, culture, and people-to-people ties. New areas such as agriculture, urban transportation, renewable energy, and digital transformation were identified. Besides, they renewed their commitment to joint combat against terrorism, extremism, and radicalisation. Despite closeness at the political level, only three memoranda of understanding (MoU) were signed due probably to bureaucratic delays on the host side. Overall, the visit was a clear plus for the India-Nigeria friendship.

### G-20, the centrepiece in Brazil

The nineteenth summit of G-20, comprising 19 powerful economies and two regional organisations, was hosted in Rio de Janeiro (November 18–19). It took forward the people-centric decisions adopted at the New Delhi summit by mainstreaming key perspectives of the Global South into the G-20 decision-making. The Rio Declaration highlighted the three priorities defined by the Brazilian presidency: social inclusion, sustainable development and reform of global governance institutions.

On the first issue, the Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty was launched. It will serve as a platform for “mobilizing finance and knowledge sharing” on a wide scale. Regarding sustainable development, the G-20 reiterated its previous positions but failed to make headway on climate finance. On the third issue, the new achievement was the adoption of the road map for “Better, Bigger and more Effective Multilateral Development Banks”, with the group calling for its early implementation. On the United Nations and World Trade Organization (WTO) reform, there was nothing new in the G-20’s pronouncements.

As conflicts rage in Europe and West Asia, leaders sought peaceful resolution and focused attention on the significant issues of economic development and climate change. While experts debated what the G-20 summit achieved, many expressed the view that it was time for the group to concentrate on implementing its decisions.

The Rio summit provided many opportunities for leaders to interact in the plenary hall and on the sidelines. Mr. Modi met several leaders, notably from the United States, Europe, and the Global South countries. The Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar met his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi to devise the next stage of the India-China rapprochement.

### Guyana, as the wrap up

On the third leg, Mr. Modi travelled to Guyana, a nation of fewer than one million people in the Caribbean region. Its importance came into focus: 40% of the population is of Indian origin, a robust bilateral cooperation programme exists, Guyana has energy resources and is an important player in regional affairs. Decisions were announced to expand cooperation in diverse sectors such as energy, defence, urban development, digital collaboration, education, and food security as 10 MOUs were signed.

India and the Caribbean Community held their second summit in Georgetown, Guyana. This enabled Mr. Modi to interact with about a dozen leaders of this successful regional body. He proposed seven pillars to deepen cooperation, covering capacity building, agriculture and food security, renewable energy and climate change, innovation, technology and trade, cricket and culture, ocean economy, and medicine and health. The commonality in these pillars, he told them, was that they were all based on “your priorities and needs”.

In sum, the Prime Minister’s visit packed a lot within six days. It contributed to enhancing India’s global standing and Mr. Modi’s image and popularity abroad. Guyana’s President Irfaan Ali hailed him as “a champion among leaders” who has “led incredibly”. Through the expeditious implementation of the decisions announced, New Delhi could optimise the outcomes of this bold essay in diplomacy.

> A three-nation visit signifies a strategic effort to strengthen bilateral and multilateral ties through summit diplomacy. Such visits focus on key areas like trade, defense, technology, and climate cooperation, while also addressing regional and global challenges. Summit diplomacy allows leaders to engage in direct dialogue, build trust, and negotiate agreements that promote mutual interests. It showcases a nation's geopolitical intent, enhances its global presence, and fosters partnerships in critical sectors. These visits often include participation in international summits, bilateral meetings, and cultural exchanges, emphasizing diplomacy as a tool for advancing national priorities and addressing shared global concerns.

# States and the challenge before the Finance Commission

The Government of Tamil Nadu recently hosted the Sixteenth Finance Commission, which was chaired by Arvind Panagariya. With its distinguished experts from various fields, the Commission is uniquely positioned to address the critical fiscal challenges facing India and rectifying the skewness in the relationship between the States and the Union.

### Opportunities from global changes

The decisions taken by this Finance Commission will not only shape the fiscal fate of the nation for the next five years but will also influence India’s economic trajectory in the decades to come. The Sixteenth Finance Commission’s work coincides with significant shifts in global economic trends. Concepts such as “friendshoring” and “reshoring” are reshaping international trade and investment patterns. These trends present a unique opportunity for India and Tamil Nadu. To seize these opportunities, the critical challenge for the Finance Commission lies in striking a balance between equitable redistribution and incentivising growth in high-performing States such as Tamil Nadu.

Since 1951, when the first Finance Commission was formed, each Finance Commission has adapted its own approach towards the fiscal challenges of its time. Every Commission has sought to achieve an equitable redistribution of resources by increasing the share of States under vertical devolution and channelling funds to less-developed States through horizontal devolution.

But there have been clear gaps between their declared objectives and outcomes; therein lies our case for a new and fair system of distribution of resources. For instance, while the Fifteenth Finance Commission awarded the vertical share of the divisible pool to the States as 41%, the effective devolution to States in the first four years of the award period amounted to only 33.16% of the Union’s gross tax revenue. The unprecedented levying of cess and surcharges by the Union is the fundamental reason for this effective decline in devolution.

### Hike States’ share, incentivise performers

The States, which are near to people, bear substantial developmental expenditures, and, hence, their share should be further increased substantially. The financial strain on the States has been particularly severe due to increases in counterpart funding for centrally sponsored schemes on the one side and inadequate devolution on the other side. Hence, a fair and equitable share for States would be 50% devolution of the gross central taxes, allowing States greater fiscal autonomy in funding and implementing locally relevant schemes.

On horizontal devolution, it is evident that the redistribution policy followed for the first four and a half decades in our country has yielded limited results in driving real growth. Hence, the fundamental question would be this: should the focus be on a smaller national pie with a larger share for less-developed States or a larger national pie with equitable distribution that provides greater absolute resources for all? The answer is difficult, yet a more balanced approach would ensure a larger national economic pie, allowing for reasonable shares for less-developed States and adequate resources for progressive States to continue their upward trajectory. This would clearly necessitate a progressive resource allocation methodology for the performing States so as to allow them to fulfil their potential to be India’s growth engines.

### Unique challenges in progressive States

Amidst this, it is also important to note that progressive States such as Tamil Nadu also face unique challenges in demography and urbanisation. With a median age higher than the national average, the State’s capacity to generate consumption-based tax revenue is declining, even as the costs of supporting an aging population are rising. It is imperative to ensure that such States do not fall into the “middle-income trap”, where growth stagnates and they “grow old before becoming rich”. Next, the challenges due to urbanisation in fast-growing States merit adequate addressal. A State like Tamil Nadu is witnessing the fastest rate of urbanisation in the country, due to which it will have a 57.30% urban population in 2031, against the expected national average of 37.90%. The resources for fulfilling the infrastructure needs of urbanisation should be earmarked to ensure the long-term sustainability of our growth.

We should keep in mind that the mandate of the Commission goes beyond fiscal arithmetic. It is about envisioning a future where every State contributes to and benefits from the nation’s progress. Whether it is fostering manufacturing, addressing urbanisation challenges, or ensuring climate resilience, the Commission’s decisions will impact millions of lives and determine the trajectory of the country’s destiny, to take its place among the world’s leading economies.

> The **Finance Commission of India**, established under **Article 280** of the Constitution, is a constitutional body responsible for recommending the distribution of financial resources between the **Centre and States**. Constituted every **five years**, it advises on:
1. **Tax revenue sharing** between the Centre and States.
2. **Grants-in-aid** to states.
3. Measures to improve the financial stability of states.

It considers factors like population, income, area, and fiscal performance. Recent commissions have also addressed GST implementation and disaster relief funding. By ensuring equitable resource allocation, the Finance Commission strengthens fiscal federalism and promotes balanced economic development across India.

# Uproar in House over Hindi names for Bills

The issue of naming new laws in Hindi and Sanskrit, as raised by opposition MPs, highlights broader concerns about linguistic inclusivity, cultural diversity, and Constitutional compliance in India's legislative process. Addressing these concerns requires a balanced approach that respects India's linguistic plurality while ensuring that laws are accessible and understandable to all citizens.

### **1. Context and Concerns**
India is a linguistically diverse country with 22 scheduled languages and hundreds of regional languages spoken across its states. While Hindi is widely spoken and has the status of an official language along with English, many regions, especially in South India, Northeast, and parts of East India, primarily use other languages for official and daily communication. The opposition's concerns about "Hindi imposition" stem from fears that naming laws predominantly in Hindi and Sanskrit could marginalize non-Hindi-speaking populations and undermine India's linguistic diversity.

The Constitution of India promotes the equality of all languages in the Eighth Schedule and emphasizes the use of English for national communication in addition to Hindi. Article 348 specifies that laws, Supreme Court judgments, and Parliamentary proceedings should be conducted or translated in English for wider accessibility.

### **2. Challenges of Exclusivity**
- **Lack of Accessibility**: Naming laws solely in Hindi and Sanskrit may create barriers for non-Hindi speakers in understanding and engaging with the legislative process.
- **Perception of Cultural Bias**: The dominance of one language in official contexts may be perceived as favoritism, leading to alienation and resentment among linguistic minorities.
- **Constitutional Requirements**: The government's actions may be seen as contravening the spirit of linguistic inclusivity enshrined in the Constitution.

### **3. Suggestions for Resolution**
To address these concerns, a multi-pronged approach can be implemented:

#### **a. Inclusive Language Policies**
- **Bilingual and Multilingual Naming**: Laws could be named in Hindi, English, and regional languages. For example, the primary name could be in English for universal accessibility, with equivalents in Hindi and regional languages for local contexts.
- **Linguistic Representation**: The drafting process could involve committees with representatives from diverse linguistic backgrounds to ensure fair representation and naming conventions.

#### **b. Digital Solutions**
- **Translation and Dissemination**: Use technology to provide translations of laws in all 22 scheduled languages. Mobile apps, websites, and government platforms could facilitate easy access.
- **Multilingual AI Tools**: Deploy artificial intelligence to automate translations and summaries, ensuring timely dissemination of legal information.

#### **c. Public Consultation**
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Before finalizing names, consult linguistic experts, civil society, and regional leaders to ensure that names reflect the pluralistic ethos of the nation.
- **Citizen Input**: Create avenues for citizens to suggest names or review drafts in their native languages.

#### **d. Education and Awareness**
- **Language Neutrality Training**: Train lawmakers and bureaucrats to appreciate and respect linguistic diversity in official matters.
- **Promotion of Regional Languages**: Encourage the use of regional languages in legislative discussions and publications.

### **4. Conclusion**
Balancing linguistic inclusivity with administrative efficiency is crucial for a diverse democracy like India. Naming laws in a manner that respects all linguistic communities would strengthen national unity and uphold Constitutional values. Through multilingual naming practices, technological innovation, and public consultation, the government can address the opposition's concerns while fostering a spirit of inclusion and equality.

> The controversy over naming new laws in Hindi and Sanskrit highlights concerns of linguistic inclusivity and potential "Hindi imposition." Critics argue it marginalizes non-Hindi speakers and violates the Constitution's emphasis on equality among languages. To resolve this, laws should be named bilingually in Hindi and English, with translations in regional languages for accessibility. Technology, such as AI translation tools, can help disseminate laws in all 22 scheduled languages. Public consultations, linguistic representation in drafting, and promoting regional languages in legislative contexts can ensure inclusivity. Balancing linguistic diversity with administrative efficiency will foster unity and uphold India’s pluralistic ethos.
