# Amid high inflation, RBI retains repo rate at 6.5%

Inflation refers to the sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over a period, leading to a decrease in the purchasing power of money. In simpler terms, as inflation rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services.

**Problems Arising from Inflation:**

1. **Reduced Purchasing Power**: As prices rise, consumers can afford less with the same amount of money, effectively reducing their standard of living.

2. **Income Redistribution**: Inflation can erode the real value of savings, disproportionately affecting those on fixed incomes or with cash savings.

3. **Uncertainty in Business Planning**: High inflation creates uncertainty, making it challenging for businesses to plan for the future, potentially deterring investment.

4. **Impact on Competitiveness**: If domestic inflation is higher than that of trading partners, exports may become more expensive, reducing international competitiveness.

**Government Measures to Reduce Inflation:**

1. **Fiscal Policy Adjustments**:
   - **Reducing Public Expenditure**: Cutting down on government spending can decrease overall demand in the economy, helping to control inflation.
   - **Increasing Taxes**: Higher taxes can reduce disposable income, leading to lower consumer spending and demand-pull inflation.

2. **Supply-Side Interventions**:
   - **Enhancing Production**: Investing in infrastructure and technology to boost the supply of goods and services can help meet demand and stabilize prices.
   - **Import Policies**: Reducing import duties on essential goods can lower their domestic prices, easing inflationary pressures.

3. **Price Controls and Subsidies**:
   - **Regulating Prices**: Implementing price ceilings on essential commodities can directly control inflation, though it may lead to shortages.
   - **Providing Subsidies**: Offering subsidies on basic goods can make them more affordable, indirectly controlling inflation.

**Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Measures to Control Inflation:**

1. **Monetary Policy Tools**:
   - **Repo Rate Adjustments**: The RBI can increase the repo rate, making borrowing more expensive, which reduces money supply and demand, thereby controlling inflation.
   - **Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)**: Raising the CRR requires banks to hold a higher proportion of their deposits as reserves, reducing the funds available for lending and thus controlling money supply.

2. **Open Market Operations (OMO)**:
   - **Selling Government Securities**: By selling securities, the RBI absorbs excess liquidity from the market, reducing inflationary pressures.

3. **Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF)**:
   - **Managing Short-Term Liquidity**: Through LAF, the RBI can adjust the amount of money available in the banking system, influencing inflation.

4. **Communication and Forward Guidance**:
   - **Setting Inflation Expectations**: By clearly communicating its inflation targets and policy intentions, the RBI can influence public expectations and economic behavior, aiding in inflation control.
pproach to understanding and controlling inflation.

> Inflation is the sustained rise in the general price level, reducing purchasing power. High inflation in India causes problems like reduced consumer spending, income erosion, business uncertainty, and reduced export competitiveness. The government combats inflation through fiscal measures such as reducing expenditure, increasing taxes, improving supply, and offering subsidies. The RBI uses monetary tools like raising the repo rate, adjusting the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR), and conducting Open Market Operations (OMO) to control liquidity and curb inflation. These combined efforts aim to balance economic growth and price stability, ensuring affordability while addressing demand-supply mismatches in essential commodities.

# Building on the revival of the manufacturing sector

India’s journey to becoming a global manufacturing hub has gained momentum with the government’s strategic policy initiatives, particularly the **Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme**. This scheme has been instrumental in transforming the manufacturing landscape in sectors such as mobile manufacturing, electronics, pharmaceuticals, automobile, and textiles, among others, through enhanced production, exports and job creation.

The scheme’s impressive performance has been mirrored by the results of the **Annual Survey of Industries (ASI)**` for 2022-23, released recently, which reveals a positive correlation between PLI scheme incentives and sectoral performance. In the ASI data, manufacturing output registered a robust growth rate of 21.5%, while gross value added (GVA) grew by 7.3%. This expansion comes on the back of the PLI scheme’s success, showcasing that many sectors benefiting from the scheme have performed particularly well. Basic metal manufacturing, coke and refined petroleum products, food products, chemicals and chemical products, and motor vehicles — many of which are covered under the PLI scheme — collectively contributed 58% to the total manufacturing output and registered an output growth of 24.5% in 2022-23.

### Recovery of the manufacturing sector

ASI surveys are a vital source of data on the registered, organised manufacturing sector in the economy. They include factories with 10 or more workers using power, and those with 20 or more workers, without power. The results of the ASI 2022-23 show a healthy double-digit expansion in the growth rate of manufacturing sector output — at 21.5% — despite a high base of 2021-22 which saw a sharp rebound as the economy emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic-induced slump. The impressive growth in output and value added in 2022-23, as compared to the pre-pandemic period, indicates that the manufacturing sector is slowly but steadily turning the corner after the disruptions in recent years.

The performance of the manufacturing sector shows that the stage is set for India to become a global manufacturing powerhouse. However, strong reforms are needed to fully capitalise on the manufacturing potential.

The success of the PLI scheme underscores the need to expand its scope beyond the traditional industries where manufacturing activity is concentrated. Extending PLI incentives to labour-intensive sectors such as apparel, leather, footwear and furniture, as well as sunrise industries such as aerospace, space technology and MRO could unlock new growth frontiers. There are also sectors with high import dependency but untapped domestic capabilities such as capital goods. This can help in reducing vulnerability to global demand fluctuations and supply chain disruptions. Promoting green manufacturing and incentivising research and development in advanced manufacturing technologies can further enhance India’s manufacturing competitiveness.

The striking gap between manufacturing output growth (21.5%) and GVA growth (7.3%) — as the ASI data show — is largely driven by soaring input prices, which surged by 24.4% in 2022-23. This divergence suggests that while production volumes are rising, industries are grappling with elevated input prices, which have eroded their value addition. With bulk of the inputs being imported, it is pivotal to bring down their landing costs in the country. To bring this to fruition, a more streamlined import regime that simplifies tariffs into a three-tier system, with 0 – 2.5% for raw materials, 2.5% – 5% for intermediates, and 5% – 7.5% for finished goods, could help mitigate these input costs, enhance competitiveness, and improve India’s integration into global value chains.

### A concentration of industrial activity

The regional imbalance in manufacturing activity, with Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh, collectively accounting for over 54% of total manufacturing GVA and 55% of employment, highlights the concentration of industrial activity in a few States. This regional imbalance not only hinders equitable development across the country but also limits the sector’s overall growth potential. For India to fully capitalise on its manufacturing capacity, it is essential for States to be an active participant in India’s growth story by implementing the fundamental factor market reforms in areas such as land, labour and power in addition to developing infrastructure, and promoting investments.

### Focus must move to MSMEs and women

For manufacturing to serve as a true catalyst for inclusive growth, special attention must be given to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) and increasing women’s participation in the workforce. MSMEs contribute around 45% of India’s manufacturing GDP and employ about 60 million people. Tailoring PLI incentives to accommodate MSMEs, by lowering capital investment thresholds and reducing production targets, would empower these enterprises to scale up, innovate and integrate more effectively into value chains.

Enhancing female workforce participation is an untapped opportunity for boosting manufacturing growth. The World Bank’s latest South Asia Development Update estimates that India’s manufacturing output could rise by 9% if more women join the workforce. Developing supportive infrastructure such as hostels, dormitories, and childcare facilities near factories could significantly boost women’s participation in manufacturing, driving output and inclusive development.

To transform the Indian economy into a developed economy by 2047, the manufacturing sector ought to play a critical role. As in the CII’s own estimations, its share in the GVA has a potential to rise from the current 17% to over 25% by 2030-31, and to 27% by 2047-48 if sustained efforts to boost domestic manufacturing capabilities and domestic value addition continue. Apart from boosting its competitiveness by improving ease of doing business and bringing down cost of doing business, seizing the current moment by leveraging on the slew of policy measures will be imperative for the manufacturing sector.

> Reviving the manufacturing sector is crucial for boosting India's economic growth, employment, and exports. Key strategies include enhancing infrastructure, fostering innovation, and streamlining regulations to attract domestic and foreign investments. Policies like **Make in India** and **PLI (Production-Linked Incentive) Schemes** aim to promote sectors such as electronics, automobiles, and renewable energy. Adopting advanced technologies like automation, AI, and Industry 4.0 can improve productivity and global competitiveness. Strengthening MSMEs through financial support and skilling programs is vital. Additionally, addressing energy needs sustainably and building robust supply chains can ensure a resilient, inclusive, and sustainable manufacturing ecosystem for long-term growth.

# Silica scars

### Silicosis and Mining in India: A Critical Challenge

India's aspiration for economic growth has intensified mining activities, particularly for minerals like **silicon dioxide (silica)**, a key component of sand and stone used in construction. However, prolonged exposure to silica dust poses severe health risks to mine workers, leading to **silicosis**, a chronic and irreversible lung disease. Silicosis affects workers regardless of age, with its onset determined by the level and duration of exposure. This disease is particularly concerning as it threatens millions of workers, many of them young.

#### The Magnitude of the Problem

The **Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)** reported in 1999 that over **eight million people** were highly exposed to silica dust. This number has likely increased due to the expansion of mining activities following government policies to open new mines. Silica particles, when inhaled, embed themselves in lung tissues, impairing respiratory function and leading to chronic health issues. The **National Green Tribunal (NGT)** recently directed the **Central Pollution Control Board** (CPCB) to draft new guidelines for granting permissions for silica mining and associated operations. It also asked the Uttar Pradesh government and Pollution Control Board to establish healthcare facilities in mining regions. However, these measures have not yet translated into meaningful action for affected workers.

#### Challenges in Implementing Safeguards

India’s **Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code 2020** mandates employers to notify authorities about workplace health threats and report diseases like silicosis. It also requires free annual health check-ups for workers. Despite these provisions, compliance remains poor:
1. **Underreporting of Cases**: Employers often fail to notify the **Directorate General of Mines Safety (DGMS)** about silicosis cases, limiting the state’s ability to monitor and enforce workplace safety standards.
2. **Misdiagnosis**: Health-care providers frequently misrecord silicosis as **tuberculosis (TB)**, which undermines accurate data collection and effective treatment.
3. **Lack of Medical Infrastructure**: Resource frontier states, where mining is concentrated, suffer from inadequate healthcare facilities and low literacy levels, making it difficult for workers to seek timely help.

The state's **passivity** in addressing workplace safety exacerbates the issue. Many workers are part of a disorganised labour force, with mining often being their primary livelihood. They tolerate poor working conditions and avoid seeking medical or legal recourse until their condition becomes life-threatening.

#### Need for Immediate Action

While the NGT’s directives are well-intentioned, the situation calls for **urgent and comprehensive interventions**:
1. **Strengthening Enforcement**:
   - Ensure strict compliance with workplace safety laws.
   - Penalize mine operators who fail to report silicosis cases or provide adequate safety measures.
2. **Health Infrastructure**:
   - Establish specialized hospitals in mining regions with the capacity to diagnose and treat silicosis.
   - Train healthcare providers to accurately identify silicosis and differentiate it from TB.
3. **Awareness and Advocacy**:
   - Launch awareness campaigns to educate workers about silicosis risks, prevention, and their rights.
   - Encourage workers to report unsafe conditions and seek timely medical assistance.
4. **Technological Innovations**:
   - Promote dust suppression technologies in mining operations.
   - Equip workers with adequate personal protective equipment (PPE).
5. **Policy Reform**:
   - Introduce schemes for compensation and rehabilitation of silicosis patients.
   - Create a central database to track and monitor silicosis cases and mining practices.

#### Conclusion

Silicosis is not only a health crisis but also a matter of **climate and social justice**. India’s resource frontier states must balance mining activities with worker safety and environmental sustainability. For this, proactive governance, robust policy enforcement, and collaboration between stakeholders are essential. Addressing silicosis effectively will not only improve workers’ welfare but also reflect India's commitment to equitable development and justice in its industrial growth narrative.

> India’s growing mining activities, especially for silica, have led to increased cases of **silicosis**, a chronic lung disease caused by inhaling silica dust. Despite legal safeguards under the **Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code 2020**, poor enforcement, underreporting, and misdiagnosis as tuberculosis hinder worker safety. The **National Green Tribunal (NGT)** has urged stricter guidelines and improved healthcare facilities, but the state’s passivity remains a significant obstacle. Solutions include enforcing workplace safety laws, establishing specialized hospitals, raising awareness, and introducing dust suppression technologies. Addressing silicosis requires urgent, coordinated efforts to protect workers and ensure equitable, sustainable industrial growth.

# No plans for de-dollarisation: Das

### What is De-dollarisation?

**De-dollarisation** refers to the process of reducing a country's reliance on the U.S. dollar for international trade, financial transactions, and as a reserve currency. It involves diversifying foreign reserves into other currencies, using local currencies or alternatives (like gold or cryptocurrencies) for trade settlements, and reducing dependency on dollar-denominated assets.

Countries pursue de-dollarisation to enhance their financial sovereignty, reduce exposure to risks associated with U.S. monetary policies, and protect against dollar volatility or sanctions.

---

### How De-dollarisation Can Help India

1. **Reduce Exchange Rate Volatility**:
   - Lower reliance on the dollar can shield India from currency fluctuations caused by U.S. monetary policies, such as interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.

2. **Strengthen Rupee’s Role**:
   - Increased use of the Indian rupee (INR) in trade can boost its global acceptance, stabilizing its value and reducing India’s trade deficit.

3. **Reduce Trade Deficit**:
   - By settling trade in local currencies, India can save on dollar payments, especially for imports like oil, lowering the burden on forex reserves.

4. **Mitigate Dollar-Denominated Debt Risks**:
   - A reduced dependency on the dollar can protect India from repayment challenges due to a strengthening dollar and rising global interest rates.

5. **Enhance Economic Resilience**:
   - De-dollarisation can insulate India from global shocks linked to the dollar, such as inflationary pressures caused by a strong dollar.

6. **Diversify Foreign Exchange Reserves**:
   - Holding reserves in multiple currencies or gold reduces the risk of value erosion linked to dollar depreciation.

7. **Geopolitical Independence**:
   - De-dollarisation minimizes India's vulnerability to U.S. sanctions and financial restrictions, enhancing strategic autonomy.

---

### Challenges of De-dollarisation for India

- **Global Trade Norms**: Most global trade, including oil, is dollar-dominated, making de-dollarisation challenging without wide global adoption.
- **Market Liquidity**: The dollar is the most liquid and widely used currency, providing stability in international trade and finance.
- **Transition Costs**: Shifting to alternative currencies or systems requires investments in infrastructure, agreements, and trust-building with trading partners.

---

### India's Steps Towards De-dollarisation

- **Bilateral Trade Agreements**: India has signed agreements with countries like Russia and Sri Lanka to settle trade in local currencies.
- **Promotion of Rupee Trade**: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has initiated policies encouraging trade settlements in Indian rupees.
- **Diversified Forex Reserves**: India has increased its gold reserves and diversified into other currencies like the euro and yen.

---

### Conclusion

De-dollarisation can help India strengthen its financial stability, reduce trade vulnerabilities, and enhance economic resilience. However, the process requires careful planning, global cooperation, and a phased approach to mitigate risks and ensure successful implementation in the long term.

> De-dollarisation involves reducing reliance on the U.S. dollar for trade, financial transactions, and reserves, enhancing financial sovereignty and mitigating risks from dollar volatility. For India, it can lower exchange rate volatility, reduce the trade deficit, strengthen the rupee’s global role, and diversify forex reserves. It also enhances economic resilience and geopolitical independence by reducing exposure to U.S. monetary policies and sanctions. However, challenges include global trade norms favoring the dollar, market liquidity issues, and high transition costs. India is promoting rupee trade through bilateral agreements and diversifying reserves, taking measured steps towards de-dollarisation to balance benefits and challenges.
