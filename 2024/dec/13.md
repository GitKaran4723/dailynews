He transformed the CAG from a passive auditor to an active participant in India’s governance, exposing corruption, ensuring fiscal accountability, and enhancing public trust in democratic institutions. His work remains a benchmark for future CAGs, symbolizing integrity, courage, and a relentless commitment to the nation’s welfare.

> The CAG report on Karnataka’s public health infrastructure (2016–2022) highlights major gaps in implementing the **Karnataka Integrated Public Health Policy (KIPHP)**. Deviations from national norms, especially the **Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS)**, inadequate staffing, and high vacancy rates (29%-53%) for doctors, nurses, and paramedics were noted. **Tertiary care facilities** and **AYUSH hospitals** faced severe shortages, with 59% vacancies in AYUSH hospitals. Maternity services suffered from staffing and drug shortages, affecting care quality, with stillbirth rates ranging from 0% to 44.19%. The report recommends adopting IPHS norms, workforce planning, and strengthening maternal care to improve healthcare accessibility and quality.

# The missing spotlight on urban local government polls

Urban local governments (ULGs) function as units of decentralised local self-governance, and are responsible for delivering civic services at the first mile, ensuring quality of life for citizens. The **74th Constitutional Amendment Act (CAA) was introduced in 1992** to codify this role of ULGs. Over 30 years later, the objectives of this landmark amendment are yet to be realised. The ongoing discourse on simultaneous elections, popularly known as One Nation One Election (ONOE), is a unique opportunity to spotlight a basic requirement of local democracy, i.e., elections to ULGs — a consideration that has generally been absent in deliberations on the ONOE.

### ‘State subjects’ as reasoning

The 79th report of the Parliament Standing Committee on Law and Justice on the ‘Feasibility of Simultaneous Elections,’ submitted in 2015, while advocating simultaneous elections to the Lok Sabha and State Assemblies, was silent on elections to ULGs. A discussion paper (2017) by the NITI Aayog, on ‘Analysis of Simultaneous Elections’, kept ULGs out of its purview, arguing that the third-tier institutions are State subjects and that the sheer number of such institutions across the country makes it “impractical, and possibly impossible, to synchronise elections”. Similar reasoning is put forward in the 2018 draft report of the Law Commission of India on simultaneous elections. But in a refreshing departure, the High Level Committee (HLC) constituted by the Government of India to provide a road map for implementation of simultaneous elections, deliberated on local body elections and recommended synchronising them within 100 days of simultaneous elections to the Lok Sabha and State Assemblies.

India has over 4,800 ULGs that oversee nearly 40% of the population, a figure which is estimated to cross 50% by 2050. Cities are the backbone of the country’s economy, contributing over 60% to India’s GDP. Well-governed cities accelerate economic growth, and promote social and cultural well being. Thus, ensuring regular elections to install democratically-elected governments in our cities every five years ought to be a matter of mainstream political discourse and policy formulation. The HLC report, which was accepted by the Union government in September 2024, touched upon the procedure of elections to local governments and is a good start in this direction. However, deeper analysis is necessary to understand and address the current state of affairs of elections to ULGs.

### Uncertainty and delays in elections

It may come as a surprise to many that despite the constitutional mandate of holding elections to municipalities every five years, elections are routinely delayed across thousands of ULGs — sometimes by several years. According to the Compendium of Performance Audits on the Implementation of the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act, 1992 (published by the Comptroller and Auditor General, or CAG of India in November 2024), elections were delayed in over 60% of ULGs across India. Such ULGs are directly governed by State governments, violating the principle of decentralisation as envisaged in the Constitution. This also adversely impacts accountability as citizens lack representation and have limited avenues for airing their grievances and development needs. Elections that are held on time are the sine qua non for democracy — not just for Parliament and the State legislatures but also for every municipality in the country.

Holding elections to ULGs is not enough. After the results are announced, the elected councils have to be operationalised with State governments calling for their first meeting to enable elections to the offices of mayors/chairpersons and standing committees. A study undertaken by Janaagraha found that there was a delay by 11 months on average in the formation of councils after the declaration of election results of the municipal corporations in Karnataka. In effect, ULGs continue to function under the administrative control of State governments. This defeats the electoral mandate given by the people, making elected city councillors powerless to attend to the development needs of their electorate.

### Disempowered State Election Commissions

Another important issue is the disempowerment of the State Election Commissions (SECs), which are constitutional bodies responsible for supervising and conducting ULG elections. The CAG report notes that only four out of the 15 States assessed have empowered their SECs to carry out ward delimitation. The report further notes that elections to ULGs were delayed due to a delay in ward delimitation by State governments or because of court cases regarding reservations. Given the high political ramifications of ward delimitation and reservation exercises, it is necessary that these functions are carried out by independent authorities such as the SECs.

A holistic analysis of the challenges in conducting elections to ULGs promptly is important in the ongoing national discourse on the synchronisation of elections. There is an urgent need to build on the beginning made by the HLC to effect the reforms necessary in ULG elections.

The Government of India has proposed setting up an implementation group to prepare a plan of action that would execute the HLC’s recommendations. The government has also expressed its intent to have consultations across the country on this topic. It is hoped and expected that the agenda for reforms to ensure regular and scheduled elections to ULGs will feature in these dialogues and that the Union and State governments will come together to make local democracy in our cities operational and vibrant.

> Urban local government polls, critical for grassroots democracy, often lack adequate attention despite their importance in addressing urban governance challenges. These elections empower municipal bodies to manage essential services like sanitation, water supply, and urban planning. However, low voter turnout, limited public awareness, and inadequate focus on the role of elected representatives undermine their effectiveness. Strengthening urban local governance requires greater public engagement, transparent electoral processes, and capacity-building for municipal leaders. As cities grow, effective local governments are essential for sustainable urban development and ensuring citizen-centric governance, making it imperative to spotlight their significance in the democratic framework.

# Should the executive have the power to pardon?

### **Analysis of Clemency Powers: Key Questions Answered**

#### **1. Should the executive power of clemency rest with the legislature to avert misuse?**
- **Sanjay Hegde (SH):** Vesting clemency powers in the legislature could lead to corruption and majority rule. Historically, clemency is rooted in sovereignty, allowing a single authority to exercise discretion in exceptional cases.
- **Alok Prasanna Kumar (APK):** Clemency inherently involves political judgment and cannot be purely legal. Alexander Hamilton argued for placing this power with a single constitutional officeholder to temper justice with mercy, beyond the rigidities of law.

**Conclusion:** The executive is better suited for clemency powers to ensure swift and subjective decisions, though safeguards are necessary.

---

#### **2. Should an independent clemency commission replace the existing system?**
- **APK:** While a commission could provide valuable input, its advice would not be binding on the President. Transparency and public scrutiny through modern media are sufficient checks.
- **SH:** Clemency decisions will always attract public criticism. Historical examples, like Gerald Ford’s pardon of Nixon, show that clemency often reflects broader political or societal considerations rather than legal consensus.

**Conclusion:** A commission could support informed decisions, but the ultimate discretion should remain with the executive.

---

#### **3. Would expanding judicial review over clemency decisions prevent misuse?**
- **SH:** In the U.S., judicial review over clemency is unlikely. However, in India, courts have intervened in cases of mala fide actions, as seen in *Epuru Sudhakar v. State of Andhra Pradesh* (2006).
- **APK:** Clemency is inherently subjective, and courts cannot standardize mercy. While procedural violations may be checked, clemency must retain flexibility to address unique circumstances.

**Conclusion:** Judicial review should be limited to procedural fairness, ensuring clemency remains a tool for justice beyond legal rigidity.

---

#### **4. Should U.S. Congress play a greater role in clemency processes?**
- **SH:** Congressional mandates can guide clemency processes but cannot strictly bind them. Clemency is unique, addressing humanity and justice in extraordinary cases.
- **APK:** Laws cannot entirely prevent misuse of authority. Even seemingly controversial clemency decisions may be vindicated over time.

**Conclusion:** Congress can provide oversight mechanisms but cannot replace executive discretion.

---

#### **5. What reforms are necessary in India’s clemency process?**
- **SH:** Guidelines for clemency should balance executive discretion and public trust. Examples like A.G. Perarivalan’s release show the need for clarity in gubernatorial decisions and the prioritization of closure in prolonged cases.
- **APK:** Reformative justice should be central. Processes like parole, remission, and early release must be streamlined to ensure mercy extends beyond death penalty cases, focusing on rehabilitation and reintegration.

**Conclusion:** Reforms in India should prioritize transparency, reformative justice, and quicker decision-making to ensure clemency is applied equitably and effectively.

> United States President Joe Biden’s recent decision to pardon his son Hunter Biden for any federal crimes he committed or may have committed between January 1, 2014, and December 1, 2024 has brought renewed focus on the expansive clemency powers granted to the President by the U.S. Constitution. The President’s volte-face has provoked strong condemnation from both Republicans and Democrats.

# Jharkhand HC stays law on 75% reservation for locals in private jobs

### **Jharkhand HC Stays Law on 75% Reservation for Locals in Private Jobs: Constitutionality and Ethicality**

The Jharkhand High Court’s stay on the law mandating **75% reservation for locals in private sector jobs** reignites debates on the constitutionality and ethicality of such policies. While the law aims to address unemployment among locals, it raises concerns regarding its alignment with constitutional principles, federalism, and its long-term implications for the private sector.

---

### **Constitutional Considerations**

#### **1. Right to Equality (Article 14):**
- The Constitution guarantees **equality before the law** and prohibits discrimination on grounds such as place of birth or residence.
- A blanket 75% reservation for locals in private jobs may be seen as violating the principle of equality by favoring one group over others without sufficient justification.

#### **2. Freedom of Movement and Employment (Article 19(1)(e) and (g)):**
- Article 19(1)(e): Grants citizens the right to reside and settle in any part of India.
- Article 19(1)(g): Provides the right to practice any profession or carry on any occupation, trade, or business.
- A law mandating reservations for locals could discourage non-locals from seeking employment in the state, infringing upon these fundamental rights.

#### **3. Directive Principles of State Policy (Article 39):**
- Article 39 directs the State to ensure that citizens have adequate means of livelihood.
- While the Directive Principles support the intent to address unemployment, they cannot override fundamental rights.

#### **4. Federal Structure:**
- Employment policies involving private enterprises must consider the **Concurrent List** in the Seventh Schedule, where labor laws are shared between the Centre and the States.
- States can legislate on employment, but the policies must align with overarching constitutional principles, including national unity and integrity.

---

### **Ethical Considerations**

#### **1. Addressing Unemployment:**
- Jharkhand’s law seeks to address unemployment among locals, a legitimate concern in a state with high joblessness rates.
- Ethically, governments have a responsibility to prioritize the welfare of their residents, especially marginalized groups who face barriers to employment.

#### **2. Inclusivity vs. Exclusivity:**
- While promoting local employment is ethical, policies that exclude non-locals or impose heavy restrictions on private enterprises could lead to divisiveness and social fragmentation.
- Reservation policies should aim for inclusivity by empowering locals through skill development rather than restricting opportunities for others.

#### **3. Impact on Private Sector:**
- Forcing private companies to comply with reservation policies may deter investment and innovation, particularly if the local workforce lacks the requisite skills.
- Ethically, the government must balance its duty to address unemployment with the need to foster a thriving economic environment.

#### **4. Regional Imbalances:**
- States with high levels of industrialization or better employment opportunities might attract migrants. Reservation policies for locals could exacerbate regional disparities and create barriers to national integration.

---

### **Balancing Federalism and Local Needs**

1. **State Autonomy:**
   - Federalism allows states like Jharkhand to address local unemployment through tailored policies.
   - However, such laws must respect the constitutional framework and ensure they do not conflict with the larger goal of national unity.

2. **Inter-State Coordination:**
   - Employment is a national concern. Instead of unilateral state policies, collaborative frameworks between states and the Centre could address unemployment comprehensively.

---

### **Conclusion**

The Jharkhand law on 75% reservation for locals in private jobs raises significant constitutional and ethical concerns. While it reflects the state’s intent to address local unemployment, it must adhere to principles of equality, freedom of employment, and the federal structure. Ethically, the focus should shift to skill development, infrastructure improvement, and creating employment opportunities that benefit locals without undermining the rights of others or deterring private investment. Achieving this balance is essential for fostering equitable and sustainable development in the state and across India.

> The Jharkhand High Court’s stay on the law mandating 75% reservation for locals in private jobs highlights constitutional and ethical concerns. While the law aims to address unemployment, it may violate **Articles 14 and 19** by undermining equality and restricting the freedom to work and settle across India. It also risks deterring private sector investments and creating social divisiveness. Ethically, prioritizing locals is valid but should focus on skill development and inclusivity rather than exclusivity. Balancing state autonomy with constitutional principles and fostering inter-state coordination is essential to address unemployment while ensuring national unity and economic growth.
