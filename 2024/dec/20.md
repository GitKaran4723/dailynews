# Eklavya schools struggle to meet 5% PVTG sub-quota; dropouts on the rise 

### Ekalavya Schools and PVTG Sub-Quota

**Ekalavya Schools** are a government initiative in India aimed at providing quality education to children from marginalized tribal communities, especially in remote and underserved areas. These schools are named after **Ekalavya**, a character from the Mahabharata, symbolizing the aspiration of tribal communities to receive education and empower their future generations. The primary focus is to bridge the educational gap for students belonging to the **Primitive Tribal Groups (PVTG)** and Scheduled Tribes (ST), with special emphasis on their cultural and educational needs.

The **PVTG Sub-Quota** is a provision within these schools that ensures 5% of the total student intake is reserved for **PVTGs**. PVTGs are groups that are identified as particularly vulnerable due to factors like their limited population, lack of access to resources, and historical isolation. These groups are considered at a higher risk of social and educational deprivation. The policy aims to provide targeted education interventions to uplift these communities and prevent their further marginalization.

---

### Reasons for the Rise in Dropouts from Ekalavya Schools

1. **Lack of Resources**  
   - Despite the government’s efforts, **Ekalavya schools** often struggle with inadequate infrastructure, teaching materials, and access to basic resources like books and technology. This hampers the quality of education, causing frustration among students and parents.

2. **Teacher Shortage and High Turnover**  
   - **Teacher shortages** and **high turnover rates** make it difficult for schools to provide consistent education. Teachers, especially those posted in remote tribal areas, may not have the required support and training, leading to ineffective teaching.

3. **Economic Constraints**  
   - Many families in **tribal areas** live below the poverty line. While the schools provide free education, the **opportunity cost** of sending children to school is high for poor families. Children often drop out to assist with household chores or work for family income, especially during the harvesting season or in times of financial distress.

4. **Cultural and Social Barriers**  
   - **Cultural disconnect** between the school curriculum and the tribal communities’ way of life leads to students feeling alienated or disconnected from formal education. Additionally, **language barriers** and **community norms** may discourage the students from pursuing education beyond a certain level.

5. **Inadequate Focus on PVTG Needs**  
   - Although the **5% PVTG sub-quota** exists, the specific needs of these communities, like **socio-cultural aspects** and **psychosocial challenges**, are often overlooked. Many PVTG children struggle with issues of **identity** and **social stigma**, which affect their retention in schools.

6. **Distance and Accessibility**  
   - **Remote geographical locations** of Ekalavya schools often make commuting difficult for children. Poor roads, lack of transport, and harsh climatic conditions deter children from attending school regularly. In many cases, children from distant villages drop out due to these challenges.

7. **Peer Pressure and Societal Expectations**  
   - In tribal communities, traditional roles like **farming**, **craftsmanship**, and **herding** are often more valued than formal education. Children face pressure from their peers and families to contribute to the household, especially when they are older. This cultural inclination towards early involvement in income-generating activities leads to high dropout rates.

8. **Health and Nutrition Issues**  
   - Poor health, malnutrition, and lack of medical facilities in remote areas contribute to frequent absenteeism, leading to **educational gaps** and eventually **dropouts**. The vulnerability of children to illness in these underserved areas further reduces their ability to stay engaged with education.

---

### Efforts to Address the Issues

1. **Government Initiatives**  
   - The government is working on improving the **infrastructure** and **teacher training** in Ekalavya schools. There have been efforts to increase the **stipend** or **financial incentives** for students to reduce the economic burden on families.

2. **Cultural Integration in Curriculum**  
   - A shift toward incorporating **tribal culture** and languages into the curriculum could help in making education more relevant and appealing to tribal students.

3. **Monitoring and Accountability**  
   - Increased **monitoring** of dropout rates and student progress is necessary, with a focus on identifying and addressing the root causes early. Collaboration with local communities can ensure better solutions tailored to their specific needs.

4. **Incentivizing Attendance**  
   - Programs that offer incentives for regular attendance, like **free meals**, **health check-ups**, and **community support**, can increase student retention.

---

### Conclusion

**Ekalavya schools** and the **PVTG sub-quota** are vital initiatives to promote education among tribal communities in India, but challenges such as **resource constraints**, **teacher shortages**, **cultural barriers**, and **economic hardship** continue to hinder the success of these programs. Addressing these issues through targeted interventions, stronger community involvement, and better policy implementation can help reduce dropout rates and ensure these schools fulfill their educational mission for the most vulnerable groups in society.

> Ekalavya Schools are a government initiative aimed at providing quality education to tribal children, particularly from Primitive Tribal Groups (PVTGs), in remote areas. These schools face challenges such as inadequate resources, teacher shortages, and high dropout rates. The 5% PVTG sub-quota is intended to ensure representation for these vulnerable groups, but issues like economic constraints, cultural disconnect, and societal pressures contribute to students dropping out. Additionally, logistical difficulties like distance and poor health further hinder retention. Efforts are needed to address these challenges through better infrastructure, community support, and curriculum adaptation to improve school attendance and reduce dropouts.

# The political crisis in South Korea

### The Political Crisis in South Korea

South Korea, a vibrant democracy and one of Asia's leading economies, has periodically faced political crises that have impacted its governance, stability, and international relations. The political crisis in South Korea has often been marked by corruption scandals, power struggles, and tensions between the executive, legislature, and judiciary. The most recent political crisis, however, centers around issues such as corruption, executive authority, public dissatisfaction, and societal divisions, and it threatens to disrupt the political and economic order in the country.

#### Historical Context of Political Crises in South Korea

South Korea's political history has been tumultuous, marked by military dictatorships, authoritarian regimes, and political unrest. Since the country's transition to democracy in the late 1980s, it has maintained a relatively stable democratic system. However, challenges like corruption scandals, political polarization, and concerns over the power concentration in the presidency have led to political instability.

The most significant example of political crisis occurred in 2016-2017, when then-President Park Geun-hye was impeached following a major corruption scandal. Park's involvement in the scandal, where she was accused of colluding with her confidante Choi Soon-sil to extort bribes from businesses and exert influence over government affairs, triggered mass protests and led to her eventual removal from office. This marked the first time in South Korea’s history that a sitting president was impeached. The scandal deeply eroded public trust in the government and created divisions within the political elite.

#### Recent Political Crises: The Struggles of President Yoon Suk-yeol

In recent years, President **Yoon Suk-yeol**, who took office in May 2022, has faced his own political struggles, adding to the ongoing political crises in South Korea. Yoon, a former prosecutor general, rose to power on the back of promises to root out corruption and fight for national reform. However, his administration has faced a series of challenges, including public dissatisfaction over its handling of the economy, inter-party conflict, and growing concerns about corruption.

One of the major issues at the heart of the current political crisis is **Yoon's confrontations with opposition parties**. His administration has struggled to work with the **National Assembly**, where the opposition holds significant power. The gridlock between the president and the legislature has made it difficult to pass key policies and economic reforms, particularly those related to the housing crisis, unemployment, and economic inequality. The inability to push through major reforms has led to growing dissatisfaction among the South Korean public, which has voiced its concerns over the lack of tangible results.

In addition to internal political conflicts, **Yoon’s handling of foreign policy** has also caused friction. His administration has faced challenges navigating **South Korea’s relationship with North Korea** amid rising tensions on the Korean Peninsula. Relations with **Japan** have also been strained over historical issues, and South Korea’s stance on the U.S.-China rivalry has created challenges in balancing its alliances with these major powers.

#### Corruption Scandals and Political Division

Corruption remains a persistent issue in South Korea’s political landscape. The Yoon administration has promised to take strong action against corrupt politicians and business leaders. However, accusations of corruption have surfaced within his own ranks. For instance, several members of his party, the **People Power Party (PPP)**, have been embroiled in scandals involving alleged **bribery, embezzlement, and abuse of power**. These scandals have intensified public disillusionment and further polarized the political climate.

The political division between the ruling and opposition parties has been exacerbated by the **growing influence of civil society groups** and **student-led protests**, especially over issues of economic inequality and social justice. The political crisis has led to **mass protests**, and the tensions between different factions of society have resulted in a fragmented political discourse. The inability of political leaders to come together and work for the collective good has further exacerbated the crisis.

#### Conclusion

The political crisis in South Korea reflects a broader global trend of rising populism, political polarization, and dissatisfaction with the political elite. While the country remains a beacon of democracy and economic success in the region, its political system is far from perfect. The challenges faced by President Yoon Suk-yeol’s administration, including internal party divisions, corruption scandals, and strained foreign relations, have put South Korea’s democratic institutions to the test. To overcome these crises, it is essential for political leaders in South Korea to prioritize national unity, ensure accountability, and work towards long-term reforms that benefit all citizens. Only then can the country overcome its current challenges and continue to prosper in the 21st century.

> South Korea's political crisis is marked by internal conflicts, corruption scandals, and public dissatisfaction. Recent struggles under President Yoon Suk-yeol’s administration include tensions with opposition parties, legislative gridlock, and challenges in implementing reforms. Yoon's promise to tackle corruption has been overshadowed by scandals within his own party, further dividing the political landscape. Additionally, foreign policy issues, particularly regarding North Korea and Japan, have strained South Korea’s international relations. The crisis reflects broader global trends of political polarization and dissatisfaction with political elites, requiring leaders to prioritize unity, accountability, and long-term reforms to address these challenges.

# Both Houses adjourned sine die

### Parliament and Its Sessions

The **Parliament of India** is the supreme legislative body in the country, responsible for making laws, scrutinizing the government’s work, and representing the people. It consists of two houses: the **Lok Sabha (House of the People)** and the **Rajya Sabha (Council of States)**. The Parliament works through **sessions**, which are specific periods during which it conducts its business. These sessions are held annually and are divided into three main parts: the **Budget Session**, the **Monsoon Session**, and the **Winter Session**.

### Adjournment and Adjournment Sine Die

The terms **adjournment** and **adjournment sine die** refer to the suspension of parliamentary proceedings for a period, but with different implications:

1. **Adjournment**: This is the temporary suspension of the parliamentary session for a short period, typically for the day or until the next day. It can occur at any time during the session and is usually announced by the **Speaker of the Lok Sabha** or the **Chairman of the Rajya Sabha**. The adjournment can be done for various reasons, such as allowing members to take a break or to avoid continuing discussions that may not be productive. The house is scheduled to reconvene at a later time, and the proceedings pick up where they left off.

2. **Adjournment Sine Die**: This is the **indefinite suspension** of parliamentary proceedings, meaning there is no scheduled date for the next meeting. It marks the formal conclusion of the session. The term “sine die” is a Latin phrase that means "without a day"—implying that no future date is fixed for reconvening. When a session of Parliament adjourns sine die, the House is essentially closed until the next session is called. This typically happens at the end of each parliamentary session and also when the **budget** or **important bills** have been passed, or when significant discussions have been concluded.

### Suspension of Members

In some cases, members of Parliament can be **suspended** from participating in the session due to various reasons such as misconduct, disruptive behavior, or violating parliamentary rules. This is a disciplinary measure to maintain decorum in the House. Suspension can happen temporarily for the remainder of the session or for a specified period, and in some instances, it can also be extended.

- **Temporary Suspension**: A member may be suspended for causing disruption, refusing to obey the Speaker’s orders, or engaging in physical altercations. The suspension can last for a limited time or for the duration of the session.
  
- **Suspension for a Longer Period**: In more severe cases, the suspension can extend beyond a session if the Speaker or Chairman believes the member’s actions warrant longer-term removal from proceedings.

Suspensions are considered a last resort and are subject to parliamentary rules. If a member feels the suspension is unjust, they can appeal to the House, which may take a vote to decide whether to lift the suspension or maintain it.

### Conclusion

The **adjournment** and **adjournment sine die** are essential processes that allow Parliament to organize its work effectively. Adjournments provide brief pauses, while adjournment sine die marks the conclusion of a session. **Suspensions**, on the other hand, maintain order and discipline within the Parliament by addressing inappropriate behavior or disruptions. These processes ensure that the legislative functions continue smoothly and that members of Parliament adhere to the rules and procedures required for effective governance.

> The **Parliament of India** consists of two houses: the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha. **Adjournment** refers to temporarily suspending parliamentary proceedings, often until the next day or session, while **adjournment sine die** marks the formal end of a session without a fixed date for reconvening. **Suspension** of members can occur due to misconduct, such as disruption or violating rules, and can be temporary or extend beyond the session. These procedures ensure the smooth functioning of Parliament, maintaining order and discipline, and allowing for the effective execution of legislative duties.
