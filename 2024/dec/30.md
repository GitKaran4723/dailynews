# One Nation One Election and representative democracy

The Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-Ninth Amendment) Bill, 2024, that was tabled in the Lok Sabha, proposes simultaneous elections for the Lok Sabha and State/Union Territory Legislative Assemblies with the insertion of Article 82(A). This ambitious reform seeks to synchronise elections, fix the tenure of the Lok Sabha, and simultaneously align elections to the State Assemblies. If the Lok Sabha or a State Assembly is dissolved before its five-year term, mid-term elections will only cover the remainder of the original tenure.

The Bill also amends Articles 83, 172, and 327, with changes effective from an ‘appointed date’, post-2029 general elections, thereby initiating simultaneous elections in 2034. A second Bill, the Union Territories Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024, aligns the tenure of Union Territories’ legislative Assemblies with the Lok Sabha and State Assemblies.

While the proposal seeks administrative efficiency and reduced election fatigue, critical questions arise: has the ‘One Nation, One Election (ONOE)’ process been truly inclusive and representative? Are there limits to our understanding of the representative spirit of Indian democracy?

### Understanding representative democracy

Representative democracy is a system wherein citizens elect representatives to make decisions on their behalf. Rooted in the principles of free and fair elections, political accountability, and the protection of individual rights, it balances majority rule with the protection of minority interests. This form of governance becomes especially critical in diverse and populous countries such as India.

The theoretical underpinnings emphasise that elected representatives act as intermediaries, ensuring stable governance while accommodating competing interests. Citizens, being too numerous and diverse to participate directly in governance, delegate authority to their elected representatives. The system thrives on periodic elections, informed citizen participation, and institutional checks and balances.

Despite its theoretical merits, representative democracy faces growing challenges in practice. A 2024 Pew Research Center study across 24 nations, including Brazil, India, Nigeria, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States, revealed widespread disillusionment with the system. Citizens increasingly questioned its effectiveness, with some exploring alternatives such as direct democracy, expert rule, or even authoritarian regimes.

In 13 countries, significant segments supported strong leaders bypassing parliamentary checks, reflecting frustration with institutional inefficiencies. Alarmingly, military rule garnered between 15% to 17% support in nations such as Greece, Japan, the U.K., and the U.S. Such trends underscore growing distrust in representative systems, driven by perceived inefficiencies, corruption, and unfulfilled promises.

### Jayaprakash Narayan’s critique

In India, debates about representative democracy are not new. Jayaprakash Narayan, in his seminal work, A Plea for Reconstruction of Indian Polity (1959), offered a deep critique of parliamentary democracy. JP argued that the reliance on individual voting created an ‘atomized society’, where fragmented, partisan politics overshadowed the collective national interest.

JP highlighted the following defects — risks of minority governments: In a multi-party system like India, he warned that parliamentary democracy risks unstable and unrepresentative governments.

**First**, demagoguery and populism: JP highlighted how political parties manipulate public opinion through half-truths, empty promises, and divisive rhetoric.

**Second**, centralisation of power: Parliamentary democracy, according to JP, concentrates power in the state, weakening intermediary institutions between citizens and the national government.

**Third**, financial costs of elections: JP critiqued the exorbitant cost of elections, tethering democracy to moneyed interests and large organisations.

While critical, JP’s analysis aimed to reform and strengthen democracy. His concerns resonate today as India debates ONOE and its implications for democratic representation.

For a reform as significant as ONOE, an inclusive and representative process is crucial. In representative democracies, public opinion shapes policy, holding governments accountable to citizens’ aspirations and concerns. To achieve this, pre-legislative consultation becomes indispensable, enabling policymakers to gather diverse views, address challenges, and enhance transparency.

The Pre-Legislative Consultation Policy, 2014, mandates a minimum 30-day period for public feedback on proposed legislation. It requires draft Bills to be accompanied by explanatory notes that clarify key provisions in accessible terms. However, the process adopted for ONOE fell short. First, inadequate consultation period: The high-level committee issued a public notice on January 5, 2024, inviting suggestions on ONOE. Citizens were given just 10 days — until January 15 — to respond, undermining the spirit of the 2014 policy. Second, lack of explanatory material: Despite the high-level committee being established in September 2023, no explanatory notes or background papers were provided, limiting citizens’ understanding of the proposal’s scope and challenges. Third, framing of questions: The high-level committee’s approach, seeking ‘yes/no’ responses on supporting ONOE, appeared perfunctory, giving the impression the matter was already settled.

Such procedural lapses risk alienating citizens and stakeholders, undermining trust in the reform process. In a diverse democracy like India, meaningful public engagement is vital to ensure that policy reflects varied perspectives and fosters consensus.

### Implications for representative democracy

The ONOE Bill raises critical questions about the representative nature of Indian democracy. First, centralisation versus federalism: synchronising elections risks a further centralising of power, potentially undermining the federal spirit of the Constitution. State-specific issues may be overshadowed by national narratives. Second, inclusivity and participation: by curtailing consultation and rushing reforms, the government risks sidelining citizens’ voices, weakening democratic inclusivity. Third, electoral accountability: frequent elections, while resource-intensive, enhance accountability by enabling voters to evaluate governments regularly. Simultaneous elections could dilute this accountability.

India’s democratic fabric thrives on citizen participation, inclusivity, and accountability. Reforms such as ONOE, while aimed at efficiency, must not compromise these principles. A rushed process undermines trust and risks centralisation. Only by adhering to the principles above can our democracy remain truly representative in letter and spirit.

> The **One Nation, One Election** concept aims to synchronize elections for the Lok Sabha, State Assemblies, Panchayats, and Urban Local Bodies to streamline governance and reduce electoral costs. Advocates argue it promotes **representative democracy** by reducing voter fatigue and ensuring consistent policy implementation, as frequent elections disrupt governance. However, critics highlight challenges, such as logistical complexities, undermining federalism, and risks of marginalizing regional voices. Implementing this requires constitutional amendments and consensus among stakeholders. While it may improve efficiency and reduce costs, ensuring democratic representation and addressing the diversity of India’s federal structure are essential for its success.

# The challenge of holding judges accountable

### **Review Mechanism for Judges in India**

The process of reviewing the conduct of judges in India is governed by stringent constitutional and statutory provisions to ensure judicial independence while maintaining accountability. It primarily involves the **Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968**, which lays down the procedure for addressing allegations of **"proved misbehaviour" or "incapacity"** against judges of the **Supreme Court** or **High Courts**.

---

### **Key Provisions of the Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968**

1. **Grounds for Review:**
   - A judge can be removed only on the grounds of **"proved misbehaviour"** or **"incapacity"**, as provided under **Article 124(4)** of the Constitution for Supreme Court judges and **Article 217(1)(b)** for High Court judges.

2. **Initiation of the Process:**
   - The process begins with a motion for impeachment, which must be signed by:
     - **100 members** in the Lok Sabha or
     - **50 members** in the Rajya Sabha.

3. **Inquiry Committee:**
   - Once the motion is admitted, an **Inquiry Committee** is constituted to investigate the allegations.
   - The committee comprises:
     - A sitting judge of the Supreme Court.
     - A Chief Justice of a High Court.
     - A distinguished jurist.

4. **Role of the Committee:**
   - The committee functions like a **trial court** and investigates charges against the judge.
   - It has powers akin to a civil court, such as summoning witnesses, examining evidence, and providing the judge an opportunity to defend.

5. **Report and Its Consequences:**
   - If the committee finds the charges proved, the report is presented to the House where the motion originated.
   - Both Houses of Parliament must pass the motion with a **two-thirds majority of members present and voting** for the judge's removal.
   - The final decision rests with the **President of India**, who issues an order for removal.

---

### **Challenges in the Review Mechanism**

1. **Cumbersome Process:**
   - The multi-layered procedure makes it difficult to remove erring judges swiftly.
2. **Political Influence:**
   - The process being initiated in Parliament can lead to politicization.
3. **Underutilization:**
   - Very few cases reach the impeachment stage, and no judge has been successfully removed so far.
4. **Lack of Intermediate Measures:**
   - No mechanisms exist for addressing lesser offenses or disciplining judges without impeachment.

---

### **The Way Forward**

1. **Strengthening Oversight:**
   - Establishing an independent **Judicial Accountability Commission** to investigate complaints.
2. **Transparent Processes:**
   - Ensuring clarity and fairness in reviewing allegations against judges.
3. **Ethical Reforms:**
   - Promoting adherence to a judicial code of conduct to prevent misbehaviour.

---

### **Conclusion**

The review mechanism for judges in India is designed to balance **judicial accountability** with **independence**, ensuring fair trials for alleged misbehaviour or incapacity. However, reforms are needed to make the process more efficient, transparent, and responsive, safeguarding the judiciary's integrity and public trust.

> The review mechanism for judges in India, governed by the **Judges (Inquiry) Act, 1968**, addresses **"proved misbehaviour" or "incapacity"** through a rigorous process. It begins with an impeachment motion in Parliament, requiring signatures from **100 Lok Sabha members** or **50 Rajya Sabha members**, and is followed by an investigation by an Inquiry Committee comprising senior judges and a jurist. Both Houses must pass the motion with a **two-thirds majority** for the judge’s removal, finalized by the **President of India**. While safeguarding judicial independence, the process is lengthy and underutilized, necessitating reforms for efficiency, transparency, and accountability.
