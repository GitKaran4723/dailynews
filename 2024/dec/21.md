# A chance to strike gold during the Kuwait visit

The Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, is set to visit Kuwait on December 21-22. The visit will be the first by an Indian Prime Minister in 43 years, the last being the visit by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1981. Mr. Modi was scheduled to visit Kuwait in January 2022, but the visit was postponed due to concerns about COVID-19.

The visit holds great significance not only for the bilateral ties but also the region, which is going through a very difficult phase of conflict and transition. Mr. Modi has visited all the other countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) over the past 10 years, some more than once, and not having visited Kuwait was seen as a gap in India’s West Asia engagement. This visit aims to not only plug this gap but also give a boost to the rather stagnant ties between the two countries which, otherwise, have much potential for a strong engagement.

### A country with strategic significance

Why Is Kuwait important? Despite being one of the smallest countries in the region, it holds significant strategic importance. Located at the north-east end of the Persian Gulf, it shares borders with Iraq and Saudi Arabia and hosts important American military bases. It is the only monarchy in the region which has experimented successfully with democracy. On regional issues, it has generally maintained a neutral stance and has often been the interlocutor in resolving disputes.

Its wealth is owed primarily to its vast oil reserves, which are sixth-largest globally. It is also one of the founding members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).

It also has one of the largest basket sovereign wealth funds. These funds, managed by the Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA), have grown at an impressive rate and are currently estimated to be $924 billion (in March 2024), the fourth largest in the world after Norway, China and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

### Untapped potential, existing links

India and Kuwait have always enjoyed friendly ties, built on a strong foundation of history and cultural bonds. India was one of the first countries to establish diplomatic relations with Kuwait following its independence from the British Protectorate in 1961. In fact, the Indian rupee was a legal tender in Kuwait till 1961.

Trade and people-to-people ties have traditionally been the main anchors of the bilateral ties. India has consistently been among the top trading partners of Kuwait, with the total bilateral trade with Kuwait during FY 2023-24 being $ 10.47 billion. During FY2023-24, Kuwait was the sixth largest crude supplier catering to about 3.0 % of India’s total energy needs. The KIA has invested indirectly in India with estimated investments of more than US$10 billion.

During the COVID-19 pandemic too, India and Kuwait demonstrated a strong sense of brotherhood. India provided two lakh vaccine doses. During the second wave of COVID-19 in May 2021, Kuwait provided 282 oxygen cylinders, 60 oxygen concentrators, ventilators and many other medical supplies to India.

People-to-people ties form the other firm anchor. Out of a population of almost 4.9 million, around 1 million Indians not only form the largest expatriate group in Kuwait but are also among the most trusted. As a special gesture, a ‘Festival of India’ was organised in Kuwait in March 2023. A weekly Hindi radio programme, ‘Namaste Kuwait has been started by Kuwait National Radio since April 2024. And, 26 schools in Kuwait with over 60,000 students, follow the Central Board of Secondary Education curriculum of India.

When tragedy struck on June 12, in the form of a fire in a residential building in Kuwait killing over 40 Indians, Kuwait rendered help and repatriated their mortal remains quickly.

### Areas to elevate ties

Despite enjoying mutual trust and goodwill, India’s ties with Kuwait — like with many others in the Gulf region — have not been able to transcend to the next level. Mr. Modi’s visit, therefore, offers the perfect opportunity to set things moving. The signing of a comprehensive strategic partnership agreement with Kuwait could be the ideal start. An agreement on defence cooperation could be signed too. India has invited Kuwait to join the International Solar Alliance (ISA) and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, which Kuwait is likely to accept. An agreement between KIA and the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) in India could be mutually beneficial and give impetus to growth in India. Like the UAE, Kuwait could become an important partner for storing strategic oil reserves in India.

From India, helping Kuwait in building its infrastructure under Kuwait’s ‘Vision 2035’ could be a good initiative. Setting up institutes of higher education, such as the Indian Institute of Technology and the Indian Institute of Management, and modern hospitals in Kuwait could boost people-to-people ties. Kuwait’s request for additional seats for its airlines from India (in addition to 12,000 seats per week allotted), could be considered as a special exemption, despite Kuwait not fulfilling the required quota. Cooperation in space programmes including launching satellites for Kuwait would make good headlines too.

The scope for Kuwait-India ties is huge and the wish list endless. Hopefully, this visit will provide the perfect platform to kick-start a golden era in this very important bilateral relationship.

> The recent visit to Kuwait presents India with an opportunity to enhance bilateral ties, particularly in trade, energy, and labor relations. Kuwait, a key Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) nation, is vital for India's energy security and is home to a significant Indian diaspora. Strengthening partnerships in renewable energy, technology, and healthcare can deepen economic cooperation. Addressing labor issues and ensuring welfare for Indian workers in Kuwait are crucial agenda points. By fostering mutual investments and collaboration, this visit can pave the way for stronger strategic and economic relations, benefiting both nations and securing India's interests in the Gulf region.

# We find ourselves in a slow growth, high inflation scenario

### Slow Growth, High Inflation Scenario: 

This situation refers to an **economic condition** characterized by two primary challenges: **slow economic growth** and **high inflation**. It’s a difficult phase for any economy as these factors usually exert pressure on businesses, households, and the overall economy. Let’s break down both components:

1. **Slow Growth**: Economic growth is typically measured by the **Gross Domestic Product (GDP)**, which reflects the total value of goods and services produced in an economy. Slow growth means that the economy is expanding at a slower pace than expected, often resulting in fewer job opportunities, reduced income growth, and sluggish industrial production.
   
2. **High Inflation**: Inflation refers to the **rate at which prices of goods and services rise** over time. High inflation erodes the purchasing power of money, meaning people’s money buys less. This impacts the cost of living and can lead to decreased consumer spending and increased production costs for businesses.

### How Can We Overcome This Situation?

Addressing slow growth and high inflation requires a multi-faceted approach, as both problems are interconnected. Here are some potential solutions:

#### 1. **Monetary Policy Adjustments**
   - **Raising Interest Rates**: Central banks, like the **Reserve Bank of India (RBI)** or others globally, can raise interest rates to combat inflation. Higher rates discourage borrowing and reduce demand, which can help cool down inflation. However, if raised too much, this can further slow down economic growth.
   - **Quantitative Tightening**: Central banks can also reduce the amount of money circulating in the economy, which might help control inflation, although this can also suppress economic activity in the short term.

#### 2. **Fiscal Policy Support**
   - **Government Stimulus**: To boost growth, the government can implement fiscal policies like **increased government spending** on infrastructure projects, which not only stimulates demand but also creates jobs. These measures can increase economic activity in the long term.
   - **Tax Cuts or Direct Transfers**: Lowering taxes or providing direct subsidies to vulnerable sections of society can increase disposable income, helping to revive consumption and demand in the economy.

#### 3. **Supply-Side Reforms**
   - **Boosting Productivity**: Investing in sectors that can enhance productivity, such as technology, education, and automation, can lead to more efficient economic output, helping improve growth without fueling inflation.
   - **Reducing Supply Chain Bottlenecks**: Improving infrastructure, logistics, and reducing trade barriers can help lower costs and make goods more affordable, helping to fight inflation while promoting growth.

#### 4. **Addressing Structural Issues**
   - **Labor Market Reforms**: Improving labor market flexibility, investing in workforce skills, and making labor laws more conducive to hiring and productivity can help increase economic potential and reduce unemployment.
   - **Incentivizing Innovation**: Supporting startups, technological innovation, and research and development can create new high-growth sectors and reduce dependency on traditional industries.

#### 5. **Global Cooperation and External Factors**
   - **Trade Agreements**: Improving trade relations and opening up new markets can boost exports, which can lead to economic growth. Similarly, securing affordable imports (such as oil and raw materials) can help reduce inflationary pressures.
   - **Managing Global Inflationary Trends**: Global events like oil price shocks or supply chain disruptions can impact inflation. Collaborative efforts between countries to stabilize markets can help contain rising prices.

#### 6. **Enhancing Consumer Confidence**
   - **Improving Trust**: Economic recovery requires boosting consumer confidence. This can be achieved through effective governance, transparent policies, and improving job security. When consumers are confident, they are more likely to spend, driving economic growth.

### Conclusion

The combination of slow growth and high inflation creates a challenging economic environment. To tackle this, coordinated efforts in **monetary policy**, **fiscal policy**, and **structural reforms** are needed. Governments, central banks, and international bodies must work together to implement policies that balance stimulating growth while keeping inflation in check. Patience and adaptability are essential, as these issues often require time to resolve effectively.

> A slow growth, high inflation scenario refers to an economy with sluggish growth and rising prices, which can lead to reduced purchasing power and limited economic activity. To overcome this, monetary policies like raising interest rates can control inflation, while fiscal policies such as government spending or tax cuts can stimulate growth. Supply-side reforms like improving productivity and addressing supply chain issues can help reduce costs. Structural reforms in labor markets and innovation can boost long-term growth. Collaboration with global partners to stabilize markets and enhance consumer confidence is essential for recovery in such a scenario.

# MSP for copra hiked by ₹422 per quintal for 2025 season

### Minimum Support Price (MSP) and Crops in India  

The **Minimum Support Price (MSP)** is a policy mechanism introduced by the Government of India to safeguard the interests of farmers by ensuring a guaranteed price for their produce. Announced by the **Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP)**, the MSP aims to protect farmers from distress sales, especially during periods of low market prices.  

#### Purpose and Importance of MSP  

1. **Price Stabilization**: MSP acts as a safety net, stabilizing agricultural incomes by guaranteeing a minimum price, even when market prices fall.  
2. **Encouraging Production**: It incentivizes farmers to produce specific crops, ensuring adequate supply for the country’s food security.  
3. **Reduction in Distress**: MSP provides financial stability to farmers, reducing the risk of debt and distress.  
4. **Support to Vulnerable Farmers**: MSP particularly benefits small and marginal farmers, who are more vulnerable to price volatility.  

#### Copra MSP Hike  

For the **2025 season**, the government has increased the MSP for **copra (dried coconut kernel)** by ₹422 per quintal. The new rates are:  
- **Ball copra**: ₹11,335 per quintal.  
- **Milling copra**: ₹10,860 per quintal.  

This increase is aimed at providing fair remuneration to coconut farmers, improving their incomes, and encouraging the cultivation of this versatile crop used in edible oil and other products.  

#### MSP and Covered Crops  

The government declares MSP for 22 mandated crops and a fair and remunerative price (FRP) for sugarcane. The crops include:  

1. **Cereals**: Wheat, rice, maize, barley, sorghum (jowar), pearl millet (bajra), and ragi.  
2. **Pulses**: Gram, arhar (tur), moong, urad, and lentils (masoor).  
3. **Oilseeds**: Groundnut, mustard, soybean, sunflower, sesame, and safflower.  
4. **Cash Crops**: Cotton, sugarcane (FRP-based), and copra.  

#### Challenges and Way Forward  

While MSP benefits farmers, its effectiveness is limited as it primarily applies to government-procured crops. Many farmers rely on open markets, where prices may not reach MSP levels. Additionally, MSP is criticized for favoring certain crops like wheat and rice, leading to regional and crop imbalances.  

#### Conclusion  

The MSP system remains a vital tool to ensure the welfare of farmers and the stability of agriculture in India. Expanding its coverage, improving procurement mechanisms, and encouraging diversification into high-value crops can make the system more inclusive and effective in addressing farmers' needs.

> The Minimum Support Price (MSP) is a government policy to protect farmers from price volatility by ensuring a minimum price for 22 crops and a fair and remunerative price (FRP) for sugarcane. For the 2025 season, the MSP for copra has been increased by ₹422 per quintal, benefiting coconut farmers and promoting cultivation. MSP covers cereals, pulses, oilseeds, and cash crops like cotton and copra. While it provides price stability and income support, challenges such as limited procurement and crop imbalance persist. Expanding MSP coverage and improving implementation can enhance its effectiveness and ensure better benefits for farmers across India.

# Parliament needs to be more productive, not sidetracked by barbs

The first winter session of 18th Lok Sabha ended on December 20 as one of the least productive and most acrimonious in history. The conflict between the government and the Opposition degenerated into a scuffle on the penultimate day, followed by absurd allegations and police reports. The Opposition sent a notice for a motion of no confidence in Rajya Sabha Chairman and Vice-President of India Jagdeep Dhankhar, which was rejected by the Deputy Chairman. The acrimony peaked with the Opposition turning a reference by Home Minister Amit Shah to Dr. B.R. Ambedkar into a stick to beat the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) with. Mr. Shah’s misspoken remarks were taken out of context by the Opposition which feels that it is par for the course. After all, the BJP had made ridiculous allegations about the Congress party’s supposed link with anti-India forces abroad to stall Parliament proceedings for several days earlier. Productivity in the Rajya Sabha was 40%, as it met for 43 hours and 27 minutes of the schedule. The Lok Sabha functioned for 54.5% of its scheduled time. Both the Houses witnessed protests from the treasury and Opposition sides over issues such as the alleged interference of U.S. billionaire George Soros in Indian politics, and the U.S. government’s actions against the Adani Group.

The session was scheduled to take up 16 Bills in the legislative business and the first batch of supplementary grants under the financial business. Of the 16 Bills, only one Bill, the Bharatiya Vayuyan Vidheyak, 2024, significant for the civil aviation sector, was passed in both Houses. The Rajya Sabha passed the Boilers Bill and the Oilfields (Regulation and Development) Amendment Bill, bringing major changes in the industrial laws governing large furnaces and boilers and the petroleum sector. Other than the Appropriation Bills as part of the supplementary demands for grants, the Lok Sabha discussed and passed the Banking Laws (Amendment) Bill, the Railways (Amendment) Bill and the Disaster Management (Amendment) Bill. The debates saw Opposition members asking the government to protect the public sector banking system, ensure the safety of rail passengers and employees and bring in transparency in the allocation of funds to States hit by natural calamities. The Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-Ninth Amendment) Bill and the Union Territories Laws (Amendment) Bill, that aim to achieve simultaneous elections in the country, were introduced and referred to a Joint Committee of Parliament. External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar made statements in both Houses on India-China relations. The winter session demonstrated the need for an urgent restoration of parliamentary norms and basic decency in exchanges between political opponents.

> Parliament's productivity is crucial for addressing national issues, but recent sessions have been marred by disruptions, personal attacks, and political bickering. These distractions sidetrack meaningful legislative debates, delaying critical policymaking and reforms. The confrontational environment undermines public trust in the institution and affects governance. To restore efficiency, all political parties must prioritize constructive dialogue over partisan conflicts. Focused discussions, adherence to rules, and mutual respect among members are essential to uphold the sanctity of Parliament. A more productive and collaborative approach will ensure that the legislative process serves the people effectively and strengthens democratic institutions.

# Stormy Winter Session ends with dismal output 

### Impact of a Stormy Winter Session on Indian Democracy

The recently concluded Winter Session of Parliament, marked by low productivity and heightened tensions, underscores significant challenges for Indian democracy. A session that should have been a platform for robust debate and policymaking devolved into chaos, highlighting deep divisions within the political landscape. Key events such as a no-confidence motion against the Rajya Sabha Chairman, allegations of insults to B.R. Ambedkar, and several breach of privilege notices not only disrupted the session but also raised concerns about the functioning of the democratic process.

#### The Role of Parliament in Democracy

Parliament is the cornerstone of India’s democratic framework, where elected representatives deliberate on laws, policies, and the concerns of citizens. Its effective functioning is essential for transparency, accountability, and representation. Low productivity, frequent disruptions, and unresolved conflicts hinder its ability to fulfill these objectives, impacting the broader democratic process.

#### Events of the Winter Session

1. **No-Confidence Motion Against the Rajya Sabha Chairman**: The introduction of a no-confidence motion against the Chairman reflected the growing discord between the ruling and opposition parties. While the motion was symbolic and lacked the numbers to succeed, it pointed to a loss of trust in the presiding officer, further polarizing the political landscape.

2. **Protests Over Alleged Insults to B.R. Ambedkar**: Protests erupted over accusations that ruling party members had insulted Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, a key architect of the Constitution. This led to heated exchanges and a walkout by opposition members, diverting attention from legislative work and creating a narrative of divisiveness.

3. **Breach of Privilege Notices**: The session saw a surge in breach of privilege notices, as both ruling and opposition parties accused each other of misconduct. These notices further entrenched hostilities, making it difficult to focus on substantive issues.

4. **Low Productivity**: The overall output of the Winter Session was dismal, with only a handful of bills debated and passed. The session was marred by frequent adjournments and walkouts, leaving key legislative agendas unaddressed.

#### Impact on Democracy

1. **Erosion of Trust**: The confrontational nature of the session eroded public trust in Parliament as an institution. When political representatives prioritize personal or party agendas over constructive debate, it weakens the democratic fabric.

2. **Loss of Accountability**: Parliament serves as a forum for holding the government accountable. Disruptions and walkouts mean reduced scrutiny of executive decisions, enabling unchecked governance.

3. **Divisiveness and Polarization**: The session highlighted the deep ideological and political divides between parties. Such polarization hampers collaborative governance, making it harder to address national challenges effectively.

4. **Missed Opportunities for Policy Making**: With low productivity, key legislation remains pending, delaying reforms and affecting citizens’ lives. This undermines the principle of representation, as elected officials fail to deliver on their mandates.

#### The Way Forward

To mitigate these impacts, there is a need for institutional reforms to ensure the smooth functioning of Parliament. Measures like stricter enforcement of rules, greater dialogue between parties, and promoting a culture of consensus can help reduce disruptions. Additionally, fostering public awareness about the importance of legislative productivity can pressure political leaders to act responsibly.

#### Conclusion

A stormy Winter Session with dismal output reflects poorly on Indian democracy, underscoring the urgent need for greater cooperation and accountability among political leaders. While disagreements and debates are integral to a vibrant democracy, they should not come at the cost of Parliament’s functionality. It is imperative for all stakeholders to uphold the sanctity of the institution and prioritize the nation’s interests over partisan politics.
