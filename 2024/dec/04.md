# Considered proposals for inclusion of 365 groups on Central OBC list, says govt.

The inclusion of communities into the Central List of Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in India is a structured process involving constitutional provisions and systematic evaluation. Here's an overview:

**1. Constitutional Framework:**

- **Article 15(4):** Empowers the State to make special provisions for the advancement of socially and educationally backward classes, including reservations in educational institutions.

- **Article 16(4):** Allows the State to provide reservations in public employment for any backward class that is not adequately represented in the services under the State.

- **Article 338B:** Establishes the National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC) as a constitutional body to investigate and monitor safeguards for socially and educationally backward classes.

- **Article 342A:** Authorizes the President to specify socially and educationally backward classes in various states and union territories, in consultation with the respective Governor. Amendments to this list require parliamentary approval.

**2. Procedure for Inclusion:**

- **State Government Proposal:** The process begins at the state level, where communities seeking inclusion are assessed. The respective State or Union Territory government compiles proposals, substantiated with data on the social, economic, and educational backwardness of the communities, and forwards them to the NCBC.

- **NCBC Examination:** The NCBC evaluates these proposals, considering factors like social and educational backwardness, representation in public employment, and other relevant criteria. The Commission may conduct public hearings, field studies, and consult stakeholders to ensure a comprehensive assessment.

- **Recommendation to the Central Government:** Upon thorough examination, the NCBC makes recommendations to the Central Government regarding the inclusion or exclusion of communities in the Central OBC list.

- **Cabinet Approval and Legislation:** The Central Government reviews the NCBC's recommendations. If accepted, the proposal is placed before the Union Cabinet. Following Cabinet approval, a bill is introduced in Parliament to amend the Central List of OBCs.

- **Presidential Notification:** Once Parliament passes the amendment, it is sent to the President for assent. After the President's approval, an official notification is issued, and the community is formally included in the Central OBC list.

**3. Recent Developments:**

The government has considered proposals for the inclusion of 365 groups in the Central OBC list. This reflects ongoing efforts to ensure that socially and educationally backward communities receive appropriate recognition and benefits.

**4. Significance of Inclusion:**

Inclusion in the Central OBC list enables communities to access various affirmative action benefits, such as reservations in educational institutions and public employment, scholarships, and other welfare schemes aimed at promoting social and economic advancement.

**5. Challenges and Considerations:**

- **Data Validation:** Accurate and comprehensive data on the backwardness of communities is crucial for informed decision-making.

- **Political and Social Dynamics:** The inclusion or exclusion of communities can have significant political and social implications, necessitating careful and unbiased evaluation.

- **Judicial Scrutiny:** Decisions regarding inclusion are subject to judicial review to ensure compliance with constitutional provisions and prevent arbitrary actions.

**6. Role of the NCBC:**

The NCBC plays a pivotal role in this process. As a constitutional body under Article 338B, it is tasked with investigating matters related to the safeguards for socially and educationally backward classes, advising on their socio-economic development, and evaluating the progress of their advancement. The Commission's recommendations are instrumental in shaping policies and ensuring that deserving communities receive the benefits intended for their upliftment.

**Conclusion:**

The inclusion of communities in the Central OBC list is a meticulous process designed to uphold the constitutional mandate of promoting social justice. It involves collaboration between state governments, the NCBC, the Central Government, and Parliament, ensuring that only those communities that meet the established criteria are granted the benefits aimed at their development.

> The inclusion of communities in India’s Central OBC list involves a structured process to ensure social justice. It begins with state governments evaluating and proposing eligible communities based on their social and educational backwardness. The National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC) examines these proposals through data analysis, public consultations, and field studies. Recommendations are forwarded to the Central Government, reviewed by the Union Cabinet, and introduced as a bill in Parliament. Upon parliamentary approval and presidential assent, the community is added to the list. This enables access to benefits like reservations and welfare schemes, addressing systemic inequalities and promoting inclusion.

# Takeaways from COP29

Two major global events took place last month: the G20 Summit in Brazil and the 29th Conference of the Parties (COP29) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in Baku, Azerbaijan. Catalysing finance to address climate change was a central theme at both events. The deal reached in Baku, though hard-won, falls short of expectations.

To be fair, the expectations for climate finance were never easy to meet. Assessments had shown that developing countries need $1.3 trillion per year through 2035 to build infrastructure for adapting to climate change; investing in clean energy, land use, and urban development to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; and recovering from disasters. This amount was to come from the 24 high-income countries listed in Annex I of the UNFCCC. Given the outlook of slow economic growth, green investments required in their own territories, and the likelihood of the U.S., which accounts for half of cumulative federal spending, pulling back, there was little appetite for a significant commitment.

The biggest disappointment, however, is that even the small commitment made — $300 billion per year — does not come entirely from public finance, but from sources including Multilateral Development Banks, carbon markets, and private finance. It is recognised that private finance tends to flow to economies where returns are commercially attractive, and it can easily shift back to advanced economies when conditions change. This creates uncertainty about whether emerging economies will see much benefit. Even larger economies like India are unlikely to get adequate resources for priorities such as adaptation.

That said, there were significant victories as well. The set of agreements on carbon markets concluded a decade of negotiations. While bilateral carbon credit deals between countries had been taking place under Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement, COP29 clarified the procedures for authorising these credits, their transferability between registries, and the standards needed to ensure their environmental integrity. This prevents credits from being revoked and investment getting stranded. A bigger win was the move towards implementing a global carbon market under Article 6.4, with several procedural rules agreed upon. The swift adoption of these rules by individual countries is crucial to launching this market, which will help direct capital towards the most efficient emission reduction projects worldwide. India is likely to be a major beneficiary in this regard.

Other positive outcomes included new emission reduction pledges from the European Union, Canada, and other regions. Many nations committed to propose steeper 2035 targets in their revised Nationally Determined Contributions than their current commitments. The U.K. and Brazil have announced their updated targets, while Norway is consulting on its own. Mexico, under the leadership of climate scientist Claudia Sheinbaum, became the latest major economy to announce a goal to reach net zero by 2050. At the G20 Summit, Indonesian President Probowo Subianto unveiled an ambitious plan to retire all coal and fossil fuel-fired plants by 2040. This is significant, as Indonesia is the largest exporter and third-largest consumer of coal globally. It also highlights that the focus on coal is back — a challenge that India staved off in previous COPs in order to ensure that the focus remained on all fossil fuels. The lack of progress on the “phase-out” of all fossil fuels at both COP29 and the G20 Summit is a cause for concern.

Should we acknowledge that the battle to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C has likely been lost, and adopt a more realistic target? A study released before COP29 indicated that the world was already 1.49°C warmer than pre-industrial levels by the end of 2023. Another suggests that there are still pathways to reverse temperature rise within the 1.5°C limit, even with a temporary overshoot. But this would require the removal of several hundred gigatonnes of carbon using untested carbon removal technologies. At present, large-scale investment in these technologies is not being seriously discussed. Despite this, the 1.5°C goal remains a key leverage point for developing countries, which use it to push for more financial support, and for large economies to take more aggressive steps to cut emissions. There are pros and cons to abandoning the 1.5°C target. It deserves serious thought.

> COP29 in Baku brought mixed results. A key outcome was the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG), targeting $300 billion annually in climate finance by 2035, though it falls short of the $1.3 trillion needed by developing nations. Progress included finalizing carbon market rules under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, fostering international cooperation on emissions trading. However, limited advancements on phasing out fossil fuels and addressing loss and damage disappointed vulnerable countries. The conference highlighted the increasing reliance on private finance and the urgency of local action to bridge the gap between global commitments and the realities of climate challenges.

# Local action amidst global inertia

After hours of intense negotiations, the **29th Conference of the Parties (COP29)** to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) ended with a climate finance goal where developed countries are to provide **$300 billion annually by 2035**. However, this is far from what the developing countries need, and once again brings global climate gridlock into the spotlight.

### Reaching a consensus

The notion that developed countries should finance climate action in developing nations while also ramping up their own mitigation efforts (such as taking the lead in phasing out fossil fuels and reaching net zero emissions faster) is accepted in principle, but has proven contentious to implement across COPs. The developed world continues to use fossil fuels to meet most of its demands and has no plans of reaching net zero before mid-century. The deadlock has remained a recurring theme at climate negotiations, and COP29 was unsurprisingly no exception. The powerful fossil fuel lobby, especially the oil and gas lobby; the developed world’s heavy reliance on fossil fuels; the re-election of climate change deniers; and the differential impacts of climate change across the globe (with the developing world more likely to be impacted than others) are all challenges that hinder reaching a consensus.

Global negotiations are not useless. On the contrary, they are extremely important, even if the victories are few and far between. For instance, the **Montreal Protocol**, which came into force in 1989, has successfully helped protect the ozone layer and eliminate certain chemicals used in refrigeration (chlorofluorocarbons), a significant contributor to the depletion of the ozone layer. Similarly, the **Kyoto Protocol**, the first global accord on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which came into force in 2005; the 2015 Paris Agreement, a consensus on limiting global warming to below 2°C with revised national targets every five years; and the 2021 Glasgow Climate Pact, which introduced a loss and damage fund and in which nations declared their respective net-zero dates, are some COPs to celebrate.

However, unlike the melting of glaciers, the pace of action has been slow. Studies indicate that the 1.5°C target will be breached within a few years, with one study even suggesting that it has already been exceeded. Scientific evidence warns that crossing this threshold will lead to severe consequences in terms of natural disasters and heat stress, which are already apparent across the world. In some instances, the changes expected are unknown and could be catastrophic. Further, studies also point to the fact that the earth’s climate will continue to evolve even after global net zero is reached, but the longer we take to get there, the more significant the impact of climate change will be.

### India’s efforts

Whether the goal is to limit global temperature rise to 1.5-2°C or condemn political aggressors for starting wars, the rate at which action is needed is exponential, but the rate at which it is realistically possible is incremental at best. How then do we reconcile these different scales (exponential versus incremental rates) of action? Our answer is to focus efforts on national and sub-national-level action. In India, several policies and finance have already been put in place towards clean energy transition, assuming that international climate finance contribution will be minimal. Being a developing country with several challenges, India has largely followed the co-benefits approach in addressing climate change. For instance, the **PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana** provides households with subsidies to install rooftop solar panels, thereby also addressing energy poverty and access. The PM Electric Drive Revolution in Innovative Vehicle Enhancement **(PM E-DRIVE)** initiative aims to promote the adoption of zero-emission vehicles, including two-wheelers, three-wheelers, ambulances, and trucks, offering purchase subsidies and supporting essential charging infrastructure to accelerate the transition to clean air and clean transportation. The Perform, Achieve, and Trade (PAT) scheme, soon to be replaced by the Indian Carbon Market, helps mobilise investments needed to improve energy efficiency and emissions reduction in industries. It is important to note that India has been working hard on reducing its emissions intensity (CO2 per unit of GDP) as per its commitment to the Paris Agreement. Further, in addition to strategies for emissions mitigation, State Action Plans on Climate Change support adaptation strategies tailored to specific vulnerabilities of States, with a focus on agriculture, forestry, water resources, and disaster risk reduction.

While global consensus and funding remain elusive, local and national actions are making tangible progress. The hullabaloo around COPs from “non-parties” is less crucial than the need to drive action on the ground. India deserves praise for already taking steps in the right direction. Moving forward, sustained efforts in emissions mitigation, mindful consumption aligned with **Mission LiFE**, a greater emphasis on developing resilient infrastructure and communities, and implementing effective heat action plans to address extreme heat will be essential.

> Amid global inaction and limited progress at COP29 in Baku, local actions have gained prominence in addressing climate challenges. While international negotiations struggled to secure adequate funding and commitments for developing nations, communities and local governments are implementing innovative climate solutions. Grassroots initiatives focus on renewable energy adoption, reforestation, sustainable agriculture, and disaster preparedness. Cities worldwide are setting ambitious emission reduction targets, often surpassing national efforts. Although COP29’s outcomes, such as the NCQG, offer some hope, the gap between global promises and action underscores the importance of localized efforts in driving tangible progress against climate change.

# India, China have set ties on right track: Jaishankar

### India-China Relations: Towards Improvement Amid Challenges

India and China, two of Asia’s largest and most influential nations, share a complex relationship shaped by historical ties, economic engagements, and geopolitical tensions. External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar's recent statement in Parliament highlights a cautious optimism regarding a gradual improvement in bilateral relations, driven by diplomatic efforts and step-by-step disengagement in contested border areas.

---

### **Background of the Current Tensions**

The relationship between India and China has been significantly strained since the 2020 Galwan Valley clash, where 20 Indian soldiers and an undisclosed number of Chinese soldiers lost their lives. This marked the first fatal encounter in the region in over four decades, intensifying tensions along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). The standoff extended to other areas like Pangong Tso and Depsang, with China amassing troops and infrastructure in contested regions.

These actions disrupted the previously fragile peace along the border, making the situation "abnormal," as described by Jaishankar. Economic relations were also affected, with India restricting Chinese investments and banning numerous Chinese apps, reflecting broader concerns over national security and sovereignty.

---

### **Steps Towards Improvement**

1. **Continuous Diplomatic Engagement:**
   - India and China have maintained a dialogue through diplomatic and military channels, such as the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on Border Affairs and Corps Commander-level talks.
   - These engagements have facilitated agreements on disengagement in areas like the Galwan Valley and Pangong Tso, though progress remains slow and localized.

2. **Step-by-Step Approach:**
   - Jaishankar emphasized that resolving border disputes is a gradual process requiring trust-building measures and adherence to agreements.
   - Both sides have agreed to disengage troops in sensitive areas, demonstrating a commitment to avoiding further escalation.

3. **Economic and Trade Considerations:**
   - Despite tensions, trade between India and China has remained robust, with China being one of India's largest trading partners.
   - The economic interdependence offers a stabilizing factor, urging both nations to manage conflicts prudently.

---

### **Challenges in the Path to Normalcy**

1. **Border Disputes:**
   - The lack of a clearly demarcated border and differing interpretations of the LAC continue to be the primary source of friction.
   - China’s aggressive infrastructure development in contested regions exacerbates mistrust.

2. **Strategic Rivalry:**
   - Both nations compete for regional influence in South Asia and the Indo-Pacific, where India aligns with initiatives like the Quad, countering China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).

3. **Economic Concerns:**
   - India's concerns over trade imbalances and Chinese investments in sensitive sectors persist, alongside a broader push for self-reliance under initiatives like "Aatmanirbhar Bharat."

4. **Global Geopolitical Dynamics:**
   - China's proximity to Pakistan and its stance on Kashmir add layers of complexity to bilateral ties.

---

### **Way Forward**

1. **Sustained Dialogue:**
   - Continued engagement at both diplomatic and military levels is essential to resolve border issues and restore mutual trust.

2. **Adherence to Agreements:**
   - Respecting previously signed agreements on border management will help de-escalate tensions.

3. **Balancing Competition and Cooperation:**
   - While strategic rivalry persists, areas of mutual interest like climate change, trade, and multilateral cooperation should be leveraged for constructive engagement.

---

### **Conclusion**

India-China ties are at a delicate juncture. While recent steps indicate a "direction of improvement," long-standing issues, particularly along the LAC, require sustained efforts to achieve a stable and mutually beneficial relationship. Through cautious diplomacy and pragmatic measures, both nations can work towards transforming their rivalry into a more balanced coexistence, essential for regional and global stability.

> India-China relations are cautiously improving through continuous diplomatic engagement and step-by-step disengagement in contested border areas. Tensions escalated after the 2020 Galwan Valley clash, resulting in an "abnormal" situation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). Recent talks have led to troop withdrawals in some areas, fostering gradual trust-building. Challenges remain, including unresolved border disputes, strategic rivalry in the Indo-Pacific, and economic concerns like trade imbalances. To restore normalcy, both nations must sustain dialogue, adhere to agreements, and balance competition with cooperation in areas like trade and climate change. Pragmatic diplomacy is key to achieving stable, mutually beneficial ties.

# Reflections on Baku’s ‘NCQG outcome’

The urgency of climate change has never been more evident. The **Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)** has highlighted the need for significantly stronger commitments to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. Current policies, if continued globally, are expected to lead to a temperature rise of up to 3.1°C. The increasingly visible impacts of climate change across geographies, apart from the growing body of scientific evidence, serve as a constant reminder of the need to accelerate climate action. Cleaner fuels and technological solutions are emerging across sectors and could be increasingly accessed and deployed with adequate focus on the means of implementation.

Against this backdrop with **COP 29** (in Baku, Azerbaijan, in November 2024) branded as the “Finance COP”, the hope was to see an ambitious outcome (specifically related to the NCQG or New Collective Quantified Goal) which strongly supported this understanding.

### Financing needs of the developing world

Finance is a critical component in accelerating the adoption of cleaner alternatives, especially in developing countries. While some of the renewable technologies pay off in the long run due to lower fuel and operational costs, the upfront costs of some of these technologies are much higher than the current options requiring government support to ensure affordability at the consumer end. Other green technologies may still be evolving and are associated with risks of failure that front-runners may need to bear. Given the pressure on government resources that need to be prioritised towards development activities, additional finance must be up-scaled urgently within this decade if transformational changes are to be expected in the adoption of clean and efficient alternatives in developing countries, as access to modern energy and infrastructure improves.

India’s expenditure on green energy schemes encompass a wide range of initiatives aimed at expanding renewable energy infrastructure, promoting energy efficiency and clean fuel and technology innovations as part of its commitment to global climate goals. MNRE received its highest ever allocation of ₹19,100 crore in the Budget 2024-25, apart from about ₹40 crore being allocated for enhancing energy efficiency. In the transport sector, a subsidy of ₹5,790 crore has been provided to electric vehicle manufacturers under phase-II of Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid) Electric vehicles (FAME) scheme.

Another aspect of finance required for the transition relates to the source and type of finance. There are growing concerns regarding fiscal debt, which forms the basis of the ask, for part of the financial support from developed countries to be in the form of public grants rather than loans.

The pace and the scale of transitions are also affected by the higher cost of capital in developing countries. Financial flows from developed countries must ideally aim to strengthen fiscal capacities and enable the unlocking of financial markets in developing countries to support and accelerate their climate action. The use of debt instruments to access finance does not work well for developing countries since their high debt burdens limit their ability to successfully incentivise domestic private capital for climate action. It is well recognised that developing countries attract much higher lending rates as compared to developed countries and much of the global financial flows are restricted within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. Therefore, ensuring the flow of climate finance to developing countries at affordable lending rates is important.

### Role of the NCQG

At Cancun, in 2010, developed countries had pledged to provide $100 billion annually upto 2020. Further, at COP21 in Paris, the parties decided to establish an NCQG prior to 2025, with the Cancun commitment as the base point. The rationale for establishing the NCQG was pressing. The existing climate pledges have generally been criticised for their lack of specificity and accountability.

Therefore, the NCQG was intended to create a framework for shared climate goals, to establish clear and quantified objectives that nations could aim to achieve, with transparency and accountability at the forefront. At COP26 at Glasgow in 2021, an ad hoc work programme for NCQG discussions was established to run from 2022-24, culminating towards the discussions at COP29.

The Second Needs Determination Report by the Standing Committee on Finance under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) estimated that between $5 trillion to $7 trillion would be needed by 2030 to meet half the needs of 98 countries. Developing countries had put forward a conservative ask of $1.3 trillion annually at COP 29 (largely from public sources to enable leveraging the rest through private finance).

However, the developed world has in the NCQG agreed to provide an abysmal figure of $300 billion annually till 2035. This quantum is not only miniscule but hardly represents any major change in real flows — probably a target that could be achieved even with current or minimally additional efforts, if we account for inflation. Further, the mobilisation of funds is expected through all sources of finance including private capital. Undoubtedly, therefore, there is disappointment with the NCQG outcome, both on the quantum and structure of finance since it does not support the narrative of transformative action. While the decision to triple the flow of public resources through various operating entities of the Financial Mechanism, the Adaptation Fund, the Least Developed Countries Fund, and the Special Climate Change Fund from the 2023 level by 2035 is a positive aspect, it could also see rather slow progress in the next few years (and not aligned to the narrative of the urgency in climate action).

### The road ahead

COP29 saw the finance commitment step up from the earlier commitment of $100 billion a year to $300 billion a year. While this is a step in the correct direction, it is clearly not as ambitious as expected given that climate change is clearly recognised as one of the greatest threats and challenges of our time. Overall, the NCQG outcome is rather disappointing and does not seem to have aligned well with the very core of why the goal was set up in the first place. It clearly bypasses the principles of equitable burden sharing and climate justice as it fails to recognise the financial needs of the global south.

The way forward is to keep the talks ongoing. Climate change has no geographical boundaries. Thus, it is imperative that the international community cooperates towards the global good, keeping climate justice at the core and respecting the principles of the Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR and RC). Developing countries must stick together and ensure that any transition is just and fair in the real sense.

> The 29th UN Climate Change Conference (COP29) in Baku, Azerbaijan, concluded with the establishment of a New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) on climate finance, aiming to mobilize at least $300 billion annually by 2035. This target, though triple the previous $100 billion goal, falls short of the $1.3 trillion per year that developing countries require to effectively address climate change. The NCQG encompasses diverse funding sources, including public, private, bilateral, and multilateral contributions, with developed nations expected to lead these efforts. However, the reliance on private finance raises concerns about the adequacy and reliability of support for vulnerable nations. The conference also finalized rules for carbon markets under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, yet progress on phasing out fossil fuels remained limited. Overall, while COP29 achieved some advancements, the outcomes are viewed as insufficient to meet the pressing climate challenges faced by developing countries.
