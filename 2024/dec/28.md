# Marginalised by caste, marginalised in education

Atul Kumar, the son of a daily wage worker and from the Scheduled Caste community, lost his seat at IIT Dhanbad after he was unable to pay the seat booking fee of ₹17,500 that was required to secure his admission. His case gained widespread attention on social media, prompting the Supreme Court of India to intervene by exercising its extraordinary powers under Article 142 to grant him admission. There are many and similar cases like Atul’s, but which never draw media attention or receive justice, leaving many deserving students without opportunities due to financial constraints and systemic inequalities.

The rise in tuition fees

The struggles that Dalit students face echo the challenges of pre-Independence India when they were barred from enrolling in educational institutions because of their caste. While these historical restrictions were overt, the situation now is more insidious. Under the “Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan”, the Government of India has been pushing for self-reliance in institutions, leading to a significant increase in fees in many government colleges and universities such as the Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT), the Indian Institutes of Management, the central universities, and the National Law University. For instance, in 2016, the IIT council’s standing committee agreed to increase the undergraduate tuition fees by 200%. This meant a fee increase from ₹90,000 to ₹3 lakh a year.

In response to the criticism regarding the fee increase, the committee set up by the government asserted that students from marginalised communities would benefit from the Vidyalakshmi scheme, which offers interest-free scholarships. However, while this initiative aims to provide support, it remains insufficient to fully address the financial challenges faced by these students, especially as fees continue to rise. The hike in fees that was implemented in seven IIMs including increased tuition fees; IIM-Lucknow hiked it by nearly 30%, IIM-Ahmedabad and IIM-Shillong by 5%, IIM Lucknow by 29.6%, IIM-Calcutta by 17.3%, IIM-Kozhikode by 23.1%, IIM-Ranchi by 19% and IIM-Tiruchirappalli by 20%. IIT-Delhi increased tuition fees for full-time M.Tech students in the semester in 2022-23. The total academic fee is now ₹53,100, which does not include hostel fees. This is a 100% increase from last year’s fee of ₹26,450.

The frequent hikes in fees have made it increasingly difficult for students from the marginalised communities to afford higher education or even pursue studies through loans. With rising costs in the Indian education system, many students from the marginalised communities are unable to even consider enrolling in prestigious institutions such as the IITs and the IIMs despite securing competitive ranks. As a result, while some students manage to cope with the financial burden, there are others who are overwhelmed by the stress and the inequality in academic institutions. This pressure, exacerbated by the high cost of education, has a human angle too. In 2021, data showed that over the past seven years, 122 students from the IITs and the IIMs had ended their lives, many due to the financial strain of rising fees and the anxiety of securing employment.

The issue of dropouts

Another harsh reality is that many students who manage to enrol themselves in prestigious institutions eventually drop out due to their inability to afford rising education fees. The Human Resources Development Ministry reported that 2,461 students dropped out of IITs in just two years (2017 and 2018). Last year, this issue was raised in the Lok Sabha, revealing that over the past five years, more than 13,500 students from the Scheduled Castes (SC), the Scheduled Tribes (ST), and Other Backward Classes (OBC) had dropped out of courses in the central universities, the IITs and the IIMs. Government data showed that in the central universities, 4,596 students from the Other Backward Classes, 2,424 SC students, and 2,622 ST students dropped out during this period. In the IITs, 2,066 OBC students, 1,068 SC students, and 408 ST students left. Similarly, the IIMs saw 163 OBC, 188 SC, and 91 ST students drop out over the past five years. These numbers highlight the significant challenges faced by marginalised communities in accessing and sustaining higher education in India.

One of the key reasons behind the poor economic conditions of the Dalit community is that their identity in India is still largely defined by caste. Dalits continue to be denied the opportunity to perform work that is on a par with others in society. This has not only left them economically marginalised but also socially vulnerable. Dalits in India are considered an oppressed and discriminated class, often labelled as “untouchable”. Historically, this stigmatisation has meant that Dalits have been denied access to education. The term “untouchables” also refers to those who have been forced into the most undesirable and degrading jobs. A recent survey in 29 States on urban sewer and septic tank workers revealed that 92% of these workers belong to Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), and Other Backward Classes (OBC). A 2019 report by former Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal revealed that 95% of faculty positions in IITs were held by individuals from upper caste backgrounds, with only 5% allocated to SC, ST, and OBC categories, despite these groups representing 70%-80% of India’s population. An RTI filed by IIT-Bombay students further exposed the disparities, showing that 24 departments had no SC faculty, 15 lacked ST representation, and nine had no OBC faculty. These statistics highlight the deep-rooted caste-based inequalities that persist in both employment and education.

The barriers still exist

After Independence, with provisions in the Constitution and welfare mechanisms, Dalit school enrolment rates have improved over time However, Dalit children continue to face significant barriers in education, including poverty, social discrimination, and caste-based prejudice. Dalit students are often judged based on their clothes, language, and other markers, making it difficult for them to integrate with their upper caste peers.

In many cases, caste-based remarks and discrimination wound these students, leading to social isolation. Some students succumb to the emotional toll of this prejudice — there are cases such as a woman postgraduate medical student in a medical college in Maharashtra and two students from IIT Bombay and IIT Delhi that are painful reminders of this reality. These incidents underscore the persistent shadow of casteism and harassment over the aspirations of many Dalit students. This troubling situation raises a critical question: how can these prestigious institutions effectively address this issue and foster a safe, inclusive environment for all students?

The unfortunate incidents of student suicides point to the immense pressure students face in the education system. Many students are burdened by their families’ expectations that completing a degree will solve their economic problems. But unemployment in India is also high. An RTI filed in 2024 about IIT placements showed that approximately 8,000 students (38%) across 23 IIT campuses remained unplaced this year. For students from the marginalised communities, this struggle is even more pronounced, as their caste identity often doubles the challenges they face in securing jobs. These issues underscore the pressing need for systemic reforms in education and employment to alleviate the pressures on students and address caste-based disparities.

> Caste-based marginalization significantly impacts access to education for disadvantaged communities in India. Structural inequalities and social discrimination hinder enrollment, retention, and performance, perpetuating cycles of poverty and exclusion. Marginalized groups often face inadequate educational infrastructure, poor teacher attitudes, and limited representation in curricula, reinforcing societal biases. Policies like reservations and mid-day meal schemes have improved access, but systemic barriers persist. Bridging this gap requires inclusive policies, improved school infrastructure, and sensitization programs to tackle caste prejudices. Empowering marginalized communities through education is essential to achieving equity, social justice, and sustainable development in India.

# Letter and spirit

The recent shift in education policy, mandating final examinations at the end of Class 5 and Class 8 with the possibility of detaining underperforming students, represents a significant change in the approach to addressing gaps in foundational learning outcomes. However, this decision raises critical concerns, especially in light of the objectives of the **National Education Policy (NEP) 2020**.

---

### **Analysis of the Policy Shift**

#### **1. Rationale Behind the Change**
   - The change aims to address the persistent learning crisis in India, where many students lack foundational literacy and numeracy skills by the end of primary and middle school.
   - By instituting final examinations, the government seeks to enforce accountability and ensure that students meet minimum learning standards before progressing to higher grades.

---

#### **2. Key Issues with the New Policy**

##### **a. Return to Summative Assessment**
   - The policy reintroduces **single, high-stakes exams** as the arbiter of promotion or detention.
   - This approach contrasts with modern educational philosophies and the NEP 2020, which advocate for **formative assessments** that evaluate students' growth continuously, providing a more comprehensive picture of their learning journey.

##### **b. Mismatch with NEP 2020 Goals**
   - The NEP emphasizes a **holistic, 360-degree progress card** and formative assessments focusing on self-reflection, peer evaluation, and multidimensional learning outcomes.
   - The detention policy’s reliance on final exams undermines the NEP’s emphasis on reducing stress and promoting creativity, critical thinking, and conceptual understanding.

##### **c. Risks of Expulsion and Inequality**
   - While the rules prohibit expelling students before completing elementary education, there is a risk that private schools might use poor performance as a pretext to exclude underperforming or disadvantaged students, further exacerbating inequality.
   - Safeguards to protect vulnerable students are crucial to prevent this.

##### **d. Political and Implementation Challenges**
   - For some states, particularly those with weak educational infrastructure or politically sensitive constituencies, implementing the detention policy could prove contentious.
   - The policy could exacerbate existing disparities between private schools, which are better equipped to adapt, and public schools, which face resource constraints.

##### **e. Potential for Negative Outcomes**
   - The reintroduction of detention may demotivate students and increase dropouts, especially in marginalized communities where additional learning support may not be readily available.
   - It risks creating a punitive learning environment rather than fostering curiosity and engagement.

---

#### **3. Broader Implications**

##### **a. Role of Society**
   - The learning outcomes gap is not just a failure of schools but a **collective societal issue** involving parents, communities, and policymakers.
   - Addressing systemic issues such as teacher shortages, inadequate infrastructure, and socio-economic barriers is essential.

##### **b. Impact on Demographic Dividend**
   - India’s ability to harness its demographic dividend depends on creating a skilled and capable workforce.
   - Overemphasis on high-stakes examinations without robust support mechanisms could fail to achieve the desired improvement in educational outcomes.

---

### **Recommendations**

1. **Align Policy with NEP 2020 Goals**:
   - Replace single final exams with **continuous and comprehensive evaluation (CCE)** to assess learning holistically.
   - Focus on personalized and multidimensional progress reports.

2. **Strengthen Foundational Learning**:
   - Invest in **early intervention programs** for literacy and numeracy skills, especially in underperforming schools and regions.
   - Provide remedial support and additional resources for struggling students.

3. **Teacher Training and Infrastructure**:
   - Strengthen teacher capacity through regular training in formative assessment methods and classroom innovation.
   - Address resource gaps in public schools to reduce disparities with private institutions.

4. **Protect Vulnerable Students**:
   - Enforce safeguards to prevent private schools from expelling underperforming or disadvantaged students.
   - Develop inclusive policies to support marginalized communities.

5. **Community and Parental Involvement**:
   - Promote greater collaboration between schools, parents, and communities to create a supportive learning environment.
   - Launch awareness campaigns to educate stakeholders on the importance of holistic development.

---

### **Conclusion**

While the intention to improve learning outcomes is commendable, the new detention policy represents a regression from progressive educational approaches advocated by the NEP 2020. High-stakes examinations alone cannot address systemic educational challenges and may lead to unintended consequences such as increased dropouts and inequities. To truly reform education, India must adopt a holistic approach that aligns with modern pedagogical practices, invests in foundational learning, and prioritizes inclusivity and equity. Balancing accountability with the NEP’s vision for nurturing creativity and critical thinking is crucial for long-term success.

> The recent notification of the Ministry of Education has removed the discretion given to State governments. It has mandated a final examination at the end of Class 5 and Class 8, which will assess a child’s competence. If he or she is not found to be competent, the child will be re-examined after two months after additional instruction. If the child fails again, he or she will be detained. The rules say no child should be expelled before completing elementary education. Practical necessity is driving this change in norms. Steps do need to be taken to address the gap in the learning outcomes achievement. An educated, capable and skilled population is needed to reap the demographic dividend. It takes an entire neighbourhood to educate a child, not just the school and parents. The dismal situation in learning outcomes is a collective failure of society that needs to be addressed. But it would take a lot more than this particular change in policy to trigger a turnaround. CBSE-affiliated and other private schools can easily implement the new policy. However, for some States, it will be a political hot potato. Private schools should not use this as an excuse to expel poor performing students — safeguards would be needed. A sad consequence of the policy is that it brings back a single final examination as an arbiter of a child’s promotion or detention.

# Brahmaputra dam will not affect India, Bangladesh: China

The announcement of China’s plan to construct the world’s largest dam on the Brahmaputra River in Tibet has raised significant concerns among the lower riparian states of India and Bangladesh. While China has assured that the project will not negatively impact these countries and that it has conducted decades of studies to address safety concerns, the geopolitical, environmental, and socio-economic implications warrant closer scrutiny.

---

### **Project Overview**

The proposed dam, part of China’s ambitious hydropower development strategy, is estimated to cost $137 billion. Located near the Indian border in the ecologically sensitive Himalayan region, it aims to harness the massive hydropower potential of the Brahmaputra River, known as the Yarlung Tsangpo in Tibet. This project is positioned in a region prone to seismic activity due to its location along a tectonic plate boundary, making safety a key issue.

China has emphasized the strategic significance of the dam, which aligns with its goals to boost renewable energy output and reduce reliance on fossil fuels. The dam is expected to generate substantial electricity, contributing to China’s carbon neutrality objectives.

---

### **Concerns of Lower Riparian States**

1. **Hydrological Impacts**:
   - India and Bangladesh depend heavily on the Brahmaputra for agriculture, drinking water, and fisheries. The flow of the river plays a critical role in sustaining livelihoods.
   - Dams in upstream regions can alter water flow, sediment transport, and seasonal flooding patterns, potentially causing water scarcity or excessive flooding downstream.

2. **Environmental Risks**:
   - The Himalayan region is an ecologically fragile zone with rich biodiversity. Large-scale construction projects in such areas can lead to deforestation, habitat loss, and disruption of local ecosystems.
   - The risk of landslides, soil erosion, and increased sedimentation in downstream regions is a significant environmental concern.

3. **Seismic Risks**:
   - The area’s location along a tectonic plate boundary makes it highly susceptible to earthquakes. A dam failure due to seismic activity could have catastrophic consequences for millions of people living downstream.

4. **Geopolitical Tensions**:
   - The dam’s proximity to India’s northeastern border adds a geopolitical dimension to the issue. India has expressed concerns about the potential for water diversion, which could impact its northeastern states.
   - Bangladesh, being the last riparian state, fears reduced water availability and the amplification of existing vulnerabilities related to flooding and water management.

5. **Transparency and Cooperation**:
   - China has not signed water-sharing agreements with India or Bangladesh for transboundary rivers. This lack of a formal framework creates mistrust regarding the project’s impact on downstream countries.

---

### **China’s Position**

China has downplayed apprehensions, asserting that the dam will not affect lower riparian states negatively. It has also emphasized that safety concerns have been addressed through extensive studies over decades. The Chinese government views the dam as a vital component of its renewable energy strategy and insists on its adherence to international norms.

---

### **Way Forward**

1. **Bilateral and Multilateral Engagement**:
   - India, Bangladesh, and China must engage in constructive dialogue to ensure that the project is managed in a way that minimizes downstream impacts.
   - Establishing a trilateral framework for information sharing, water flow data, and early warning systems can help build trust.

2. **International Mediation**:
   - The three nations could involve international organizations like the United Nations or regional bodies such as SAARC to mediate and ensure adherence to international water-sharing norms.

3. **Environmental Safeguards**:
   - Rigorous environmental impact assessments (EIAs) must be conducted, and downstream countries should be included in consultations to mitigate ecological risks.

4. **Strengthening Regional Cooperation**:
   - This project underscores the need for a robust regional agreement on the management of shared water resources in South Asia, focusing on equitable and sustainable usage.

---

### **Conclusion**

The construction of the world’s largest dam on the Brahmaputra represents a complex challenge that intertwines environmental, hydrological, and geopolitical dimensions. While China positions the project as a vital step toward its renewable energy goals, the concerns of India and Bangladesh regarding water security and ecological impacts cannot be overlooked. Transparent communication, cooperative frameworks, and adherence to international norms are critical to ensuring that the project does not exacerbate regional tensions or compromise the environmental and socio-economic well-being of millions dependent on the Brahmaputra River.

> China’s plan to build the world’s largest dam on the Brahmaputra River near the Indian border has raised significant concerns for India and Bangladesh. While China claims the $137-billion project will not harm lower riparian states, apprehensions include altered water flow, sediment transport, and increased flooding risks. Environmental and seismic concerns are critical, given the fragile Himalayan ecosystem and tectonic activity. Geopolitical tensions arise due to the absence of water-sharing agreements. To address these challenges, India, Bangladesh, and China must engage in transparent dialogue, establish cooperative frameworks, and prioritize environmental safeguards to balance development with regional water security and stability.
