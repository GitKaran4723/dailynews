# Money bill

The Constitution defines certain categories of bills that deal with financial matters as money Bills and financial Bills. **Article 110(1)(a) to (f)** defines a money Bill as a bill that contains "only" provisions dealing with one or more of six specific matters. 
- Taxation
- Borrowing by government
- Custody of consolidated fund or contingency fund and payment/withdrawal of money from such fund 
- Appropriation out of consolidated fund
- Expenditure charged on consolidated fund; 
- Receipt on account of consolidated fund or public account or the audit of accounts of Union or States. 
Clause **(g) of Article 110 (1)** provides that any matter incidental to these six matters can also be classified as a money Bill. Classic examples of money Bills include the **Finance Act and the Appropriation Act** that deal primarily ‘only’ with taxation and spending out of the consolidated fund respectively. **Article 117 provides for two different categories** of financial Bills. Category I contains any of the six matters mentioned in Article 110(1)(a) to (f) along with any other matter. **Category II Bills** do not contain any of those six matters but would involve expenditures from the consolidated fund.

### What is procedure for a money Bill?
As per **Article 109**, a money Bill shall be introduced only in the Lok Sabha. After it is passed in the Lok Sabha, the Rajya Sabha has only **14 days** to provide its recommendations on such a Bill which **may or may not be accepted by the Lok Sabha**. Money Bills deal "only" with financial matters that are crucial for the administration of the country. Hence, the Constitution provides for this special procedure that effectively requires only the approval of Lok Sabha where the ruling government enjoys a majority. **It has its origin in the U.K.**, where in 1911 the powers of the unelected House of Lords over the Budget were curtailed. The Budget was required to be passed only by the **House of Commons that reflected the will of the people**. However, it must be noted that the operative word of the definition of a money Bill is the word "only". It is the **Speaker of Lok Sabha** who certifies a Bill to be a money Bill.

Financial Bills of Category I and II do not enjoy this special procedure.

> Chief Justice of India has agreed to list before **Constitution benches**, the petitions challenging the money bill route taken by the Centre to pass contentiouslaws/ amendments.

# Heat Stress and Its Impact on Labour Efficiency and Productivity

Heat stress is anticipated to significantly affect labour efficiency and productivity by reducing work hours, thus hindering the **International Labour Organization's (ILO)** objective of promoting fair and decent employment. The primary health effects associated with heat stress include heat stroke, heat cramps, cardiovascular disease, acute kidney injury, and physical injury. The **Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)** has emphasized the necessity of maintaining a core body temperature of roughly **37 degrees Celsius** to avoid these adverse health outcomes.

Women, especially those **working in agriculture**, are particularly vulnerable to heat stress. Exposure to extreme heat can lead to pregnancy-related complications, including hypertension, miscarriages, and premature births. The ILO's 2019 study projects that heat stress will reduce total working hours worldwide by **2.2 percent and global GDP by US$2,400 billion by 2030**, with agriculture and construction workers being the most affected.

In India, the consistent increase in temperature poses a significant threat to labour productivity. Approximately **34 million people** in India are expected to experience job loss due to reduced productivity caused by heat stress. A case study from West Bengal highlighted that a 1% increase in temperature resulted in a corresponding 2% decrease in the productivity of **female brickmaking workers**. This effect extends to full-employment jobs, with informal workers and migrant workers being the most severely impacted.

To address these challenges, national guidelines titled ***Preparation of Action Plan-Prevention and Management of Heat Wave*** have been issued by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and the Ministry of Home Affairs. These guidelines aim to protect the Indian workforce from the negative impacts of heat stress by providing education to workers, ensuring proper hydration, managing work schedules, and offering necessary medical facilities.

During the International Labour **Conference in June 2023**, the General Discussion Committee highlighted the urgent need to implement measures to ensure the safety and health of workers impacted by climate-related risks and extreme weather events. Moving forward, it is essential to develop sufficient infrastructure and enhance early warning systems for extreme weather events. Improving labour codes and fostering effective communication between workers and employers to adjust working hours, provide rest breaks, offer training, and ensure access to drinking water are crucial steps.

In conclusion, it is crucial for all stakeholders, including governments, employers, and workers, to collaborate in implementing measures that prioritize the protection of the most vulnerable individuals. This collective effort will help mitigate the adverse effects of heat stress on labour efficiency and productivity, ensuring a safer and healthier working environment.

> Heat stress significantly impacts **labour efficiency and productivity**, leading to serious health consequences and economic losses. Women in agriculture are particularly vulnerable to heat-related complications. The ILO projects significant reductions in global working hours and GDP by 2030 due to heat stress, affecting millions in India alone. Measures by **NDMA and international bodies** emphasize the need for worker education, proper hydration, and medical facilities. Developing infrastructure and improving labour codes are essential for mitigating these impacts.

# Economic Growth and AI Deployment in Lower-Middle Income Economies

#### Economic Growth Forecast

The Economic Survey projects that the economy is expected to grow by **6.5% to 7% this year**. This positive outlook is driven by several factors including recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to increased economic activities globally and domestically. Various government initiatives aimed at boosting economic growth, infrastructure development, and **investments are contributing positively to this forecast**. Additionally, improved performance in the private sector, especially in manufacturing and services, supports these growth projections.

#### AI Deployment Concerns

Despite the optimistic growth forecast, there are significant concerns regarding the deployment of AI, particularly **capital-intensive and energy-intensive AI systems**, in a growing and lower-middle income economy. Deploying AI systems that require significant capital and energy investments might not be suitable for economies that are **still developing and have lower income levels**. These economies may need to prioritize more pressing needs such as infrastructure, education, and healthcare over expensive AI deployments. Furthermore, the **IT sector has seen slow hiring** over the past two years, indicating a cautious approach towards expanding the workforce. There is a concern that heavy investments in AI could lead to job displacement without significant job creation in other sectors.

#### Strategic Focus

It is essential for such economies to balance **their growth strategies**, ensuring that investments in technology do not overshadow fundamental economic needs. A balanced approach is necessary to ensure that technological advancements contribute to sustainable and inclusive economic growth. This involves careful resource allocation and strategic planning to avoid over-investment in areas that may not yield immediate benefits or may exacerbate existing economic disparities. Ensuring that AI and other technological investments align with the broader goals of sustainable development is crucial.

> The Economic Survey predicts a **6.5% to 7% growth in the economy** this year, highlighting recovery and positive government policies. However, there are concerns about deploying capital-intensive and energy-intensive AI in lower-middle income economies. The slow hiring in the IT sector over the past two years underscores the need for a balanced and sustainable approach to technology adoption that prioritizes economic suitability and resource allocation.
