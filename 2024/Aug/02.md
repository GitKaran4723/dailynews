# Is the Centre Being Iniquitous in State Transfers?

## Introduction
Recently, opposition Chief Ministers have boycotted and walked out of a NITI Aayog meeting chaired by the Prime Minister, alleging that the Centre is discriminating against non-NDA States. This has raised questions about the fairness and equity in the transfers of funds from the Centre to the States.

## Key Components of State Transfers

### Types of Transfers
- **Devolution of Taxes**: Constitutionally mandated sharing of central taxes with states based on Finance Commission (FC) recommendations.
- **Loans**: Borrowings provided to states, which must be repaid.
- **Finance Commission Grants**: Grants given based on FC's formula to address specific needs and ensure equity.
- **Non-Finance Commission Grants**: Discretionary grants given by the Centre, often criticized for lacking clear criteria.

### Issues with Discretionary Grants
- **Lack of Criteria**: Discretionary grants do not have a clear, transparent formula, leading to perceived arbitrariness.
- **Political Influence**: Critics argue that these grants are used to favor certain states, especially those aligned with the ruling party at the Centre.

## Reasons and Analysis

### Role of NITI Aayog
- **Replacement of Planning Commission**: The NITI Aayog replaced the Planning Commission, which previously played a significant role in regional development and acted as an intermediary between the Centre and States.
- **Limitations**: NITI Aayog lacks financial powers and enforcement authority, reducing its role to that of a think tank, which some argue diminishes its effectiveness in fostering cooperative federalism.

### Need for a New Institutional Framework
- **Professional and Transparent Engagement**: There is a call for a new, credible body that can facilitate professional and transparent discussions between the Centre and States, free from political influence.
- **Rule-Based Transfers**: All transfers, especially those outside FC recommendations, should be rule-based and free from discretionary practices to ensure fairness.

### Cesses and Surcharges
- **Increased Reliance**: The Centre has increasingly relied on cesses and surcharges, which are not shared with the States.
- **Impact on State Revenues**: This reliance has reduced the effective share of States in the overall tax revenue.
- **Recommendations**: Limiting the duration and number of cesses and surcharges, and increasing the States' share in devolution to 50% to compensate for the non-sharing of these revenues.

## Conclusion
The current system of state transfers has several areas that require reform to ensure fairness and equity. The Centre’s use of discretionary grants and increasing reliance on cesses and surcharges have raised concerns about the equitable distribution of resources. A new institutional framework that ensures rule-based, transparent, and politically neutral transfers is essential for fostering true cooperative federalism.

> Opposition Chief Ministers have accused the Centre of discrimination in state transfers, particularly through discretionary grants lacking clear criteria. The NITI Aayog, which replaced the Planning Commission, lacks financial powers, reducing its effectiveness. Critics call for a new body for transparent Centre-State discussions and rule-based transfers. The Centre's increased reliance on cesses and surcharges, not shared with States, further complicates the issue. Reforming these aspects is crucial for equitable resource distribution and cooperative federalism.

# States Can Sub-Classify SCs for Quotas: Supreme Court Ruling

## Introduction
In a landmark judgment, the Supreme Court of India ruled that states have the authority to sub-classify Scheduled Castes (SCs) listed in the Presidential List to provide preferential treatment in public employment and education. The judgment was delivered by a seven-judge Constitution Bench, led by Chief Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, with a 6:1 majority.

## Key Components of the Judgment

### Authority to Sub-Classify
- **Judgment**: States have the right to sub-classify SCs to ensure more equitable distribution of benefits.
- **Bench**: A seven-judge Constitution Bench with a 6:1 majority.

### Application of the Creamy Layer Principle
- **Recommendation**: Four judges suggested extending the creamy layer principle to SCs and Scheduled Tribes (STs), similar to the Other Backward Classes (OBC) category.
- **Objective**: Exclude affluent individuals or families from reservation benefits to prioritize the underprivileged within these classes.

## Reasons and Analysis

### Heterogeneity of Scheduled Castes
- **Diversity**: SCs consist of various tribes, castes, and groups, each with different socio-economic statuses.
- **Necessity**: Sub-classification is necessary to address the diverse needs and levels of deprivation within SCs, ensuring that the most disadvantaged receive the benefits.

### Equitable Distribution of Benefits
- **Targeted Assistance**: Sub-classification allows states to tailor reservation benefits more effectively, reaching those in greatest need.
- **Preventing Inequality**: By applying the creamy layer principle, the policy aims to prevent the more affluent among SCs and STs from monopolizing the benefits meant for the truly disadvantaged.

## Conclusion
The Supreme Court's decision empowers states to sub-classify SCs for more targeted and equitable distribution of reservation benefits in public employment and education. The suggestion to apply the creamy layer principle to SCs and STs underscores the need to ensure that the benefits of affirmative action reach the most underprivileged sections of society.
