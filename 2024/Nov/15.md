# AFSPA reimposed in six riot-hit areas of Manipur

**AFSPA**, or the **Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act**, is a law enacted to empower the Indian armed forces with special powers in regions identified as “disturbed areas” due to significant unrest, conflict, or violence. Below is a detailed explanation of AFSPA:

### 1. **Historical Background and Enactment**
- **Origin**: AFSPA was first introduced by the British colonial government to suppress the Quit India Movement in 1942. Post-independence, it was adopted by the Indian government to address internal security issues and insurgencies.
- **Legislative Framework**: The modern form of AFSPA was enacted in 1958 to counter the insurgency in the northeastern states. It was later extended to Jammu and Kashmir in 1990 due to rising militancy.
- **Implementation**: The act is imposed when an area is declared “disturbed” under **Section 3 of the AFSPA** by either the central or state government. This designation is based on threats to internal security, law, and order.

### 2. **Provisions of AFSPA**
- **Special Powers to Armed Forces**: The act grants extensive powers to the armed forces, including:
  - **Arrest Without Warrant**: Security personnel can arrest individuals without a warrant on the basis of reasonable suspicion.
  - **Search and Seizure**: The armed forces can search any premises and seize materials without needing prior permission or a warrant.
  - **Use of Force**: The act permits the use of force, including opening fire, to maintain public order if a person violates laws prohibiting assembly or carries weapons.
- **Immunity from Prosecution**: Under AFSPA, armed forces personnel have legal immunity from prosecution for actions taken under the act. Any legal proceedings require prior approval from the central government.

### 3. **Rationale for AFSPA**
- **Counter-Insurgency Operations**: AFSPA is intended to empower the military to conduct operations effectively in areas where insurgency, violence, or terrorism pose serious threats.
- **Maintaining Public Order**: The act helps ensure that armed forces can respond quickly to crises without bureaucratic delays that could hinder their effectiveness.

### 4. **Criticism and Concerns**
- **Human Rights Issues**: AFSPA has been heavily criticized for alleged human rights violations, including instances of excessive use of force, extrajudicial killings, and abuses of power.
- **Lack of Accountability**: The immunity provisions make it difficult to hold security personnel accountable for actions that violate human rights, fueling grievances among affected communities.
- **Prolonged Deployment**: Critics argue that AFSPA can lead to prolonged military presence in civilian areas, impacting daily life and civilian governance.
- **Judicial Scrutiny**: The Supreme Court of India and human rights organizations have called for better oversight and reforms to ensure that the act does not lead to misuse.

### 5. **Areas of Enforcement**
- **Northeastern States**: AFSPA has been primarily enforced in regions like **Manipur, Assam, Nagaland**, and **Arunachal Pradesh** due to longstanding insurgency issues.
- **Jammu and Kashmir**: The act was imposed in Jammu and Kashmir in 1990 in response to militant activities and continues to be a point of contention due to ongoing security challenges.
- **Recent Developments**: AFSPA is periodically reviewed and lifted in areas where the security situation improves. However, it has been reimposed or extended in places experiencing fresh violence or disturbances, such as parts of Manipur during riot-related crises.

### 6. **Recent Context: Manipur**
- **Reimposition in Manipur**: AFSPA has been reimposed in six areas of Manipur affected by riots to enable the military and paramilitary forces to restore law and order effectively. The state has seen communal and ethnic clashes that necessitated additional security measures for stabilization.
- **Implications**: The reimposition means that armed forces can exercise their powers under the act, including making arrests, conducting searches, and using force, while operating in these designated areas. This step is often met with mixed reactions, balancing the need for security with concerns over potential human rights issues.

### 7. **Debate and Future of AFSPA**
- **Reform Calls**: Activists, civil society organizations, and some political leaders continue to call for the repeal or amendment of AFSPA to include greater oversight, accountability, and a clearer focus on protecting human rights.
- **Government Stance**: The government maintains that AFSPA is crucial for maintaining national security and public order in volatile regions but has indicated a willingness to consider gradual withdrawal from areas where peace is restored.

### **Conclusion**
AFSPA is a significant yet controversial law designed to address security challenges in disturbed regions of India. While it enables armed forces to act swiftly to restore order and combat insurgency, its application raises critical concerns about human rights and the balance between security and civil liberties. The reimposition of AFSPA in parts of Manipur highlights the ongoing tension between maintaining internal security and ensuring the protection of fundamental rights. The act’s future will likely involve ongoing debate and potential reforms aimed at balancing these competing priorities.

> The **Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA)** grants the Indian military special powers in regions declared as “disturbed areas” to maintain public order. Enacted in 1958, it allows the armed forces to arrest without a warrant, search premises, and use force with immunity from prosecution. While intended to combat insurgency and ensure security, AFSPA has faced significant criticism for alleged human rights abuses and lack of accountability. Calls for reform or repeal cite its impact on civilian life and prolonged military presence. Recently, AFSPA was reimposed in six riot-hit areas of **Manipur** to address unrest, sparking renewed debate over its implications.

# RBI must cut rates to boost growth, look through food prices, says Goyal

When the **Reserve Bank of India (RBI)** cuts interest rates, it signals a strategic move aimed at stimulating economic growth. By lowering rates, the RBI makes borrowing cheaper for businesses and consumers, which in turn encourages spending and investment. This move can have significant implications for the economy, particularly during periods of sluggish growth or economic uncertainty.

### 1. **How Rate Cuts Work**
- **Monetary Policy and Growth**: The RBI’s primary tool for managing the economy is its monetary policy, which includes altering the **repo rate**—the rate at which the central bank lends money to commercial banks. A reduction in the repo rate lowers the cost of borrowing for commercial banks, which then pass on these benefits to businesses and consumers through lower interest rates on loans.
- **Boosting Consumer Spending**: Lower interest rates make consumer loans, such as mortgages, auto loans, and personal loans, more affordable. This encourages individuals to borrow more, thereby increasing their spending on goods and services. Higher consumer spending boosts demand, which helps drive production and, subsequently, economic growth.
- **Encouraging Business Investments**: When the cost of borrowing is lower, businesses find it more attractive to take loans for expanding operations, investing in new projects, or upgrading technology. This leads to increased production capacity and job creation, further stimulating economic activity.

### 2. **Looking Through Food Prices**
- **Volatile Nature of Food Prices**: Food prices are often subject to short-term fluctuations due to seasonal factors, supply chain disruptions, or global events like adverse weather conditions and geopolitical conflicts. Goyal’s call for the RBI to "look through" temporary spikes in food prices suggests that the central bank should focus on underlying, long-term inflation trends rather than transient price hikes.
- **Impact on Monetary Policy**: If the RBI reacts solely to temporary food price inflation by maintaining high interest rates, it risks stifling growth unnecessarily. By considering the broader economic context and not letting temporary food price inflation drive policy decisions, the RBI can prioritize measures that support sustained economic recovery.

### 3. **Benefits for Economic Growth**
- **Stimulus to the Real Estate Sector**: A rate cut can significantly benefit sectors like real estate and housing. Lower home loan interest rates can stimulate housing demand, which has a multiplier effect on related industries such as construction, cement, steel, and consumer goods.
- **Support for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs)**: Lower interest rates help SMEs, which are often more sensitive to borrowing costs than larger corporations. Easier access to affordable credit enables these businesses to expand, hire more workers, and contribute to economic growth.
- **Encouraging Private Consumption**: India's economy relies heavily on domestic consumption. Reduced borrowing costs can lead to increased household spending on durable goods, services, and discretionary items, which contributes to GDP growth.
- **Foreign Investment and Economic Sentiment**: Rate cuts can improve economic sentiment by signaling the RBI’s support for growth. This positive outlook can attract foreign investment as international investors see growth potential in India’s economy.

### 4. **Potential Risks and Considerations**
- **Inflationary Concerns**: One potential downside of rate cuts is the risk of fuelling inflation if demand outpaces supply. However, in a scenario where the economy is underperforming and there is slack in production capacity, this risk is mitigated.
- **Impact on Savings**: Lower interest rates can lead to reduced returns on savings accounts and fixed deposits, which may affect the income of those relying on interest earnings. This can temper the positive effects of increased consumption for some segments of the population.
- **Exchange Rate Dynamics**: Reduced interest rates could lead to a depreciation of the Indian Rupee, as lower returns on investments make Indian assets less attractive to foreign investors. While this could make imports more expensive, it may also benefit exports by making them more competitive globally.

### 5. **Balancing Growth and Inflation**
The RBI’s primary mandate is to ensure price stability while fostering economic growth. By cutting rates and choosing to “look through” temporary food price spikes, the RBI is betting that underlying inflation will remain controlled. This balance allows the central bank to focus on reviving growth without ignoring potential inflationary risks entirely.

### **Conclusion**
Goyal’s recommendation for the RBI to cut rates and look past short-term food price volatility is rooted in the need to stimulate growth in the face of economic challenges. Rate cuts can drive consumer spending and business investment, creating a ripple effect across various sectors and boosting economic growth. However, it is essential for the RBI to maintain vigilance over inflation trends and ensure that monetary policy adjustments are made with an eye on long-term stability. This balanced approach can help India achieve sustainable economic progress while managing the complexities of inflation and growth.

> Cutting interest rates by the **RBI** can stimulate economic growth by making borrowing cheaper, boosting consumer spending, and encouraging business investments. Goyal’s call for the RBI to overlook temporary spikes in food prices aims to focus on long-term inflation trends rather than short-term volatility. Lower rates can benefit sectors like real estate, support SMEs, and increase domestic consumption, contributing to GDP growth. However, risks include potential inflation, lower savings returns, and currency depreciation. By balancing growth and inflation, the RBI can drive economic recovery, enhance private sector activity, and foster sustainable development while managing inflationary pressures carefully.

# BASIC countries ask nations at COP29 to honour commitments for climate finance

At **COP29**, held in **Baku**, the **BASIC countries**—comprising **Brazil, South Africa, India, and China**—jointly urged developed nations to fulfill their commitments regarding **climate finance**. This call to action underscores the longstanding demand by developing nations for more substantial and consistent financial support to combat climate change. The BASIC countries, representing significant voices in the Global South, highlighted the imbalance between expectations placed on developing countries to pursue sustainable development and the lack of adequate support provided by wealthier nations to help them achieve these goals.

### 1. **Context and Background**
- **BASIC Group**: The BASIC countries have historically played an important role in climate negotiations as a coalition advocating for the interests of developing nations. Formed in 2009, this group has aimed to ensure that climate agreements are equitable and reflect the principle of **“common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities (CBDR-RC).”**
- **Climate Finance Commitments**: Developed nations have previously committed to providing $100 billion annually by 2020 to assist developing countries in mitigating and adapting to climate change. This pledge, made at **COP15 in Copenhagen in 2009**, has not been fully realized, causing frustration and mistrust among developing nations.

### 2. **Significance of Climate Finance**
- **Adaptation and Mitigation**: Developing countries often face severe impacts from climate change, including extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and economic disruptions. Climate finance is essential for building infrastructure, developing clean energy projects, and implementing resilience strategies to protect vulnerable communities.
- **Bridging Development Gaps**: For nations like those in the BASIC group, balancing economic growth with climate action is challenging. Financial assistance from wealthier countries can help bridge this gap, enabling the transition to sustainable practices without sacrificing development goals.

### 3. **Arguments Presented by BASIC Countries at COP29**
- **Honouring Pledges**: The BASIC countries emphasized that the failure of developed nations to meet their climate finance commitments undermines trust and hinders global cooperation. They called for a transparent roadmap for fulfilling the $100 billion annual target and scaling it up post-2025 to reflect the growing needs of developing countries.
- **Equity and Responsibility**: The BASIC bloc reiterated the importance of adhering to the **CBDR-RC** principle, stressing that developed countries, which have historically contributed the most to global greenhouse gas emissions, should shoulder a larger share of the financial burden.
- **Support Beyond Finance**: In addition to funding, the BASIC countries called for better support in terms of technology transfer and capacity building to help developing nations achieve their climate action targets effectively.

### 4. **Challenges and Concerns**
- **Inadequate Funding**: While there has been progress in mobilizing climate finance, actual contributions have often fallen short of commitments. Reports show that the $100 billion target remains unmet, leading to delays in crucial projects aimed at reducing emissions and adapting to climate impacts.
- **Complex Financial Flows**: Climate finance is often channelled through various bilateral and multilateral mechanisms, which can create complexities in tracking and deploying funds effectively. This can result in slow disbursement and limited impact on the ground.
- **Conditionalities**: Developing nations often express concerns about the conditions tied to climate finance, such as interest-bearing loans, which can increase the debt burden instead of providing genuine support.

### 5. **Strategic Importance for BASIC Countries**
- **Economic Growth and Sustainability**: Countries like India and China, which have rapidly growing economies, face significant challenges in aligning their development trajectories with climate goals. Adequate climate finance would enable them to invest in cleaner technologies and reduce carbon emissions without hindering growth.
- **Global Leadership in Climate Action**: The BASIC countries have positioned themselves as proactive participants in climate action, pushing for responsible climate policies that do not disproportionately affect developing economies. By calling out developed nations at COP29, they seek to reinforce their role as champions of equitable climate justice.
- **Strengthening Multilateralism**: BASIC’s collective voice at COP29 is a push towards reinforcing multilateral cooperation, ensuring that climate negotiations are more balanced and inclusive, considering the needs of the Global South.

### 6. **Expected Outcomes and Future Steps**
- **Reinforcement of Pledges**: The BASIC countries’ call at COP29 is likely to pressure developed nations to reassess their strategies and commitments to climate finance. This may lead to renewed efforts to meet the $100 billion target and discussions on raising the funding threshold post-2025.
- **Focus on Implementation**: Beyond securing commitments, BASIC countries will aim to streamline the processes through which funds are allocated and utilized, emphasizing transparency and ease of access.
- **Technology and Capacity Building**: Moving forward, these countries will push for better technology transfer arrangements and programs that build local expertise, empowering developing nations to manage climate projects independently.

### **Conclusion**
The BASIC countries' demand for honoring climate finance commitments at **COP29** reflects an urgent need for equitable and just climate action. Developed countries’ pledges to support developing nations have fallen short, hindering progress in global climate goals. Ensuring that these financial promises are met is essential for fostering trust and cooperation in international climate negotiations. The call from BASIC countries underscores the need for a stronger, more transparent, and inclusive approach to mobilizing and deploying climate finance, enabling developing countries to pursue sustainable development while addressing the pressing challenges of climate change.

> At **COP29**, the **BASIC countries**—Brazil, South Africa, India, and China—urged developed nations to fulfill their climate finance commitments. Highlighting the unmet $100 billion annual pledge from COP15, they stressed the importance of equitable support to help developing nations mitigate and adapt to climate change. The BASIC bloc emphasized the principle of **“common but differentiated responsibilities”**, calling for transparency, scaled-up funding post-2025, and better technology transfer. Their demand aims to build trust, enable sustainable development, and ensure fair climate action. This push reinforces the need for more inclusive, transparent climate finance to support global environmental and economic stability.

# How will SDS visa move hit students?

In a significant development, the Canadian government announced the discontinuation of the Student Direct Stream (SDS) visa in November 2024. This decision has far-reaching implications for Indian students, who have historically been one of the largest groups of international students in Canada. In 2022, India accounted for over 21% of all international students in Canada, with a staggering number of 222,450 Indian students choosing to study in Canadian institutions. Over 189,000 Indian students opted for the SDS visa that year, which significantly simplified their application process. For instance, while non-SDS applicants had an approval rate of 19%, SDS applicants enjoyed a 63% approval rate.

### What is the Canadian SDS visa?

The SDS visa, introduced in 2018, was a streamlined pathway designed to expedite the study permit application process for Indian students. It offered a faster processing time and reduced application fees, making it a popular choice among Indian students aspiring to pursue higher education in Canada. However, it also served students from other countries, including Antigua and Barbuda, Brazil, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Morocco, Pakistan, Peru, Philippines, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Senegal, Trinidad and Tobago, and Vietnam. The SDS visa was specifically tailored to offer several key benefits to international students.

One of the primary advantages was its significantly reduced processing time. By meeting specific eligibility criteria, such as a higher level of English language proficiency and a confirmed admission to a Designated Learning Institution (DLI), students could expect a quicker decision on their study permit application.

The SDS visa also offered a lower application fee than the standard study permit, which significantly reduced the financial burden for many international students.

It simplified the application process by requiring fewer supporting documents. By adhering to the specific eligibility requirements, students could submit a more streamlined application, making it easier to navigate the immigration process.

### Why was the SDS visa discontinued?

The Canadian government’s decision to discontinue the SDS visa program was driven by a combination of factors aimed at addressing various challenges and concerns within the immigration system.

On his X handle on September 19, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said, “We are granting 35% fewer international student permits this year. And next year, that number is going down by another 10%. Immigration is an advantage for our economy — but when bad actors abuse the system and take advantage of students, we crack down.” This refers to international applicants who applied for the SDS as an excuse to take a simple diploma course, hardly worth going abroad for, with their ultimate goal being to apply for permanent residency.

While the official reasons cited by the government focused on “strengthening program integrity, addressing student vulnerability, and giving all students equal and fair access to the application process,” several underlying factors likely contributed to this decision. Canada has been grappling with a significant housing shortage, particularly in major cities such as Toronto and Vancouver, and the rapid influx of international students, many of whom rely on off-campus housing, has exacerbated this issue. The increasing number of international students has also placed a strain on public services and infrastructure, including healthcare, education, and transportation.

The Canadian government may be reassessing its immigration policies to better manage the inflow of foreign students and ensure they contribute positively to the Canadian economy.

By discontinuing the SDS visa, the government aims to regulate the number of international students, alleviate pressure on housing and resources, and implement a more equitable approach to student visa processing.

### How does the discontinuation affect Indian students?

The discontinuation of the SDS visa has undoubtedly had an impact on Indian students seeking to pursue higher education in Canada and has introduced a host of challenges.

One of the most immediate consequences of the SDS visa’s discontinuation is the prolonged processing time for student visa applications. Before the SDS visa, the average processing time for student visas was significantly longer. With the removal of this expedited pathway, Indian students can expect to wait for a more extended period. This delay can disrupt academic plans and cause significant inconvenience.

Additionally, the discontinuation has led to increased application fees. While the exact fee structure may vary, it is generally higher for standard student visa applications than the SDS visa. This additional financial burden can be a considerable challenge, especially for students from lower-income backgrounds.

Furthermore, the application process for standard student visas is more complex and rigorous than the SDS visa. Students are required to submit a wider range of documents, including proof of funds, language proficiency test scores, and detailed study plans. The increased complexity can be overwhelming and time-consuming, potentially leading to errors and delays.

The direct impacts of the SDS visa’s discontinuation have far-reaching indirect consequences for Indian students. Potential delays in study plans can disrupt academic progress and career aspirations. Students may have to defer their admissions or explore alternative study destinations, which can impact their overall educational journey.

Moreover, this has created uncertainty about future immigration opportunities. The SDS visa was often seen as a stepping stone towards permanent residency in Canada. With this pathway no longer available, Indian students may face increased challenges in securing post-study work opportunities and ultimately immigrating to Canada.

Experts and stakeholders have expressed concerns about the discontinuation and its potential impact on Indian students. Immigration consultants and education advisors have highlighted the increased processing times, higher application fees, and stricter eligibility criteria associated with the regular student visa process.

Social media platforms have been abuzz with discussions, with many students expressing frustration and uncertainty about their study plans. One student, commenting on a popular education forum, lamented, “The SDS visa was a game-changer. It made the application process much smoother. Now, with its discontinuation, I’m worried about potential delays and increased costs.” While the Canadian government has cited concerns about program integrity and equitable access, critics argue that the decision may deter talented Indian students from choosing Canada as their study destination.

### What other options do Indian students have?

While the discontinuation of the SDS visa has presented challenges for Indian students, seeking to study in Canada, there are still viable alternative visa options available. The traditional student visa remains a primary pathway for international students, including Indians. By meeting the eligibility criteria, such as proof of funds, language proficiency, and a Letter of Acceptance from a DLI, students can apply for a student visa.

However, it is important to note that the standard student visa application process can be more time-consuming and requires a more comprehensive documentation package compared to the SDS visa. Additionally, students may face longer processing times and increased application fees.

To enhance their chances of visa approval, Indian students should carefully plan their applications, submit all required documents on time, and consider consulting with immigration experts to navigate the complexities of the process.

The longer processing times, higher fees, and more complex application procedures have created significant hurdles. The indirect consequences, such as delayed study plans, increased financial burden, and uncertainty about future immigration opportunities further compound the challenges faced by Indian students.

For Indian students considering studying in Canada, it is crucial to plan ahead and prepare thoroughly. Early application is key, as it allows ample time for processing and addressing any potential issues. Thorough documentation is essential to meet the stringent requirements of the regular student visa process.

While the discontinuation of the SDS visa has presented challenges, it is important to remain hopeful for future changes or the introduction of alternative streamlined pathways for international students.

As the Canadian government continues to evolve its immigration policies, new opportunities may arise for Indian students. By staying informed and taking proactive steps, Indian students can navigate the complexities of the Canadian immigration system and achieve their academic and career goals.

> Changes to the **Student Direct Stream (SDS) visa** program could significantly impact students seeking education abroad, particularly those from countries like India. The SDS program, known for its faster processing time for study permits, has become more restrictive, potentially tightening eligibility criteria or increasing documentation requirements. This could delay or limit the number of students able to study in countries like Canada, which has been a popular destination. Students may face longer processing times, increased financial scrutiny, and higher overall costs. Such changes can affect students’ academic plans, career prospects, and financial commitments, adding pressure to their application process.
