# Should packaged food content be labelled?

A new report published by **Access to Nutrition Initiative (ATNi)** a non-profit global foundation, has found that leading food and beverage (F&B) companies, on average, sell products that are less healthy in low-and-middle income countries (LMICs) compared to what they sell in high-income countries (HICs). This report, which is the fifth edition of the **‘Global Access to Nutrition Index’**, states that it assessed 30 of the world’s largest F&B manufacturers — 23% of the global F&B market — on their performance to improve access to nutritious foods.

### What were the report’s findings?

The report analysed 52,414 products — including those from popular brands such as Nestle, Pepsico, Unilever, Coca-Cola and Hershey among others — using a health star rating system.

Under this system products are ranked out of 5 on their healthiness, with 5 being the best, and a score above 3.5 considered to be a healthier choice. The system assesses components of food considered to increase risk (energy, saturated fat, total sugars and sodium) and offsets these against components considered to decrease risk (protein, fibre and fruit, vegetable, nut and legume) to calculate a final score that is converted to a star rating. The ATNi report found that ‘portfolio healthiness’ was found to be lowest in LMICs, highlighting disparities in products offered across different markets. Food product healthiness in LMICs scored much lower — 1.8 on the system — than in HICs where it scored 2.3. Only 30% of companies have demonstrated a strategy to price some of their ‘healthier’ products affordably for lower income consumers, the report found. It also found that in LMICs, micronutrient data were available for a smaller proportion of products as compared to those in HICs.

### Is this the first time?

This is not the first instance of such a finding: in April this year, a report by Swiss NGO, Public Eye and the global coalition International Baby Food Action Network (IBFAN), found that Nestle’s baby food products sold in India as well as in African and Latin American countries, had higher sugar content compared to the same products sold in European markets. While Nestle denied this, the Central government asked the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) to initiate “appropriate action” against Nestle.

### Why is this of significance in India?

India is staring at a Non-Communicable Disease (NCD) burden of epic proportions — an estimated 10.13 crore Indians have diabetes, and as per National Family Health Survey 5 data, obesity stands at 24% among women and 23% among men. At the same time, undernutrition, anaemia and micronutrient deficiencies continue to remain pressing problems.

A large chunk of the NCD burden, experts say, has to do with diets changing over the past few decades and becoming unhealthier. Citing the Indian Council of Medical Research’s (ICMR) dietary guidelines, published in April this year, the Economic Survey of India 2023-24 noted that 56.4% of the total disease burden in India is due to unhealthy diets. The ICMR report had said the upsurge in the consumption of highly processed foods, laden with sugars and fat, coupled with reduced physical activity and limited access to diverse foods, exacerbate micronutrient deficiencies and overweight/obesity problems.

Another significant issue here is affordability: as per UN data over 50% of Indians cannot afford a healthy diet. At the same time, Indian government data reveals that households’ expenditure on processed food as a proportion of their food expenditure has risen, says development economist Dipa Sinha.

### What about food package labelling?

India is a party to the World Health Assembly (WHA) resolutions, one of which is a resolution on marketing of foods and non-alcoholic beverages to children, highlighting the need to protect children from harmful marketing of junk foods. In 2017, India launched the National Multisectoral Action Plan for Prevention and Control of Common NCDs, 2017-22 (NMAP). However, there has been very little progress made to address front-of-pack labelling of food.

Activists have, for years, been pushing the government to bring in regulations for front-of-package labelling of foods that would indicate high sugar, fat and sodium content. A draft notification: Food Safety and Standards (Labelling & Display) Amendment Regulation 2022 was brought in, but has made no headway in two years, says Arun Gupta, convener, Nutrition Advocacy for Public Interest (NAPi). Studies have shown, Dr. Gupta points out, that labelling on the front of packaged food is effective: in Chile and Mexico for instance, the consumption of sugary beverages decreased after such mandatory labelling.

An analysis by NAPi of 43 advertisements of pre-packaged food products and their composition revealed that these foods were high in one or more nutrients of concern such as saturated fat etc. “Policymakers and governments should introduce mandatory policies. To date, voluntary efforts by companies have been insufficient to ensure widespread and strong nutrition-related performance,” the ATNi report states.

# GM crops can help fight hunger depending on farming method

### GM Crops and Their Role in Combating Hunger: The Importance of Farming Methods

Genetically modified (GM) crops have the potential to significantly address global hunger, provided they are cultivated using appropriate and sustainable farming methods. With a growing global population and increasing pressure on agricultural systems due to climate change, GM crops offer innovative solutions. However, their success in combating hunger depends on how they are integrated into farming practices.

---

#### **Benefits of GM Crops in Fighting Hunger**

1. **Increased Yield**:
   - GM crops are engineered to produce higher yields compared to conventional varieties. This can help farmers grow more food on the same amount of land, addressing food shortages in densely populated regions.

2. **Pest and Disease Resistance**:
   - Crops like Bt cotton and Bt brinjal are modified to resist pests, reducing crop losses and the need for chemical pesticides. This makes farming more efficient and cost-effective, especially for smallholders.

3. **Drought and Climate Resilience**:
   - Climate change has increased the frequency of droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events. GM crops like drought-resistant maize and flood-tolerant rice varieties are designed to thrive under such challenging conditions, ensuring stable food production.

4. **Enhanced Nutrition**:
   - Biofortified GM crops, such as Golden Rice enriched with Vitamin A, address malnutrition by providing essential nutrients. This is particularly crucial for vulnerable populations in developing countries.

5. **Economic Benefits**:
   - By reducing input costs (e.g., fertilizers, pesticides) and increasing productivity, GM crops can boost the incomes of small and marginal farmers, making food systems more equitable.

---

#### **Challenges and the Role of Farming Methods**

While GM crops offer numerous benefits, their impact on fighting hunger depends largely on how they are cultivated and integrated into broader agricultural systems.

1. **Monoculture Risks**:
   - Relying heavily on GM monocultures can deplete soil health, reduce biodiversity, and increase vulnerability to pests and diseases over time. Sustainable farming practices, such as crop rotation and intercropping, must complement GM technology to maintain ecosystem balance.

2. **Accessibility for Small Farmers**:
   - High costs of GM seeds and dependence on proprietary technologies can exclude smallholder farmers, especially in developing countries. Policies should ensure affordable access to GM technology and protect farmers’ rights to save and exchange seeds.

3. **Sustainability Concerns**:
   - Excessive use of herbicide-resistant GM crops can lead to overuse of chemicals, creating “superweeds” and harming the environment. Integrated pest management (IPM) and judicious use of agrochemicals are critical for sustainable cultivation.

4. **Local Adaptation**:
   - GM crop varieties must be adapted to local conditions and cultural practices. Collaboration with local farmers and researchers is essential to ensure compatibility with diverse agricultural ecosystems.

5. **Public Perception and Regulation**:
   - Misinformation and lack of trust in GM crops often hinder their adoption. Transparent regulatory frameworks, public awareness campaigns, and stakeholder engagement can build confidence in the safety and benefits of GM technology.

---

#### **Way Forward**

- **Integrated Farming Systems**: Combining GM crops with agroecological practices can enhance productivity while preserving environmental health.
- **Targeted Interventions**: Focus on crops and regions where GM technology can have the greatest impact, such as drought-prone or nutrient-deficient areas.
- **Government Support**: Policies should promote research, subsidize seeds for smallholders, and support sustainable farming practices.

---

#### **Conclusion**

GM crops are a powerful tool in the fight against hunger, but their success depends on their integration into sustainable farming systems. By adopting responsible practices and ensuring equitable access, GM technology can help build resilient agricultural systems and secure food for future generations.

> Genetically modified (GM) crops can play a key role in combating hunger by increasing yields, enhancing pest and drought resistance, and improving nutritional content, such as Golden Rice enriched with Vitamin A. However, their success relies on sustainable farming practices. Challenges like monoculture risks, high seed costs, overuse of chemicals, and public skepticism must be addressed. Integrating GM crops with practices like crop rotation, targeted interventions in vulnerable regions, and ensuring accessibility for small farmers is crucial. Government support and transparent policies are essential to build trust and promote equitable use. Properly managed, GM crops can ensure food security and resilience.

# urban centres such as Mumbai and Thane recorded a low turnout 

### Why Urban Centres Like Mumbai and Bangalore Show Low Voter Turnout in Elections

Urban areas often experience lower voter turnout compared to rural counterparts, a trend observed in cities like Mumbai and Bangalore. While urban residents generally have better access to information, infrastructure, and voting facilities, their participation in elections remains relatively low. The reasons for this phenomenon are multifaceted, involving social, logistical, and psychological factors.

---

### **Reasons for Low Voter Turnout in Urban Areas**

#### 1. **High Mobility and Migration**
   - Urban populations are highly mobile, with many individuals moving frequently for jobs, education, or better living conditions. Migrants often remain registered in their hometowns and are unable to vote in their current city of residence.
   - Temporary residents or tenants may feel disconnected from local political issues, reducing their motivation to vote.

#### 2. **Disillusionment with Governance**
   - Urban voters often express dissatisfaction with the political system, perceiving politicians as ineffective or corrupt.
   - This cynicism leads to voter apathy, as they feel their vote will not bring meaningful change.

#### 3. **Busy Lifestyles**
   - Urban dwellers often have demanding work schedules and may not prioritize voting due to time constraints.
   - Election day, even if declared a holiday, might be viewed as an opportunity for leisure or personal tasks rather than civic participation.

#### 4. **Complex Social Dynamics**
   - Urban populations are diverse, with individuals from varied cultural, linguistic, and economic backgrounds. This heterogeneity can dilute a sense of community and shared political identity, leading to weaker collective voting motivation.
   - Issues in urban centers are often perceived as too broad or complicated to be effectively addressed by voting.

#### 5. **Lack of Awareness and Connection**
   - Many urban residents feel disconnected from local issues, especially in cities where they live primarily for work or education.
   - Urban voters may lack awareness of candidates or their policies, as urban campaigns are less personal compared to grassroots-level campaigning in rural areas.

#### 6. **Ease of Access to Alternatives**
   - Urban residents often enjoy relatively better services and infrastructure, such as water, electricity, and healthcare, which can lead to complacency. They may not see elections as critical for their day-to-day lives.
   - Contrast this with rural areas, where elections are often viewed as a means to secure basic necessities.

#### 7. **Logistical Challenges**
   - Despite better infrastructure, long travel times within cities, traffic congestion, and distant polling stations can deter voters.
   - Some urban residents, especially in slum areas, may face issues related to voter registration or lack of updated voter IDs.

#### 8. **Role of Private Sector Jobs**
   - Unlike government offices, private employers may not provide time off for voting. Many urban workers in private jobs find it challenging to participate in elections during working hours.

---

### **Addressing Urban Voter Apathy**

1. **Ease Voter Registration**:
   - Simplify voter registration processes and introduce targeted initiatives for migrants and urban professionals to update their voter details.
   
2. **Awareness Campaigns**:
   - Conduct targeted campaigns in urban areas, emphasizing the importance of voting and how it impacts urban governance.

3. **Convenience Voting Options**:
   - Introduce early voting, postal ballots, or electronic voting systems to make voting more accessible.

4. **Incentivize Participation**:
   - Collaborate with private companies to declare election days as paid holidays and encourage voter participation.

5. **Localized Campaigning**:
   - Focus on hyper-local issues in urban areas to create a stronger connection between voters and candidates.

---

### **Conclusion**
The low voter turnout in cities like Mumbai and Bangalore stems from a combination of logistical challenges, disconnection from local governance, and lifestyle factors. Addressing these issues requires a combination of voter education, simplified processes, and efforts to make elections more accessible and relevant to urban voters. Enhanced participation from urban areas is essential to strengthen democratic governance in rapidly growing cities.

> Urban centers like Mumbai and Bangalore often witness low voter turnout due to factors such as high mobility, voter apathy, busy lifestyles, and a sense of disconnection from local issues. Urban residents, especially migrants, may not update their voter registrations, while others feel elections won't bring significant change. Logistical challenges, long commutes, and private-sector work schedules further hinder participation. Additionally, urban diversity dilutes collective political identity, and better infrastructure leads to complacency. Addressing this requires simplified voter registration, awareness campaigns, localized issue focus, convenience voting options, and collaboration with private employers to encourage civic participation and improve urban voter turnout.
