# What has SC ruled on bulldozing property?

The Supreme Court on November 13 underscored that it is unconstitutional to demolish a person’s property without adhering to the due process of law, simply on the grounds of their alleged involvement in a crime. A Bench of Justices B.R. Gavai and K.V. Viswanathan issued a slew of guidelines to prevent illegal and retributive bulldozing of homes and private properties of accused persons by States. Earlier, the top court had extended its interim order halting demolitions across the country without express permission except for encroachments on public land or unauthorised structures.

### Has there been a marked increase in demolitions?

Over the last few years, there has been an advent of bulldozing of homes and private properties of accused persons in several States. Demolitions were justified on account of action against encroachment or under the pretext of unauthorised construction.

What began with the bulldozer demolitions in Delhi’s Jahangirpuri following communal violence spread to other parts of the country. The violence that ensued in Nuh, Haryana, due to a clash between two religious groups in 2023, ended with the local administration demolishing a large number of homes in the neighbourhood. Similarly, communal riots in Khargone, Madhya Pradesh, led to the demolition of houses and businesses owned by Muslims, who were deemed to be “alleged rioters.”

According to a 2024 estimate by the Housing and Land Rights Network, authorities at the local, State, and central levels demolished 153,820 homes in 2022 and 2023, displacing over 738,438 individuals across rural and urban areas of the country. Additionally, a report published in February by Amnesty International revealed that authorities in four BJP-ruled States and one AAP-governed State demolished 128 structures — primarily belonging to Muslims — between April and June 2022.

The court’s verdict was delivered in response to a batch of petitions challenging demolition drives conducted by several States. These petitions were clubbed with another petition filed by Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind challenging the demolitions carried out in Jahangirpuri in 2022. On September 2, the two-judge Bench conveyed the intention to frame binding pan-India guidelines to address the petitioners’ concerns by invoking its powers under Article 142.

### What did the court rule?

At the outset, the court asserted that constitutional ethos strictly prohibits the demolition of properties belonging to individuals, whether accused or convicted, without due process of law. It further underscored that such exercise of arbitrariness by government officials strikes at the very heart of the “rule of law” and undermines public trust. Cautioning against the executive usurping the judiciary’s role by preemptively punishing the accused, Justice Gavai observed, “The executive cannot become a judge and decide that a person accused is guilty and, therefore, punish him by demolishing his residential/commercial property/properties. Such an act of the executive would be transgressing its limits.”

Notably, the judges acknowledged that demolition drives not only target the alleged perpetrators of an offence but also impose a form of “collective punishment” on their families. Justice Gavai pointed out that this offends the constitutional guarantee of the right to shelter under Article 21. “If his spouse, children, parents live in the same house or co-own the same property, can they be penalised by demolishing the property without them even being involved in any crime only on the basis of them being related to an alleged accused person? As is well known, a pious father may have a recalcitrant son and vice versa,” he observed. Justice Gavai also observed that if a particular property is singled out for demolition while other similar structures in the vicinity remain untouched, it raises a strong inference of mala fide intent on the part of the State. Without mincing words, he stressed that the “true motive” behind such actions appeared to be a deliberate attempt to punish the accused without affording them the opportunity for a fair trial in a court of law.

### What are the guidelines?

The court issued comprehensive guidelines aimed at fostering greater institutional accountability. However, it clarified that these directives would not apply to unauthorised constructions or demolitions mandated by a court. The judges specified that officials responsible for illegal demolitions would face disciplinary action, contempt charges, and monetary penalties. Moreover, it directed that compensation for wrongful demolitions be directly recovered from such erring officials.

Recognising the need to provide affected parties with adequate time to arrange alternative housing and challenge the demolition order, the court mandated that no demolition drive should proceed without a 15-day prior notice. Such notice should be served on the house owner by registered post and must provide details of the nature of the unauthorised construction, details of specific violations, and grounds warranting such a coercive action.

Further, the designated authority has been ordered to extend an opportunity of personal hearing to the owner. The minutes of such a meeting are directed to be duly recorded with the final order detailing the contentions of the parties including whether the unauthorised construction is compoundable, or whether there is a need to undertake demolition of the entire structure. Additionally, the concerned authority must prepare a detailed inspection report, signed by at least two witnesses, before proceeding with the demolition drive.

The judges also directed the authorities to ensure that the entire demolition process is thoroughly videographed. A detailed demolition report must be prepared, specifying the names of the police officials and personnel involved. The report should be placed before the Municipal Commissioner and uploaded on a digital portal to ensure public accessibility.

> The Supreme Court of India has ruled that demolishing properties of individuals accused or convicted of crimes without following due legal process is unconstitutional. Such actions amount to "collective punishment" and violate fundamental rights. The Court emphasized that state authorities cannot act arbitrarily and must adhere to the rule of law. It issued guidelines mandating prior notice before demolitions and recommended video recording the process to ensure transparency. This ruling aims to curb the practice of "bulldozer justice," where properties are demolished as punitive measures without legal proceedings.

# 35% doctors in India feel unsafe while at work, study shows

The recent tragic incident at a **government hospital in Chennai** on **November 13, 2024**, where a doctor was repeatedly stabbed while performing his duties, has once again highlighted the alarming issue of **workplace violence against healthcare professionals** in India. This comes just three months after the brutal rape and murder of a young doctor in **Kolkata**, underscoring a pervasive and troubling pattern of violence directed at medical personnel.

### The Growing Threat of Violence
Workplace violence in healthcare settings is not a new phenomenon in India, but its frequency and severity have been increasing over the years. A **2017 study** by the **Indian Medical Association (IMA)** revealed that over **75% of doctors** across India had faced some form of workplace violence, while **63%** reported an inability to see patients without fearing potential violence. Another study indicated that nearly **70%** of doctors encountered violence during their work, ranging from verbal abuse to physical confrontations.

**Verbal abuse**, threats, and intimidation are common, but incidents of severe physical assault, as seen in recent cases, are becoming alarmingly more frequent. The reasons for such violence vary and can include patient dissatisfaction, delays in treatment, deaths during treatment, or misunderstandings regarding medical procedures. Often, bystanders and patient families express frustration through aggression towards healthcare professionals who are already working under stressful conditions.

### Contributing Factors
Several factors contribute to this growing problem:
- **Overburdened Healthcare System**: Public healthcare facilities in India are frequently overcrowded and under-resourced, leading to long waiting times and overworked staff. Patients and their families, frustrated by delays and lack of adequate communication, sometimes resort to violence out of desperation.
- **High Patient-to-Doctor Ratio**: The shortage of medical professionals, especially in government hospitals, exacerbates the stress on doctors. This not only leads to burnout among healthcare workers but also affects the quality of patient care, heightening tensions.
- **Lack of Security**: Many healthcare facilities do not have sufficient security measures in place to prevent or manage violent situations. The absence of trained personnel or systems to handle crises leaves doctors and hospital staff vulnerable.
- **Inadequate Legal Frameworks**: While some states in India have implemented laws to protect medical personnel, enforcement is often weak, and there is no nationwide, stringent legal structure that effectively deters such violence.

### Consequences for Healthcare Professionals
The impact of violence on healthcare professionals is profound. Physically, they risk injuries that could incapacitate them. Psychologically, repeated exposure to violence can lead to anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The fear of violence affects doctors’ ability to provide care confidently and can lead to defensive medical practices, where doctors avoid certain high-risk procedures or work environments to safeguard themselves.

Additionally, this pervasive threat contributes to a demoralizing work atmosphere, impacting retention rates and leading to a shortage of experienced healthcare professionals. The continuous risk of violence discourages new graduates from joining the public healthcare system, exacerbating the workforce crisis in an already strained sector.

### Need for Comprehensive Solutions
To address this issue effectively, a multi-pronged approach is necessary:
- **Strengthening Legislation**: The implementation of a robust, nationwide law to protect healthcare workers from violence is critical. Such legislation should include stringent penalties for perpetrators and ensure timely legal action.
- **Enhanced Security Measures**: Hospitals must invest in better security infrastructure, including surveillance cameras, alarm systems, and trained security personnel to manage violent situations.
- **Public Awareness Campaigns**: Educating the public about the challenges faced by healthcare professionals and fostering empathy through awareness campaigns can help reduce the incidence of violence.
- **Training for Healthcare Staff**: Doctors and hospital staff should receive training on conflict resolution and communication skills to de-escalate potentially violent situations.
- **Better Healthcare Policies**: Improving the doctor-to-patient ratio, reducing wait times, and ensuring that hospitals are well-resourced can prevent the frustration that often leads to violence.

### Conclusion
The incidents in **Chennai** and **Kolkata** are tragic reminders of the persistent danger faced by healthcare professionals in India. Workplace violence is not just a threat to the safety of medical staff but also impacts the quality of healthcare delivery and the overall trust between patients and providers. Addressing this issue requires a concerted effort involving stricter laws, better security, public education, and systemic improvements to the healthcare infrastructure. Protecting those who dedicate their lives to saving others is essential for ensuring a safe, effective, and resilient healthcare system.

> Workplace violence against healthcare professionals in India is an escalating issue, highlighted by the recent stabbing of a doctor in Chennai and the rape-murder of a young doctor in Kolkata. Studies show that over **75%** of doctors have experienced workplace violence, which includes verbal abuse and physical assaults, but only a fraction of incidents are reported. Contributing factors include an overburdened healthcare system, high patient-to-doctor ratios, lack of security, and inadequate legal protections. This violence leads to physical harm, mental stress, and reduced confidence among doctors. Solutions include stronger legislation, better hospital security, public awareness, and improved healthcare infrastructure and policies.

# Electronically track undertrials to cut crowding of jails: SC body

The Indian prison system is currently grappling with significant challenges, with **overcrowding** being one of the most critical issues. Overcrowded prisons lead to poor living conditions, increased stress on resources, limited rehabilitation opportunities, and heightened chances of violence and recidivism. A recent report by the **Supreme Court’s Centre for Research and Planning**, titled “**Prisons in India — mapping prison manuals and measures for reformation and decongestion**,” addresses these challenges and proposes innovative solutions to alleviate the pressure on the system. The report, released by **President Droupadi Murmu** on November 5, highlights the potential of using **electronic tracking devices** as a method for managing undertrial prisoners (UTPs) and easing overcrowding.

### Overview of the Report's Proposal
The report advocates for the launch of **pilot programmes** that utilize electronic monitoring devices for undertrial prisoners who are low to moderate risk and have demonstrated good conduct. The goal is to release such prisoners on parole or furlough while ensuring that they remain under supervision through electronic tracking. This approach is intended to:
- **Reduce overcrowding** in prisons by allowing suitable UTPs to serve their time in controlled freedom outside the prison system.
- **Enhance offender management** by maintaining a level of supervision that helps prevent potential absconding or violations.
- **Assess community readiness** for the broader adoption of electronic monitoring as part of India’s correctional strategy.

### Why Electronic Monitoring?
**Electronic monitoring devices**, such as ankle bracelets or GPS-enabled trackers, are used in many countries as an effective alternative to incarceration. They provide a means of tracking the movements of individuals released from custody to ensure compliance with the terms of their release. This method has proven to be a useful tool in balancing public safety with the need to alleviate prison congestion.

**Benefits of electronic monitoring include**:
- **Reduced prison population**: By allowing prisoners to be monitored outside, the strain on overcrowded facilities is reduced.
- **Lower costs**: Monitoring devices are generally more cost-effective than maintaining an individual in prison.
- **Rehabilitation support**: Prisoners under electronic supervision can engage in activities like employment, education, and community service, aiding their reintegration into society.

### Pilot Programme Strategy
The report suggests that the **pilot run** should initially focus on undertrial prisoners who meet specific criteria:
- **Low to moderate risk**: These are prisoners who do not pose a significant threat to public safety.
- **Good conduct**: Prisoners who have maintained good behavior during their incarceration.
- **Short-term release**: Monitoring may be conducted when UTPs are out on parole or furlough.

This limited pilot phase would allow authorities to evaluate the effectiveness of electronic monitoring, identify challenges, and determine the feasibility of extending this practice to a broader range of prisoners.

### Potential Challenges
While the benefits of electronic monitoring are evident, there are also challenges that must be addressed for the successful implementation of this programme:
- **Technological infrastructure**: Ensuring that the technology used is reliable and secure is crucial for maintaining public confidence and preventing tampering or failures.
- **Legal framework**: Current laws may need amendments to include provisions for electronic monitoring as a condition for parole or furlough.
- **Privacy concerns**: Balancing surveillance with respect for the individuals' privacy and civil rights is an important consideration.
- **Resource allocation**: Training personnel to manage and monitor electronic tracking systems, and ensuring coordination between law enforcement and the prison system, will require resources and planning.

### Implementation and Future Outlook
If the pilot proves successful, the programme could be expanded to include a wider range of prisoners, potentially extending to those serving short-term sentences or individuals who have demonstrated significant rehabilitation. The broader adoption of electronic monitoring could play a crucial role in reforming India’s prison system by making it more efficient and humane.

Moreover, this approach aligns with global trends in prison reform, where the emphasis is shifting from punitive measures to corrective and rehabilitative practices. Countries such as the **United States, United Kingdom, and several European nations** have successfully used electronic monitoring to manage non-violent offenders, reduce prison populations, and lower the costs associated with incarceration.

### Conclusion
The Supreme Court’s report highlights an innovative approach to addressing one of the most pressing challenges facing India’s prison system — overcrowding. By introducing **electronic monitoring** for low to moderate risk undertrial prisoners, India could see a more balanced approach to offender management that maintains public safety while alleviating the strain on prisons. Successful implementation would require careful planning, resource allocation, and public education to ensure acceptance and effectiveness. This reform could mark a significant step towards modernizing India’s correctional system and fostering a focus on rehabilitation and community reintegration.

# Karnataka aims to create 10,000 new start-ups outside the city in five years: Priyank

**Regionalism** and **backwardness** are significant factors that affect the development landscape in **Karnataka**, a state known for its strong IT sector centered in Bengaluru. Despite Bengaluru’s reputation as a global technology and innovation hub, much of the state remains underdeveloped in comparison, facing socio-economic and infrastructural challenges. The state’s **Beyond Bengaluru** initiative, as emphasized by **Priyank Kharge**, the Minister for Information Technology, aims to address these disparities by fostering entrepreneurship and creating 10,000 new start-ups in smaller towns and cities over the next five years. Understanding how regionalism and backwardness impact Karnataka is essential for assessing the state’s growth potential and development strategies.

### 1. **Disparities Between Urban and Rural Areas**
Karnataka’s economic and technological growth is heavily concentrated in **Bengaluru**, which accounts for a large share of the state’s GDP. However, this growth has not been uniformly spread across the state, leading to significant **urban-rural disparities**. Cities like **Mysuru, Mangaluru, and Hubballi-Dharwad** have experienced some growth, but smaller towns and rural areas often lack the infrastructure, investment, and opportunities needed for significant development.

**Backwardness** in these regions is characterized by:
- **Limited Access to Technology**: Smaller towns and rural areas face challenges in terms of technological infrastructure, including reliable internet connectivity and digital literacy.
- **Poor Infrastructure**: Basic facilities such as roads, public transport, and power supply are inadequate, limiting the capacity for industrial and business growth.
- **Educational Gaps**: A lack of high-quality educational institutions and skill development programs outside Bengaluru reduces the talent pool available for new businesses and tech initiatives.
- **Healthcare and Social Services**: Underdeveloped social infrastructure impacts the quality of life and discourages potential entrepreneurs from setting up businesses in less urbanized regions.

### 2. **Impact of Regionalism**
**Regionalism** plays a significant role in shaping the socio-political landscape of Karnataka. Different regions, such as **Old Mysore, Coastal Karnataka, Hyderabad-Karnataka (Kalyana-Karnataka), and Mumbai-Karnataka**, have distinct historical, cultural, and economic characteristics. This regional diversity often leads to uneven development due to political prioritization and resource allocation.

**Challenges posed by regionalism include**:
- **Political Prioritization**: Certain regions may receive more attention and funding based on political influence or voting patterns. This can result in resource allocation disparities, leaving backward regions underfunded.
- **Inter-regional Rivalries**: Competition for state resources among regions can impede cooperative development efforts. For example, the **Kalyana-Karnataka** region, which historically faces backwardness, may struggle to compete for resources with more economically active areas.
- **Cultural Differences**: Linguistic and cultural diversity can create barriers to uniform policy implementation, as strategies that work in one region may not be as effective in another.

### 3. **Economic and Social Impact of Backwardness**
**Backward regions** in Karnataka often struggle with higher poverty rates, unemployment, and underemployment. The lack of economic diversification in these areas means they rely heavily on agriculture and traditional industries, which are susceptible to market fluctuations and environmental challenges. This backwardness creates a cycle of limited opportunity and low income, making it difficult for residents to participate in the economic growth that more developed regions enjoy.

### 4. **The Beyond Bengaluru Initiative**
The **Beyond Bengaluru** initiative aims to mitigate regional disparities by promoting entrepreneurship and technological growth outside the capital. This plan seeks to leverage Karnataka’s potential by:
- **Encouraging Start-up Ecosystems**: Providing incentives, funding, and infrastructure support to start-ups in smaller cities and towns.
- **Skill Development Programs**: Enhancing local education and training to create a skilled workforce capable of supporting new industries.
- **Improving Infrastructure**: Investing in transport, energy, and digital connectivity to make smaller towns attractive for business and investment.
- **Collaboration with Stakeholders**: Partnering with private enterprises, educational institutions, and non-profit organizations to create a conducive environment for start-ups.

### 5. **Overcoming Regional Challenges**
To successfully implement such initiatives, the government must address regional disparities by:
- **Ensuring Equitable Resource Allocation**: Funding should be distributed fairly to prioritize the development of backward regions.
- **Localized Policies**: Customizing policies that cater to the unique needs and strengths of each region.
- **Building Awareness and Engagement**: Promoting awareness about entrepreneurship opportunities in smaller towns and engaging local communities to support start-up culture.

### **Conclusion**
**Regionalism and backwardness** present significant challenges to Karnataka’s overall growth, but targeted initiatives like **Beyond Bengaluru** aim to bridge these gaps. By fostering entrepreneurship, improving infrastructure, and developing local talent in smaller towns and cities, Karnataka can create a more balanced and inclusive economic landscape. Addressing these issues requires concerted efforts from the government, private sector, and local communities to ensure that growth reaches every corner of the state, making it a robust and equitable development model for others to follow.

> Karnataka's development is marked by significant disparities between the tech-driven growth of **Bengaluru** and the **backwardness** of smaller towns and rural areas, which face limited infrastructure, poor educational resources, and inadequate access to technology. **Regionalism** exacerbates these issues, as different areas with unique historical and cultural identities often compete for resources and political attention, leading to uneven development. The **Beyond Bengaluru** initiative, led by IT Minister **Priyank Kharge**, aims to create 10,000 start-ups in smaller towns over five years to address these imbalances. The plan focuses on boosting local entrepreneurship, improving infrastructure, and fostering skill development for more inclusive growth.

# ‘More hours and less wages, a reality of platform workers’

The rapid growth of gig and platform-based work has become a defining feature of labor markets worldwide, including India. Platforms like food delivery services, taxi aggregators, and hyperlocal service providers have seen a surge in workers relying on them for income. However, while more workers may be engaged in this sector, the nature of their compensation and working conditions raises significant concerns.

### Insights from Fairwork’s Findings
**Balaji Parthasarathy**, Principal Investigator for the Fairwork project in India and a professor at **IIIT-Bangalore**, presented findings highlighting these concerns. Speaking at a seminar by the **Centre for Labour Studies, NLSIU**, he shed light on the precarious nature of gig work in India. The project tracked data from 1,318 platform workers over four years, finding that only **21.8%** of workers earned a local minimum wage after deducting work-related costs like fuel, vehicle maintenance, and platform service charges. This statistic indicates that a majority of workers are earning wages that do not adequately cover their living expenses.

### Increased Working Hours
A more alarming trend noted in the study is the rise in working hours that platform workers need to put in to earn a minimum wage. Initially, around **60%** of workers were logging more than **48 hours a week** to meet minimum wage standards. This figure has since surged to **84%**, demonstrating that a vast majority of gig workers are required to exceed standard full-time hours to reach a basic income level. This increase in working hours implies that the gig economy, often heralded as offering flexibility and autonomy, can demand excessive work that strains workers’ health and personal lives.

### Challenges in Defining Gig Work
The **NITI Aayog** report, which characterizes gig work as part-time, has come under scrutiny for its interpretation. The reality that gig workers often work more than **12 hours a day** challenges the notion of “part-time” work. This characterization fails to acknowledge the long, grueling hours that workers need to commit to earning what can barely be called a living wage. This discrepancy between classification and reality raises concerns about policy and labor protections, as many of these workers operate in a space that lacks formal regulation and benefits.

### Costs and Deductions
Platform workers face numerous operational costs that significantly affect their net earnings. Expenses such as **fuel, vehicle maintenance, service fees, and insurance** can erode a substantial portion of their earnings, leaving them with far less than the local minimum wage. These hidden costs are a significant burden, yet platforms and regulatory bodies often overlook them when assessing compensation structures.

### The Reality of ‘Flexibility’
While platforms often market gig work as flexible and offering workers control over their schedules, the study indicates that this flexibility comes with substantial trade-offs. The need to work over 48 hours per week to meet basic income levels suggests that the perceived advantages of gig work, like work-life balance and autonomy, may be overstated. Workers may have to work at odd hours, accept undesirable shifts, or work under pressure to maintain income levels, further challenging the flexibility narrative.

### Policy and Regulatory Concerns
The characterization of gig work as part-time by **NITI Aayog** points to broader issues in policy framing. Gig workers, despite their extensive contributions, often fall outside the purview of traditional labor laws that ensure minimum wage, benefits, and job security. This leaves them vulnerable to exploitation and economic instability. Policies that recognize gig workers as part-time may fail to provide them with critical protections like health benefits, paid leave, or pensions.

To ensure fair treatment, it is crucial that policymakers recognize gig work as a legitimate form of employment deserving of the same rights and benefits that apply to full-time work. Regulatory frameworks need to adapt to the realities of gig work, establishing minimum standards for pay, working hours, and benefits, as well as addressing platform accountability.

### Steps Toward Better Protection
- **Minimum Wage Enforcement**: Authorities must ensure that platforms comply with minimum wage laws after accounting for costs like fuel and maintenance.
- **Regulation of Working Hours**: Setting standards for maximum working hours and providing compensation for overtime can help prevent worker exploitation.
- **Benefits and Protections**: Gig workers should have access to essential benefits such as health insurance, paid leave, and retirement plans.
- **Transparent Cost Structures**: Platforms must provide clarity on the cost structures and fees imposed on workers, ensuring that workers understand their net earnings.

### Conclusion
The findings by Fairwork and the growing discourse around the inadequacies in recognizing gig work highlight the need for a paradigm shift in how gig labor is defined, regulated, and compensated. As more individuals turn to platform-based work as a primary source of income, ensuring fair wages, reasonable working conditions, and comprehensive protections are essential steps towards a just and sustainable gig economy.

> The **Fairwork project** in India found that while more workers are earning through gig platforms like food delivery and taxi services, only **21.8%** make the local minimum wage after deducting costs like fuel and maintenance. Alarmingly, the percentage of those working more than **48 hours per week** to reach minimum wage has risen from **60% to 84%** over four years. The **NITI Aayog** report, which labels gig work as part-time, fails to reflect the reality of 12+ hour workdays. This misclassification impacts policy, leaving gig workers without adequate wage protection, benefits, or job security, necessitating urgent regulatory reforms.

# U.P. orders probe after 10 newborns die in hospital fire

The tragic incident in **Uttar Pradesh**, where 10 newborns lost their lives in a hospital fire, underscores serious issues in hospital infrastructure, safety protocols, and emergency preparedness. Such incidents often result from a combination of factors, including inadequate safety standards, faulty electrical systems, lack of fire safety equipment, and poor enforcement of building regulations.

### 1. **Reasons for Hospital Fires**
- **Outdated Infrastructure**: Many hospitals, particularly in government-run facilities, operate with outdated or poorly maintained infrastructure. Faulty wiring, overloaded electrical circuits, and substandard construction materials contribute to the risk of fire.
- **Non-compliance with Safety Regulations**: Fire safety regulations, including the installation of fire alarms, sprinklers, and fire extinguishers, are often neglected due to budget constraints or lack of oversight. Regular inspections are not always conducted to ensure compliance.
- **Poor Emergency Preparedness**: Hospitals frequently lack comprehensive emergency response plans, and staff are often not adequately trained in fire safety procedures. This can result in slow and chaotic responses during emergencies, leading to preventable casualties.
- **Absence of Fire Drills**: Regular fire drills are essential for preparing staff and ensuring that patients can be evacuated quickly. Many healthcare facilities fail to conduct these drills, resulting in staff being ill-equipped to handle emergencies.
- **Overcrowded Facilities**: High patient intake can lead to overcrowded wards, obstructed exits, and corridors filled with equipment and supplies, which hinder evacuation efforts and increase fire hazards.

### 2. **Preventive Measures**
To avoid similar tragedies in the future, hospitals must implement and adhere to stringent fire safety measures. Here are essential steps to ensure safety:

- **Regular Safety Audits**: Conduct periodic safety audits and risk assessments to identify potential fire hazards. Ensure that all hospital areas comply with national and state fire safety regulations.
- **Upgraded Infrastructure**: Modernize hospital infrastructure to meet current safety standards, including upgrading electrical wiring and ensuring the use of fire-retardant building materials.
- **Installation of Fire Safety Equipment**: Equip hospitals with functional fire alarms, smoke detectors, sprinklers, and fire extinguishers. These systems must be regularly tested and maintained.
- **Training and Drills**: Provide comprehensive fire safety training for all hospital staff, including evacuation procedures, handling fire safety equipment, and assisting patients. Conduct regular fire drills to build confidence and preparedness.
- **Clear Emergency Exits**: Ensure that emergency exits are accessible, unobstructed, and clearly marked. Keep hallways and passages clear of clutter and hospital equipment to facilitate smooth evacuation.
- **Emergency Response Plans**: Develop and regularly update detailed emergency response plans. Hospitals should create clear protocols that specify the roles and responsibilities of staff during a fire.

### **Conclusion**
The tragic deaths of 10 newborns in the U.P. hospital fire are a somber reminder of the importance of stringent fire safety measures and emergency preparedness in healthcare facilities. The incident calls for immediate action to upgrade infrastructure, enforce compliance with fire safety regulations, and train hospital staff to respond effectively to emergencies.
