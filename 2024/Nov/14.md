# Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of the country 

**Jawaharlal Nehru**, born on November 14, 1889, in Allahabad (now Prayagraj), was an influential leader of the Indian independence movement and the first Prime Minister of independent India. His tenure from **1947 to 1964** was marked by significant contributions to nation-building, laying the foundation for India’s modern political and social structure. Here’s a detailed explanation of Nehru’s life, political career, philosophy, and legacy:

### 1. **Early Life and Education**
- **Family Background**: Nehru was born into a wealthy and politically influential family. His father, **Motilal Nehru**, was a prominent lawyer and a key figure in the Indian National Congress. His mother, **Swarup Rani Nehru**, came from a Kashmiri Brahmin family.
- **Education**: Nehru received his early education at home under private tutors and later went to **Harrow School** in England. He pursued his higher studies at **Trinity College, Cambridge**, and studied law at **Inns of Court School of Law** (Inner Temple), London. This education exposed him to Western liberal and socialist ideas, which would later shape his political thought.

### 2. **Role in the Indian Freedom Struggle**
- **Joining the Congress**: Nehru joined the **Indian National Congress** in 1919 and quickly rose through the ranks under the mentorship of **Mahatma Gandhi**. He was deeply influenced by Gandhi’s philosophy of **non-violence** and **civil disobedience**, although Nehru’s views leaned more toward a modern and industrial vision for India.
- **Leadership and Imprisonments**: Nehru participated in significant movements such as the **Non-Cooperation Movement** (1920–22) and the **Civil Disobedience Movement** (1930–34). His active participation led to multiple imprisonments by the British colonial government.
- **Independence and Partition**: Nehru played a crucial role in the negotiations leading to India’s independence in 1947. However, independence came with the partition of British India into India and Pakistan, a painful process that resulted in widespread communal violence and displacement.

### 3. **Prime Ministership (1947–1964)**
Nehru’s tenure as Prime Minister laid the foundation for India’s policies and development. His leadership focused on several key areas:

- **Constitutional Democracy**: Nehru was committed to building a democratic, secular state. He worked with **Dr. B.R. Ambedkar**, chairman of the **Constitution Drafting Committee**, to ensure the Indian Constitution enshrined principles of **liberty**, **equality**, and **justice**.
- **Economic Policies**: Nehru envisioned India as a modern, self-reliant, and industrial nation. He implemented a **mixed economy** model that combined private enterprise with significant state control of critical sectors, establishing public sector undertakings in steel, mining, heavy engineering, and energy. This approach aimed to promote industrialization, reduce poverty, and build infrastructure.
- **Five-Year Plans**: Under Nehru’s leadership, India adopted the **Five-Year Plans** inspired by the Soviet model to develop agriculture, boost industries, and increase employment. The first plan (1951–1956) focused on the agricultural sector, while subsequent plans prioritized industrial and technological growth.
- **Non-Aligned Movement (NAM)**: Nehru was one of the key architects of the **Non-Aligned Movement**, which sought to create an independent path for newly decolonized nations in the midst of the Cold War. He believed in maintaining strategic autonomy by not aligning with any major power bloc (the United States or the Soviet Union).
- **Panchsheel Principles**: Nehru advocated for peaceful coexistence between nations and, alongside **Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai**, established the **Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence (Panchsheel)**, which became the cornerstone of India’s foreign policy.
- **Educational Reforms**: Nehru strongly believed in the importance of education for India’s progress. He established institutions of higher learning, such as the **Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs)** and **All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS)**, to foster technological and medical advancements. He also promoted **scientific temper**, leading to the creation of the **Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)** and **Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)**.

### 4. **Social and Cultural Contributions**
- **Secularism**: Nehru was a staunch advocate of secularism, ensuring that India’s pluralistic society remained inclusive, with no single religion dominating the state.
- **Cultural Development**: Nehru emphasized unity in diversity and supported arts, culture, and heritage. He believed that a strong national identity was essential for a newly independent country to thrive while preserving its rich history.

### 5. **Challenges and Criticisms**
- **Economic Shortcomings**: Although Nehru’s industrial policies laid the groundwork for future development, critics argue that his focus on heavy industries came at the cost of agriculture and small-scale industries, leading to slow economic growth and persistent poverty.
- **China Conflict**: The **Sino-Indian War of 1962** was a major blow to Nehru’s leadership. Despite the Panchsheel agreement, China launched a military offensive against India, revealing weaknesses in defense preparedness and strategic planning. This event tarnished Nehru’s image and was seen as a failure of his foreign policy.
- **Centralization**: Nehru was sometimes criticized for centralizing power and promoting policies that expanded the role of the state, which some believe stifled private enterprise and delayed economic liberalization.

### 6. **Legacy**
Nehru’s legacy is complex but undeniably profound. He is remembered as the visionary who laid the foundation for modern India, promoting democracy, secularism, and scientific progress. **Children’s Day** is celebrated on November 14, his birthday, in recognition of his deep affection for children and his belief in the importance of nurturing young minds for the country’s future. 

Despite the criticisms, Nehru's role as a nation-builder is well-regarded, with policies that influenced India's path for decades. His vision of a pluralistic, democratic India continues to resonate as an integral part of the country's identity.

> Jawaharlal Nehru, India’s first Prime Minister from 1947 to 1964, played a pivotal role in shaping modern India. A leader of the Indian independence movement, Nehru was committed to building a democratic, secular state. He established economic policies focused on a mixed economy, spearheaded **Five-Year Plans**, and promoted education by founding institutions like the **IITs** and **AIIMS**.

# India’s tea, sugar exports raise sustainability concerns at home

India is one of the world’s largest agricultural product exporters. Indian agricultural export was valued at $53.1 billion in 2022-23, up from $8.7 billion in 2004-05, a six-fold increase in less than two decades. For an economically developing economy like India, exports play a significant role in strengthening the economy by increasing revenue, foreign exchange, and transactional options. But the rapid surge in exports poses multiple challenges to sustainability of the production, processing, and distribution systems of the respective commodities.

### In this context, it’s important to answer two questions regarding the sustainability of an agricultural commodity.

First, when can an agricultural commodity be considered truly sustainable? The sustainability of such a commodity isn’t just about economic sustainability, which is driven by productivity. Ecological and social factors, aided by good governance, help build a sustainable production system, so the sustainability of an agricultural system depends on three pillars: ecological factors, economic aspects, andsocial aspects, underpinned by robust policies underlying all of them.

Second, should sustainability considerations only apply to production? No. Since the lifecycle of a commodity extends across pre-sowing, on-farm production, and post-harvest stages, sustainability applies to them all. Tea and sugar, two prominent commodities in India with alarge domestic and export-oriented consumption base, offer good examples to illustrate the problems herein.

### Tea

India is the world’s fourth-largest tea exporter and second-largest producer, contributing 10% of global exports. The latter totalled 188.76 million kg in 2022, with a value of $641.34 million, and an increase of 21.47% year on year in volume and 12.43% year on year in value. The total value of Indian tea exports for 2022-23 was $793.78 million. Domestic consumption constitutes 80% of total production. The top export destinations of Indian tea are the United Arab Emirates, Russia, Iran, the U.S. and the U.K.

There is also growing evidence of stresses being imposed on production systems across the tea value chain. Three major challenges in the tea industry are themanagement of human-wildlife interactions, burgeoning chemical use, and labour concerns. An estimated 70% oftea plantations are situated at the periphery of forests and host the migratory routes elephants need to move around, resulting in frequent interactions with humans and human property and damage.

Likewise, synthetic pesticides constitute up to 85% of total pesticide use in tea plantations. This degree of reliance on such pesticides increases thechemical residue in thefinal product. Researchers have already documented an increase in the incidence of DDT, Endosulfan 35 EC, Dicofol 18.5 EC, and Cypermethrin 10 EC in tea. Exposure to these substances can increase the risk of cancer, diabetes, impaired neurodevelopment in children, and neurotoxicity.

Finally, the labour rights and working conditions of the tea estates cannot be undermined. More than half of tea plantation workers are women and they are often underpaid. The working conditions are also hazardous and workers often lack protective gear. Despite regulations under the Plantations Labour Act 1951 (amended in 2010 to strengthen worker safety), safety standards are almost never fully enforced. There is a critical need for better management practices in and around tea estates in India, stricter monitoring of the maximum residue limits for pesticides, and better enforcement of existing labour regulations.

### Sugar

India is the world’s second-largest sugar producer, with 34 million metric tonnes of production, which is about a fifth of the global production. India’s sugar exports grew by 291% from $1,177 million in FY 2013-14 to $4,600 million in FY 2021-22 and 64.90% in 2021-22. The country exported sugar to 121 countries, according to the Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics. About 50 million farmers depend on sugar cane cultivation in India. An additional half million depend on sugar and allied factories. According to NITI Aayog, the industry has an annual turnover of ₹1 lakh crore.

But for the exports’ economic value and the industry’s significant rural employment, it also has considerable adverse environmental effects — but in particular water resource management.

Sugar cane is well-known for requiring a lot of water to cultivate. On average, 1 kg of sugar requires between 1,500 and 2,000 kg of water. Sugar cane and paddy occupy around 25% of the gross cropped area in India and consume 60% of the country’s total irrigation water, reducing the availability for other crops and also stressing groundwater resources. In the last six or seven years, the area under sugar cane cultivation has almost doubled in Karnataka and Maharashtra.

Natural ecosystems like grasslands and savannahs in these states have also been converted to plant sugar cane. Along with the ensuing biodiversity loss, this change has increased the pressure on water resources and increased the need for sustainable water use and alternate cropping patterns. In fact, Implementing drip irrigation in these States could lower water consumption by 40-50%.

The social dynamics of sugar industries narrate another story. Media reports have unearthed poor working conditions, including long working hours.

Rising temperatures in peninsular India acts as a threat multiplier, increasing the risks to workers’ physical and mental well-being. Workers trapped in vicious debt cycles incur even more stress. Strengthening regulations and encouraging structured and responsible production practices are important to reduce these effects and promote sustainability.

### Millets

Even as the sustainability challenges of these commodities persist, there are others that promote long-term ecological and socio-economic sustainability, and their successes could serve as templates to address the problems plaguing tea and sugar.

One prime example is millets, a sustainable option with which to increase domestic consumption as well as exports. Millets are resilient to harsh conditions and don’t require more inputs to weather resource constraints. They preserve soil health and ensure nutritional security.

The growing importance ofmillet export is evident in the export statistics. India reached a major milestone in 2021-22 when it exported millets valued at $62.95 million, up from $26.97 million in 2020-21, almost a 2.5-fold increase in a single year. In FY 2022-23, the country shipped 169,049.11 metric tonnes of millets and millet-related products worth $75.45 million. This rising demand highlights their potential as a sustainable agricultural commodity contributing to economic growth and environmental resilience.

Agricultural commodity production in India lives in a unique context: alarge domestic consumption base and now a rapidly growing export base. These dynamics may benefit producers and consumers but they could also yield a paradox: whereby increasing dependencies between different actors in the supply chain compromise ecological and social sustainability concerns. There are successful tales of increasing production and trade volumes but concerns also continue regarding the trickling down of some of those economic benefits to producers and farm labourers, and regarding the vitality of India’s natural resources.

There needs to be more focus on addressing environmental issues andsafeguarding thehealth and safety of both workers and consumers to develop an inclusive agrarian economy that benefits both local communities and global markets.

> India's rising tea and sugar exports have sparked sustainability concerns domestically. Increased exports are straining water resources, as both crops are water-intensive and heavily reliant on irrigation, impacting regions already facing water scarcity. The expansion in production to meet export demands also puts pressure on land use, leading to potential environmental degradation and deforestation. Additionally, the reliance on chemical fertilizers and pesticides in tea and sugar cultivation raises issues related to soil health and pollution. Balancing export growth with sustainable practices is crucial to prevent long-term harm to local ecosystems and ensure resource availability for future generations.

# ‘Unwieldy’ first draft at Baku sets 2030 goal of $5 trillion for climate action

At the annual COP29 climate conference in Baku, delegates reached an initial draft agreement aimed at boosting global climate action, setting an ambitious financial target of $5 trillion by 2030. This draft, however, has been described as “unwieldy” due to its complex and extensive stipulations. The proposal outlines that the funds would be used for significant climate mitigation and adaptation measures, especially in vulnerable and developing nations. The draft aims to establish a roadmap for achieving these goals while holding nations accountable for contributing to the fund and implementing effective climate strategies.

### Background and Significance
The $5 trillion target marks a substantial step up from current global funding efforts for climate initiatives. This goal reflects the urgent need for scaled-up action to meet the **Paris Agreement** targets of limiting global temperature rise to below 2°C, with an aspirational aim of 1.5°C. Developing nations, which are often the most affected by climate change but have the least resources to combat its impacts, have long called for more substantial financial commitments from wealthier countries. This draft seeks to address these calls by setting a firm, collective target for funding.

### Challenges of Implementation
Despite its ambitious nature, the draft’s complexity poses challenges to its implementation. One key issue is ensuring equitable contributions from participating countries, particularly balancing the responsibilities of developed versus developing nations. Historically, wealthier nations have been slow to meet existing financial pledges, which raises concerns about the feasibility of achieving this new, larger goal. Another challenge lies in the distribution and management of funds to ensure they are effectively used for projects that mitigate climate change and adapt infrastructure and communities to its impacts.

### Expected Impact and Opportunities
If the $5 trillion target is met, it could lead to significant advancements in renewable energy projects, sustainable infrastructure, disaster resilience programs, and the transition to a green economy. These investments are expected to create jobs, foster innovation, and drive global economic growth while helping nations meet their emission reduction targets. For developing countries, it presents an opportunity to build climate-resilient societies and reduce the socio-economic impacts of climate change.

### Road Ahead
The next steps involve refining the draft to ensure that its mechanisms are practical and enforceable. This includes clarifying the roles of various stakeholders, setting transparent accountability measures, and building consensus on contributions. While the “unwieldy” nature of the draft indicates the complexity of the task, it also highlights the global community’s recognition of the urgent need for transformative action to tackle climate change. The finalized agreement, expected to be negotiated further in the coming months, will be pivotal in shaping the global climate agenda through 2030 and beyond.

# The perfect cocktail of layered discrimination

### Delimitation: A Challenge to India's Federal Structure

The issue of **delimitation** has re-emerged as a significant and contentious challenge facing the Indian Union, raising complex questions about the future of its federal structure and balance of power. Delimitation refers to the process of redrawing the boundaries of electoral constituencies to reflect changes in population distribution and demographics. While intended to ensure fair representation, the process carries significant political, social, and constitutional implications, making it the proverbial “elephant in the room” for policymakers and citizens alike.

### Historical Context and Deferred Action

The topic of delimitation is not new. Notable leaders like **Indira Gandhi** and **Atal Bihari Vajpayee** recognized its potential to cause upheaval and consciously postponed addressing it. This deferral has left current and future generations with the responsibility of handling a deeply sensitive issue that could reshape the nation’s political landscape. Today, as the Indian Union stands at a crossroads, the question arises: do we further delay this decision, risk triggering social and political conflict, or seek to manage and defuse its potential dangers through prudent action?

### Implications of Delimitation on Federalism

**Federalism** is an essential and inviolable part of the basic structure of the **Constitution of India**. The country’s political framework is based on the principle that power is shared between the central government and the states, which are considered federating units. Unlike administrative divisions in a unitary system, these states have political significance rooted in historical, cultural, and linguistic identities. Many states trace their origins to ancient ethno-linguistic homelands that have existed for centuries or even millennia. This deep-rooted cultural and linguistic diversity was recognized during the reorganization of states in the 1950s, which aimed to create political units based on linguistic lines to maintain harmony and preserve identity.

The **Supreme Court of India** has consistently reinforced that states are not arbitrary administrative units but political entities that contribute to the country’s complex federal structure. This acknowledgment highlights the significance of any action, such as delimitation, that could impact the balance of representation between states.

### Demographic Shifts and Representation

The central issue behind delimitation is the uneven population growth across states. States in the northern part of India, such as **Uttar Pradesh** and **Bihar**, have seen higher population growth rates compared to southern states like **Kerala**, **Tamil Nadu**, and **Karnataka**, which have effectively controlled their growth through progressive measures. This demographic shift has led to a situation where representation in the **Lok Sabha** (the lower house of Parliament) is increasingly disproportionate. A delimitation exercise that recalibrates representation based on the current population could shift political power toward more populous states, potentially diluting the influence of less populous regions, many of which are in the south and have distinct ethno-linguistic identities.

### Risks of Ethno-Linguistic Imbalance

A significant concern is the potential erosion of the delicate federal balance and the risk of transforming India into an **ethno-linguistic majoritarian state**. If the representation in Parliament becomes skewed heavily in favor of more populous northern states, it could lead to feelings of marginalization among the less populous southern states. This may fuel regional discontent, political movements, and even “ethno-linguistic mutinies,” challenging national unity. The diverse mosaic that makes up the Indian Union could be threatened if these states perceive that their political and cultural identities are being compromised for the benefit of more populous regions.

### The Path Forward: Options and Solutions

India is at a historical crossroad that requires statesmanship and foresight. The response to delimitation can take one of three forms:

1. **Postponement**: Continuing to delay the process may provide short-term stability but risks exacerbating the problem as demographic imbalances grow wider over time. This approach has limitations and could lead to larger issues in future decades.
   
2. **Radical Implementation**: Implementing delimitation without sufficient safeguards could trigger significant political and social tensions. The shift in representation could be perceived as an attack on the federal spirit, leading to unrest and undermining national cohesion.

3. **Balanced Approach**: The most viable option is to “defuse” the situation by carefully balancing the need for fair representation with respect for the federal structure and regional identities. This could involve constitutional amendments or innovative solutions such as creating additional seats that preserve representation balance or ensuring that delimitation respects regional diversity while adjusting for population growth. Additionally, forming a cross-party, multi-stakeholder commission to explore potential safeguards would allow for more inclusive policy-making.

### Conclusion

Delimitation poses a profound challenge that impacts the foundational principles of India’s democracy and federal structure. As a nation of unparalleled diversity, India must approach this issue with caution, recognizing that states are more than mere administrative units—they are political and cultural expressions of the Indian Union. The solution lies in fostering dialogue, ensuring that changes are equitable and preserving the fabric of federalism that binds India together. Delimitation, if handled with foresight and fairness, can enhance representation without compromising the unity and diversity that define India.

> Delimitation, the process of redrawing electoral boundaries, poses a significant challenge to India's federal structure. While leaders like Indira Gandhi and Atal Bihari Vajpayee postponed addressing it, current demographic shifts demand action. The concern is that recalibrating representation based on population could shift political power to more populous northern states, marginalizing southern states with lower population growth and distinct ethno-linguistic identities. This may threaten the balance of federalism and fuel regional discontent. The solution lies in a balanced approach that ensures fair representation while respecting regional diversity, safeguarding the federal spirit, and promoting national unity through careful, inclusive policy-making.

# SC puts brakes on ‘bulldozer culture’ 

The Supreme Court's decision to put a stop to the widespread use of bulldozers for demolishing properties without due legal process—commonly referred to as the “bulldozer culture”—is a significant step toward upholding the rule of law and ensuring that administrative actions remain within the bounds of constitutional principles. This decision has wide-ranging implications for legal practices, citizens' rights, and the role of state authority.

### 1. **Upholding the Rule of Law**
The Supreme Court’s directive reinforces the foundational legal principle that **no one is above the law**, not even state authorities. By curbing the use of bulldozers to demolish properties without prior notice or due process, the court affirms that any action taken by the state must be in line with established legal procedures. This ensures that property owners, regardless of the allegations against them, are entitled to proper notice, a fair hearing, and the opportunity to contest the decision in court before any punitive measures are enacted.

This move will have an impact on the way state authorities approach urban planning and enforcement actions. Instead of unilateral, swift demolitions that bypass legal protocols, authorities will need to adhere to legal standards and follow the procedures mandated by the judiciary. This shift ensures that administrative actions are transparent, accountable, and in alignment with citizens' constitutional rights.

### 2. **Protection of Fundamental Rights**
The right to property, while no longer a fundamental right, is still protected under **Article 300A** of the Indian Constitution, which states that no person shall be deprived of their property except by the authority of law. The Supreme Court’s intervention underscores the significance of this protection. The so-called “bulldozer culture,” where properties were razed as an extrajudicial form of punishment, often targeted marginalized or politically disfavored groups and led to allegations of discrimination and misuse of state power.

By reining in such practices, the court ensures that the **fundamental rights** of citizens, such as the **right to equality (Article 14)** and **protection from arbitrary action**, are upheld. This protects individuals from potential misuse of power by the authorities and preserves the basic principles of due process and fairness.

### 3. **Impact on Governance and Accountability**
The ruling necessitates a change in how local and state governments implement their policies related to urban development, encroachment clearance, and law enforcement. The judgment implies that officials will now be held more accountable for actions that might previously have been taken without substantial checks and balances. Authorities must demonstrate that any demolition follows a legally sound process, with adequate documentation and compliance with laws governing land and property rights.

This shift will promote a more structured and law-abiding approach, compelling governments to provide clear justifications for property demolitions. It will also empower citizens to seek redress and challenge unlawful demolitions, thereby fostering a more balanced power dynamic between the state and the public.

### 4. **Curtailment of Political Misuse**
The court’s stand on this issue may reduce the political misuse of demolition drives, which have often been criticized as tools for retributive action against political opponents or dissenting groups. By mandating due process, the judiciary prevents the arbitrary and discriminatory application of state power, which could otherwise be used to intimidate or punish certain communities or individuals without sufficient legal grounds. This promotes a more just and impartial administration that respects democratic values.

### 5. **Future Legal and Policy Frameworks**
The Supreme Court’s decision will likely influence future laws and policies related to urban planning and enforcement. Legislatures and policymakers may need to review existing laws and frameworks to ensure compliance with the Supreme Court’s directives. This could lead to amendments that reinforce procedural safeguards, including stricter regulations around eviction and demolition, and more robust mechanisms for the protection of property rights.

### **Conclusion**
The Supreme Court's action to curb the "bulldozer culture" reinforces constitutional principles and the rule of law, demanding that state actions adhere to due process and protecting citizens from arbitrary and discriminatory practices. This directive serves as a reminder that law enforcement, while necessary for maintaining order, must not bypass legal procedures or violate fundamental rights. Ultimately, the decision is a pivotal step toward ensuring that governance remains accountable, fair, and within the scope of the law, fostering greater trust in the judicial and administrative systems.

> The Supreme Court's decision to curb the “bulldozer culture” reinforces the rule of law and mandates that state actions follow due legal processes, ensuring fairness and protecting citizens' rights. This move upholds constitutional principles, preventing arbitrary demolitions and safeguarding rights under **Article 300A** and **Article 14**. It compels authorities to follow legal protocols for property actions and enhances accountability in governance. The ruling reduces potential political misuse of demolitions as tools of retribution and promotes impartial administration. This decision will likely lead to reforms in laws and policies related to urban planning, ensuring more structured and lawful enforcement actions.
