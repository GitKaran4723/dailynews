# Why has Gautam Adani been indicted?

On November 21, federal prosecutors in New York indicted Adani Group Chairman Gautam S. Adani, his nephew Sagar Adani, and six others on multiple counts of fraud. The charges stem from an alleged multibillion-dollar scheme to bribe Indian officials in exchange for favourable terms on solar power contracts, which were projected to generate over $2 billion in profits. “This indictment alleges schemes to pay over $250 million in bribes to Indian government officials, to lie to investors and banks to raise billions of dollars, and to obstruct justice,” a press release issued by the U.S. Attorney’s Office, Eastern District of New York, said quoting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Lisa Miller.

### Who are the defendants?

The defendants named in the case, alongside Gautam Adani and his nephew Sagar Adani (executive director of Adani Green Energy), include — Vneet Jaain, former CEO of Adani Green Energy; Ranjit Gupta, who served as CEO of Azure Power Global from 2019 to 2022; Rupesh Agarwal, who headed Azure Power Global from 2022 to 2023; Cyril Cabanes, former managing director of Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ) which is a majority stockholder of Azure Power; Saurabh Agarwal, former managing director of CDPQ India; and Deepak Malhotra, former executive of CDPQ.

### What is the heart of the indictment?

A novel tender floated by the state-owned Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) in 2019 forms the heart of the indictment that has accused the Adani Group Chairman and his associates of paying over $250 million in bribes to Indian government officials. The manufacturing-linked solar tender was eventually awarded to Adani Green Energy and Azure Power with the former claiming in a press statement at the time that it had won “the world’s largest solar award”. According to the indictment, the $6 billion investment was projected to yield over $2 billion in post-tax profits over 20 years. However, the project encountered an unexpected setback — SECI was unable to sign power supply agreements (PSAs) with State electricity distribution companies (DISCOMs) due to “high energy prices”. At this point, Adani Green executives allegedly bribed government officials in several States, including Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Chhattisgarh, and Jammu and Kashmir, to pressure their power distribution companies into agreeing to purchase solar power at above-market rates. The U.S. case is based on the premise that this is where the corruption took place, and that Adani Green failed to disclose this information to its investors in the U.S., constituting fraud under federal securities law.

The U.S. prosecutors have further alleged that Gautam Adani personally met with an unnamed “high-ranking government official of Andhra Pradesh” in August 2021 to expedite the execution of a PSA between SECI and the State’s DISCOMs, during which approximately ₹1,750 crore (85% of the alleged bribe) was purportedly offered to the official.

### What are the charges?

The indictment accuses Adani and his associates of conspiring to bribe Indian officials to secure energy contracts in a purported violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). Although enacted in 1977, the law has been more stringently enforced in recent decades resulting in substantial fines for major companies, including Germany’s Siemens, Brazil’s state-owned Petrobras, and a subsidiary of Halliburton, the oil services giant.

President-elect Donald J. Trump reportedly wanted to strike down the legislation in his first term since he considered it “unfair” to American companies. Another prominent critic of the law, Jay Clayton, whom Trump appointed as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, contended in a 2011 paper that U.S. anti-bribery policies disproportionately burdened American companies in international transactions, thereby undermining U.S. competitiveness.

The prosecutors have alleged that the defendants meticulously tracked their bribes and offers to Indian officials using messaging apps, phones, and PowerPoint presentations, often employing “code names” in their communications. It was further claimed that two of the defendants even engaged in discussions to delete “incriminating electronic materials, including emails, electronic messages and a PowerPoint analysis.”

The defendants also stand accused of engaging in securities and wire fraud to fund the operations of Adani Green Energy and its subsidiaries. They allegedly concealed FCPA violations to secure over $3 billion in bank loans from international financial institutions and U.S.-based asset management firms. “Gautam and Sagar Adani were engaged in the bribery scheme during a September 2021 note offering by Adani Green that raised $750 million, including approximately $175 million from U.S. investors. The Adani Green offering materials included statements about its anti-corruption and anti-bribery efforts that were materially false or misleading,” the indictment said. Additionally, Adani and his associates have been accused of withholding information from U.S. investors as well as Indian stock exchanges regarding ongoing federal investigations into their business practices in 2023 and 2024.


Former employees of CDPQ — Cyril Cabanes, Saurabh Agarwal, and Deepak Malhotra — have been accused of obstructing an investigation into the bribery scheme by deleting emails and agreeing to provide false information to the U.S. government. In response to the indictment, CDPQ issued a statement saying, “CDPQ is aware of charges filed in the U.S. against certain former employees. Those employees were all terminated in 2023 and CDPQ is co-operating with U.S. authorities. In light of the pending cases, we have no further comment at this time.”

### What about the civil lawsuit?

The U.S. Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) has filed a parallel civil lawsuit against Adani and his associates “for conduct arising out of a massive bribery scheme”. The complaint alleges that they engaged in a scheme that involved “paying or promising to pay the equivalent of hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes to Indian government officials to secure their commitment to purchase energy at above-market rates”. This was reportedly done while simultaneously raising $175 million from U.S. investors, based on “materially false and misleading” statements. If proven, the charges could invite hefty financial penalties and a ban on the defendants from holding directorial or executive positions in companies that fall under U.S. exchange regulations.

### What happens next?

The U.S. prosecutors have sought the forfeiture of properties or proceeds derived directly or indirectly as a result of the offences. The case will now proceed to the “arraignment” stage where the concerned judge will formally communicate the charges to the defendants and decide whether to grant bail or not. The defendants will then be required to enter a plea — either guilty or not guilty. If they plead not guilty, the case will move forward to a jury trial. However, there is also a possibility of a deal being struck between the Indian tycoon and U.S. authorities following which the billionaire could seek a dismissal of the indictment.

As soon as news of the indictment broke, Adani Green Energy Ltd, the company at the heart of the allegations, cancelled a $600 million bond sale, the proceeds of which were intended to refinance a foreign-currency loan. Several Adani Group shares, including those of the flagship firm Adani Enterprises, also suffered massive losses and hit their lower circuits in early trade. An Adani Group spokesperson, however, dismissed the allegations as baseless, asserting that the conglomerate remains fully compliant with all applicable laws. In a notable fallout, Kenyan President William Ruto has announced the cancellation of a procurement process expected to hand over control of the country’s main airport to the Adani Group. A 30-year, $736-million public-private partnership deal the Kenyan energy ministry had signed with a unit of the Adani Group last month to construct power transmission lines has also been cancelled.

> Indian billionaire Gautam Adani has been indicted in the United States on charges of securities fraud and conspiracy. The indictment alleges that Adani and his associates orchestrated a scheme to pay over $250 million in bribes to Indian government officials to secure lucrative solar energy contracts. They are accused of concealing these bribes from U.S. investors while raising funds through loans and bond offerings. The charges include securities fraud, wire fraud, violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and obstruction of justice.

# India’s urban infrastructure financing, needs and reality

India’s urban population will increase from **400 million in the last decade to 800 million** over the next three decades. While this offers an opportunity to transform India’s urban landscape, there are significant financial challenges that must be overcome to get there. A recent **World Bank report** estimates that India will require about ₹70 lakh crore by 2036 to meet its urban infrastructure needs. Current government investment (2018 figures) in urban infrastructure stands at around ₹1.3 lakh crore annually. This is just a little over one-fourth of the required ₹4.6 lakh crore per year. Broadly, about 50% is estimated for basic urban services, with the other half for urban transport.

### Issues at the local level

Municipal finances, a crucial component of urban infrastructure funding, have remained stagnant for decades. Since 2002, municipal finance has stayed at just 1% of GDP. Municipal bodies contribute 45% of urban investments, while the remainder is managed by parastatal agencies. Despite an increase in central and State transfers from 37% to 44%, the financial health of municipalities remains precarious. Tax revenue grew by only 8% between 2010 and 2018, grants by 14%, and non-tax revenue by 10.5%. However, the share of municipalities’ own revenue sources has declined from 51% to 43%, reflecting a diminishing capacity for self-sufficiency.

Collection inefficiencies also exist in **urban local bodies (ULB)**. For instance, data from 2017-18 reveals that ULBs in Bengaluru and Jaipur collect only 5%-20% of their potential tax revenue. Nationwide, property tax collection stands at a paltry ₹25,000 crore, which is only 0.15% of GDP. Further, cost recovery for services ranges from 20% to 50%, highlighting the significant gap between the costs of urban services and the revenues generated from them.

Indian cities also struggle with low absorptive capacity, further complicating the urban infrastructure landscape. According to the Fifteenth Finance Commission report, about 23% of total municipal revenue remains unspent, indicating a surplus in the municipal system that is not being effectively utilised. Even major cities such as Hyderabad and Chennai only managed to spend 50% of their capital expenditure budgets in 2018-19. The utilisation of central scheme funds also leaves much to be desired, with the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) achieving 80% utilisation and the Smart Cities Mission reaching 70%.

**Public-private partnerships (PPPs)**, another crucial avenue for urban infrastructure financing, have seen a marked decline over the past decade. PPP investments in urban infrastructure peaked at ₹8,353 crore in 2012 but plummeted to just ₹467 crore by 2018. The viability of PPP projects is often dependent on the availability of payments or viability funding for ensuring bankability; but due to the lack of project-specific revenues, these projects further diminish commercial attractiveness.

### The next step is reform

Given the myriad of financial challenges outlined, it is imperative to adopt a dual-pronged approach with specific long-term and medium-term measures. In the long term, carrying out structural reform would be critical. These reforms should include strengthening State finance commissions to enhancing autonomy and capacity for better financial management at the municipal level. Additionally, empowering municipal governments with greater financial and administrative autonomy will be critical in enabling them to manage and allocate resources more effectively for urban development. This can then attract the much-needed private capital, through mechanisms such as debt borrowing, and municipal bonds.

### In the medium term, the following measures can significantly transform the development of sustainable urban infrastructure.

**First**, develop a robust pipeline of projects. The High-Powered Expert Committee and 12th Plan Working Group have developed a financing framework to meet the ₹70 lakh crore urban infrastructure investment requirement over the next 20 years. About 15% of this total investment could potentially come through PPPs, translating to roughly 250-300 PPP projects annually. To achieve this, a pipeline of 600-800 projects must be in place.

**Second**, decouple project preparation from financial assistance. The last two decades have shown that investments in urban infrastructure have not advanced to the extent required, often due to hurried project preparation. As new national programmes are conceived, it is essential to decouple project preparation from financial assistance. Ensuring that these projects are designed for financial, social, and environmental sustainability is vital, especially given India’s vulnerability to climate change.

**Third**, leverage Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) for improved operations. Urban service delivery, particularly in public transport, remains hampered by outdated practices. Embracing DPI can revolutionise the management and the operation of public services, positioning India as a global leader in this domain.

**Fourth**, capture land value in transport projects. With half of the ₹70 lakh crore investment by 2036 earmarked for urban transport, particularly metro rail projects, there is a unique opportunity to harness land value. Metro and rail projects should be integrated with urban development, ensuring that they bring jobs closer to transit hubs and contribute to the overall efficiency and design of cities.

### The need for collaboration

To conclude, India’s urban future hinges on the ability to address these financial and structural challenges head-on. The stakes are high, and this is the window for action. By pursuing both immediate and long-term strategies, India can build urban infrastructure that meets the demands of its growing cities, thus ensuring sustainable and inclusive development for the decades to come. The path forward will require collaboration across government levels, private sector participation, and a relentless focus on innovation and governance efficiency.

> India faces a significant gap in **urban infrastructure financing**, with estimates suggesting the need for **₹80-85 lakh crore** over the next 15 years to support urbanization and improve infrastructure. Challenges include inadequate municipal revenues, reliance on state and central grants, and limited private sector participation. Financing mechanisms like **municipal bonds**, **public-private partnerships (PPPs)**, and government programs like the **AMRUT** and **Smart Cities Mission** are underutilized or insufficient. Enhancing urban local bodies' (ULBs) financial autonomy, promoting innovative funding strategies, and encouraging private investments are crucial. Bridging this gap is essential for sustainable urban growth, economic competitiveness, and better quality of life.

# Maha victory

The recent political developments in **Maharashtra** have not only shaped the trajectory of the state’s governance but also raised significant questions about **democracy, pluralism, and political stability** in India. While the outcome settles certain longstanding issues, it also opens up fresh debates for all stakeholders involved, including political parties, governance frameworks, and the democratic ethos of the nation.

### **1. Settling Longstanding Questions**
The Maharashtra outcome has clarified several contentious issues, particularly concerning **alliances, governance mandates, and legal precedents**.

- **Alliance Dynamics**: The results affirm the importance of stable alliances in Indian politics. The **Shiv Sena split** and subsequent events demonstrated the fragility of coalition arrangements and the consequences of ideological rifts within parties. Political parties are now likely to re-evaluate their strategies, emphasizing cohesion and mutual trust in alliances.

- **Judicial Precedents**: The legal interventions and judgments associated with Maharashtra’s political developments have set significant precedents. These outcomes underline the judiciary's role in maintaining the sanctity of democratic processes, such as upholding anti-defection laws and ensuring that governance transitions follow constitutional mandates.

- **Voter Mandate Interpretation**: The events underscored the importance of respecting the electoral mandate. Parties that deviate from their pre-election promises or form alliances contrary to their ideological stance risk alienating their voter base, as seen in the **Shiv Sena faction’s challenges** post-split.

---

### **2. New Questions for Political Players**
While certain issues have been settled, the Maharashtra outcome also opens new avenues for introspection and strategizing across the political spectrum:

- **Fate of Ideological Politics**: The political maneuvers in Maharashtra blur the lines of ideological fidelity. The reconfiguration of alliances raises questions about the future of ideology-driven politics and whether it will continue to hold relevance in an era dominated by power-centric coalitions.

- **Leadership Stability**: The split within the Shiv Sena has highlighted vulnerabilities in leadership structures. It raises concerns about internal democracy within parties and how dissenting voices are addressed to avoid fragmentation.

- **Role of Institutions**: The events in Maharashtra have brought institutions like the **governor’s office**, **legislative assemblies**, and the **judiciary** under scrutiny. Questions about the impartiality and effectiveness of these institutions in maintaining democratic norms remain unresolved.

- **Voter Trust and Accountability**: The shifting alliances and ideological compromises may have eroded public trust in political systems. This raises the question of how parties plan to rebuild credibility and engage with an increasingly skeptical electorate.

---

### **3. Implications for Democracy and Pluralism**
The Maharashtra outcome has far-reaching implications for Indian democracy and pluralism:

- **Democratic Norms**: Frequent power struggles, party splits, and defections challenge the stability of democratic governance. Ensuring adherence to democratic norms, such as respecting voter mandates and avoiding opportunistic alliances, is critical for sustaining public confidence.

- **Pluralism and Regionalism**: Maharashtra, as a state known for its diverse population and regional identity, underscores the importance of pluralism in governance. Political parties need to prioritize policies that reflect inclusivity and cater to the state’s socio-economic diversity, ensuring equitable development across all regions.

- **Strengthening Anti-Defection Laws**: The events highlight the necessity of revisiting anti-defection laws to prevent misuse and maintain party discipline while respecting individual dissent within political frameworks.

---

### **4. Broader Lessons**
- **Accountability and Transparency**: Political players must prioritize accountability and transparency in decision-making to maintain democratic integrity.
- **Institutional Reforms**: Strengthening democratic institutions and ensuring their independence is essential to avoid partisan biases and uphold constitutional values.
- **Public Engagement**: Rebuilding voter trust through consistent engagement and delivering on promises is imperative for political stability.

---

### **Conclusion**
The Maharashtra political outcome serves as both a lesson and a warning for India’s democracy. While it settles issues regarding alliances, governance, and judicial intervention, it raises profound questions about ideological consistency, institutional integrity, and voter trust. Moving forward, political stakeholders must reflect on these developments to strengthen democratic principles, foster pluralism, and ensure governance stability in a diverse and evolving India.
