# Will financial roadblocks continue to hinder conservation efforts?

The 16th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP16) to the U.N. Convention on Biological Diversity recently concluded in Cali, Colombia. Representatives from U.N. countries tried to negotiate measures to halt and reverse biodiversity loss by 2030, which threatens both human well-being and the stability of human societies. A key sticking point was who’d pay for implementing these measures and how much.

A highlight of COP16 was the engagement of Indigenous people and local communities — but otherwise it raised a big red flag: it revealed countries are not on track to meet the “30x30” target, which calls for the world to protect 30% of the world’s land and oceans by 2030.

### How much of a setback is this?

The highs of COP16

**Inclusive decision-making**: Negotiators reached a landmark agreement to establish a permanent body made up of Indigenous people and members of local communities and agreed this body’s inputs would have to be included in decisions about biodiversity conservation. The move is intended to protect traditional knowledge systems and strengthen their representation and participation in policymaking.

At COP16, negotiators also recognised the role of people of African descent in conserving nature and made sure to include them in biodiversity initiatives and help integrate their traditional knowledge and conservation practices into global efforts.

**Biodiversity funding**: COP16 established a framework called the **‘Cali Fund.’**It obligates major corporations — particularly in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors — to share the financial benefits they derive from using genetic resources with the communities that nurture those resources. Companies have to contribute 0.1% of their revenue or 1% of their profits from products developed using genetic information to the fund. This figure could potentially exceed $1 billion a year and should help support biodiversity conservation projects and benefit local communities.

Half of the money from this fund will be allocated to Indigenous communities to help conservation efforts and to acknowledge their contributions to biodiversity. Contributions to the fund are voluntary, but it is a critical step towards more equitable benefit-sharing in the realm of biodiversity, especially considering the challenges surrounding global financing for biodiversity initiatives.

**Biodiversity defence**: COP16 also proposed guidelines to manage invasive alien species, a direct driver of biodiversity loss, by developing new databases, improving cross-border trade regulations, and enhancing coordination with e-commerce platforms. This decision emphasises the need for technical support, capacity building, and international cooperation across developing countries.

**Momentum for blue**: Negotiators also agreed to a new and upgraded process to identify ‘Ecologically or Biologically Significant Marine Areas’ (EBSAs), which are critical and vulnerable parts of the ocean. This process has faced various political and legal hurdles since its inception in 2008; COP16 revived it by agreeing on mechanisms to update existing ESBAs and identify new ones.

**One Health**: The Global Action Plan on Biodiversity and Health established at COP16 underscores the need for a holistic ”One Health” approach, which calls for a collective focus on ecosystem, animal, and human health. By addressing the common drivers of biodiversity loss and poor health, such as deforestation and climate change, the plan aims to prevent zoonotic diseases, reduce non-communicable diseases, and promote sustainable ecosystems. It also encourages partnerships among health professionals, conservationists, and policymakers to develop tools and measures to track the progress of biodiversity plus health initiatives.

**Innovating with caution**: Redesigning organisms or creating new biological systems (synthetic biology) was an important topic of discussion at COP16. Applications — including bioengineered species for ecosystem restoration or sustainable materials to reduce resource strain — are promising because they can address environmental challenges. However, researchers have raised concerns over the risks involved and the unintended ecological effects of introducing synthetic organisms that could disrupt ecosystems, affecting natural species.

Countries’ representatives also discussed regulatory frameworks to manage these risks and ensure a balance between innovation and conservation.

### The lows of COP16

Among the unresolved issues at the meeting, financial commitments and a lack of a monitoring framework are at the forefront.

Uphill battle for finance: A big bone of contention was the mobilisation of financial resources to meet the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) target of $700 billion a year for biodiversity conservation by 2030, including $30 billion from developed to developing countries. But pledges at the conference totalled only $163 million.

Disagreements over the governance and distribution of funds led to an impasse, with discussions on financial mechanisms being suspended without resolution. This was because developing nations advocated for a dedicated global nature fund for conservation, whereas wealthy nations blocked the proposal due to concerns over fund structure and the idea that existing frameworks were enough to meet financial needs.

Monitoring and implementation: Implementing the GBF was another key issue at COP16, but progress was limited. Only 44 of the 196 countries submitted an updated National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plan (NBSAP) review framework for evaluating their progress through a “global stocktake.” Many countries have still not submitted their NBSAPs. The lack of a mandatory enforcement framework could weaken the goal.

### India at COP16

India unveiled its updated NBSAP at COP16, outlining a roadmap for biodiversity conservation efforts aligned with the GBF. The updated plan aims to halt and reverse biodiversity loss by 2030 and achieve harmonious coexistence with nature by 2050 through a “Whole-of-Government” and “Whole-of-Society” approach.

India is challenged with balancing conservation with economic growth. So the updated NBSAP outlines 23 national biodiversity targets and emphasises a transformative approach to biodiversity conservation and ecosystem restoration. In particular, it focuses on inter-agency cooperation, financial solutions, and involving community members in restoring degraded ecosystems, protecting wetlands, and sustainably managing marine and coastal areas.

Looking ahead

Establishing inclusive decision-making bodies and frameworks for benefit-sharing shows progress. But without adequate financial commitments and robust monitoring mechanisms, reaching the 2030 targets will be difficult.

While nations reflect on the outcomes of COP16, it is clear that conserving biodiversity is crucial for environmental health, socio-economic resilience, and climate stability. For nations like India, where biodiversity is deeply tied to cultural heritage and economic stability, the stakes are particularly high.

Governments must set ambitious targets and take steps to translate these into actionable, measurable, and time-bound goals. Transparency in reporting and shared knowledge systems are vital for tracking progress and addressing gaps. As the world looks forward to COP17 in Armenia next year, collaborative action and cross-border efforts could make or break our ability to beat the triple planetary crises of pollution, climate change, and biodiversity loss.

> Financial roadblocks are likely to continue hindering conservation efforts unless significant changes are made. Funding shortages and inadequate financial support can limit the effectiveness of conservation initiatives, affecting biodiversity protection, habitat preservation, and climate action. Many conservation projects rely on inconsistent or insufficient government and private funding, leading to delays and reduced scope. Addressing these financial challenges requires innovative solutions, such as public-private partnerships, sustainable funding models, and increased global cooperation. Without robust and reliable financial backing, conservation efforts will struggle to achieve long-term success, threatening ecosystems and biodiversity essential for environmental and human well-being.

# Can AMU finally claim a ‘minority’ status?

In a narrow 4-3 majority verdict, the Supreme Court on November 8, overturned its 1967 ruling in S. Azeez Basha versus Union of India, which had previously served as the basis for denying Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) its minority institution status. The majority verdict was penned by former Chief Justice of India (CJI) D.Y. Chandrachud and endorsed by Justices Sanjiv Khanna, J.B. Pardiwala, and Manoj Misra. Justices Surya Kant, Dipankar Datta and S.C. Sharma dissented.

### What is a ‘minority institution’?

**Article 30(1)** of the Constitution guarantees religious and linguistic minorities the fundamental right to establish and manage educational institutions of their choice. Article 30(2) further mandates that the state must ensure “equality of treatment” in granting aid to all educational institutions, regardless of their minority status. Notably, such institutions enjoy greater autonomy than most others. Under Article 15(5), they are exempt from providing reservations for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, and may reserve up to 50% of seats for students from their own community. In the landmark T.M.A. Pai Foundation (2002) case, the Supreme Court clarified that a ‘minority’ status should be determined based on the demographic composition of the concerned State, rather than the national population.

### What is the background of the case?

In 1875, Muslim reformer and educationist Sir Syed Ahmed Khan established the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental (MAO) College in Aligarh to offer modern British education rooted in Islamic values to Muslims. In 1920, the Aligarh Muslim University Act (AMU Act) was passed, incorporating MAO College and the Muslim University Association into AMU. Under Section 23 of the Act, only Muslims were permitted to be members of the university’s governing body, known as the Court. While the institution primarily catered to Muslims, students from other religious communities were also admitted. In 1951, this mandate for Muslim-only representation on the Court was abolished. A subsequent amendment in 1965 redistributed the Court’s powers among other administrative bodies, with provisions allowing the President of India to nominate members to it.

In 1967, the Supreme Court, in Azeez Basha, upheld the amendments to the Act, reasoning that AMU was neither established nor administered by the Muslim minority since it had been established through central legislation. This decision sparked widespread protests, ultimately leading to an amendment of the AMU Act in 1981, which officially recognised the university’s minority status.

In 2005, the university introduced a policy reserving 50% of seats in its postgraduate medical courses for Muslim students. This was subsequently challenged before the Allahabad High Court which struck it down on the ground that the university did not qualify as a minority institution as per the Azeez Basha ruling.

In 2006, a two-judge Bench of the Supreme Court stayed the reservation policy and referred the case to a larger Bench.

In 2019, a three-judge Bench headed by former CJI Ranjan Gogoi referred the Azeez Basha decision for reconsideration by a seven-judge Bench.

The matter stayed in limbo till October 2023 when CJI Chandrachud constituted a seven-judge Bench to hear it.

### What did the majority rule?

Justice Chandrachud, in an expansive interpretation of Article 30, affirmed that educational institutions established prior to the adoption of the Constitution are equally entitled to the protections granted under Article 30(1). He clarified that statutory enactments conferring legal recognition or status upon such institutions do not compromise their minority character, provided their foundational purpose was “predominantly” aimed at benefiting the minority community.

The majority verdict further emphasised that an institution does not forfeit its minority character simply because its administration is no longer vested with the community. The judges reasoned that founders or the minority community might appoint individuals from outside the community to helm the administrative affairs, particularly if the institution seeks to focus on secular education. “This may be the case for professional colleges which offer specialised courses such as law, medicine, or architecture, where the founders may not possess the knowledge, experience, or insight necessary to manage or administer the institution personally,” they added.

Accordingly, the majority overturned the longstanding Azeez Basha ruling, asserting that treating legal formalities for recognition or degree conferral as grounds to nullify an institution’s minority status would constitute a breach of fundamental rights. However, Justice Chandrachud clarified that the onus rests on the concerned religious or linguistic minorities to demonstrate that the educational institution was primarily established for the benefit of their community to qualify for protection under Article 30(1). He pointed out that such an assessment of the “brain” behind an institution’s creation could be conducted through a comprehensive review of documents, correspondence and historical records.

Dismissing the Centre’s contentions, the judges further declared that recognising an institution as one of national importance does not inherently diminish its minority character, as the national and minority attributes are “not at odds with each other nor mutually exclusive.” They also refused to assign any weight to either the provision of religious instruction or the prominence of religious buildings, such as the St. Stephen’s College church or AMU mosque, in determining an institution’s minority status.

### What do the dissenting opinions state?

Justice Kant primarily differed from the majority on procedural grounds, arguing that the two-judge Bench in Anjuman-e-Rahmaniya versus District Inspector of Schools (1981), which had initially questioned the precedent set by a five-judge Bench in Azeez Basha, overstepped its jurisdiction by referring the matter directly to a seven-judge Bench. He reasoned that this undermined the Chief Justice’s authority as the “master of the roster.”

While concurring with Justice Kant on procedural impropriety, Justice Datta questioned the legitimacy of AMU’s minority status, asserting that conferring such recognition after nearly a century would amount to “historical revisionism.” Notably, he critiqued the lack of constructive discussions among the judges on the Bench, revealing that the draft opinions from Justice Chandrachud — later forming the majority judgment — were received late and underwent frequent revisions. In a likely reference to the majority ruling, Justice Datta remarked that judges should refrain from disregarding long-standing precedents in favour of judicial activism.

Justice Sharma too concluded that initial support from a minority community does not automatically grant an institution minority status, particularly if the actual control vests with the government.

### What happens next?

A regular Bench, assigned by CJI Sanjiv Khanna, will now reevaluate AMU’s minority character based on criteria set by the majority without being constrained by Azeez Basha. Meanwhile, the stay on the university’s 2005 reservation policy will persist until a final determination is made.

This reassessment is likely to have far-reaching implications for AMU’s autonomy, its authority to reserve seats for Muslim students, and the broader discourse on minority rights in India

> Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) has been at the center of a long-standing debate over its minority status. The university was founded by Muslims for the educational advancement of the Muslim community, but its minority status has been contested in legal and political arenas. A minority status would allow AMU to reserve seats for Muslim students and maintain specific administrative rights. While recent legal developments may influence its status, the issue remains complex, involving constitutional interpretations, political implications, and minority rights. Whether AMU can definitively claim this status will depend on future legal rulings and government policies.

# High prevalence of sexual violence against gay, bisexual men across six cities: study

### Violence Against Gay and Bisexual Men: Alarming Findings and Legislative Gaps

Recent research conducted by four academics has brought attention to the distressing prevalence of violence against gay and bisexual men across six Indian cities, including Delhi. The findings are concerning, revealing that a significant portion of men in the LGBTQ+ community face various forms of violence. This study coincides with legislative changes as the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) is set to replace the Indian Penal Code (IPC), prompting further scrutiny of how the new legal framework addresses—or fails to address—sexual violence against men and transgender individuals.

#### Key Findings of the Research

The study's findings indicate that violence against men who have sex with men (MSM) is not only prevalent but alarmingly widespread. In Delhi, approximately 44% of the sampled men reported experiencing sexual violence, marking it as the city with the highest recorded cases among those surveyed. The statistics across all sampled cities highlight a troubling reality: 78.7% of gay men and 44% of bisexual men reported facing some form of violence, including verbal, physical, and sexual abuse.

The research underscores the different forms of violence experienced by these men, with sexual violence being particularly concerning due to the stigma and underreporting associated with it. Verbal and physical violence often goes hand-in-hand with social ostracism, reinforcing the marginalization of the LGBTQ+ community. The persistence of such violence reflects broader societal discrimination and indicates that measures to protect these individuals are inadequate.

#### Legislative Framework: Gaps in Protection

The replacement of the Indian Penal Code with the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) has prompted discussions about the changes in legal protections offered to various communities, particularly regarding sexual violence. Under the IPC, Section 377, which criminalized consensual homosexual acts, was partially struck down by the Supreme Court in 2018, decriminalizing same-sex relations. However, the IPC did not include specific provisions for the rape of men or transgender persons.

The BNS, which seeks to modernize and streamline criminal law, unfortunately, continues this trend by not addressing sexual violence against men or transgender individuals explicitly. This omission is significant as it fails to recognize the reality that sexual violence can occur across all genders. While the IPC and the subsequent reforms have emphasized protection for women against sexual crimes, the exclusion of similar protections for men and transgender persons reflects a gap in the legislative response to violence.

#### Consequences of Legal Exclusion

The absence of a dedicated section addressing the rape of men or transgender persons in the BNS has serious implications for justice and protection. Victims of sexual violence often face substantial barriers in reporting and seeking legal redress due to the stigma attached to male-on-male sexual assault and a lack of legislative acknowledgment. This exclusion perpetuates a culture of silence, leaving many survivors without the necessary support systems or recourse to justice.

Moreover, societal perceptions contribute to the challenge. Violence against men, especially sexual violence, is often met with disbelief or minimized due to entrenched gender norms that view men as less vulnerable to such crimes. Transgender individuals face even greater challenges due to systemic discrimination, further compounded by the lack of specific legal protections.

#### Recommendations for Policy Reform

To address these gaps, comprehensive policy changes and legislative reforms are essential. Key measures include:

1. **Inclusion in the Legal Framework**: The BNS should be amended to include specific provisions for the sexual assault of men and transgender persons, ensuring these crimes are recognized and prosecuted with the same seriousness as those against women.
2. **Public Awareness and Sensitization**: Programs aimed at raising awareness about the prevalence of violence against LGBTQ+ individuals can help challenge societal norms and reduce stigma. This should be coupled with sensitivity training for law enforcement and legal professionals to improve their response to such cases.
3. **Accessible Support Services**: Establishing specialized support services, including counseling, legal aid, and medical care for survivors of violence, can help mitigate the psychological and physical toll experienced by victims.
4. **Data Collection and Research**: Continued research into the prevalence and nature of violence against LGBTQ+ individuals is crucial for shaping policies that reflect the lived realities of these communities.

#### Conclusion

The research revealing the high prevalence of violence against gay and bisexual men, particularly in cities like Delhi, underscores the urgent need for legislative reform and societal change. The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita’s failure to include provisions for the rape of men or transgender persons perpetuates a significant gap in legal protections. Addressing this gap is essential not only for providing justice to victims but also for fostering an inclusive society that upholds the rights and dignity of all its members, irrespective of gender or sexual orientation. Legislative recognition, coupled with public awareness and support services, can pave the way for meaningful change and greater safety for the LGBTQ+ community.

> Research highlights high levels of violence against gay and bisexual men in six Indian cities, with Delhi showing 44% of respondents experiencing sexual violence. The study found 78.7% of gay men and 44% of bisexual men faced verbal, physical, or sexual violence. This comes as the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) is set to replace the Indian Penal Code (IPC), lacking provisions for the rape of men or transgender individuals. This legislative gap leaves these groups without adequate legal protection or recourse. Addressing this issue requires amending laws, increasing awareness, training law enforcement, and ensuring access to support services for victims.

# Ending discrimination in prisons

On October 3, the Supreme Court in Sukanya Shantha v. Union of India (2024) reaffirmed the principle of non-discrimination in Indian prisons. The rules in jail manuals segregating prisoners based on caste was at the heart of this challenge. They were struck down for perpetuating caste discrimination and violating the fundamental rights of prisoners. Previously too, courts have often set aside prison rules that classified prisoners and treated them differently. Where the basis was either irrational, arbitrary, or a prohibited ground, it could not withstand the scrutiny of the equality code under Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution.

### No arbitrary segregation

A distinction based on social status of prisoners was dealt with by the Supreme Court in Prem Shankar Shukla v. Delhi Administration (1980). The Punjab Police Rules distinguished under-trial prisoners as ‘better class’ and ‘ordinary’. Only the ‘better class’ were exempted from wearing handcuffs. The Court reasoned that it was completely irrational for the state to assume that an indigent prisoner was more dangerous to the society than an affluent one. Economic and social considerations could not be the basis for classifying prisoners for the purposes of handcuffs. The provisions were held to be unconstitutional.

The Bombay High Court in Inacio Manuel Miranda v. State (1988) was faced with a different type of segregation affecting the prisoners’ right to write in prison. The Goa, Daman and Diu Prisoners Rules treated prisoners differently for writing welfare letters. ‘Class-I prisoners’ could write four letters per month, but ‘Class-II prisoners’ could only write two. This was held unreasonable and discriminatory, affecting the convict’s right to be treated equally in their freedom of expression. The Court followed its previous decision in Madhukar Bhagwan Jambhale v. State of Maharashtra (1984) where a prohibition on writing letters to co-prisoners, imposed by the Maharashtra Prison Rules, was struck down as having no logical basis and unduly inhibiting the prisoners’ constitutional rights.

A principle that resonated with the Court was that the prison itself could not strip the prisoners of rights they would otherwise be entitled to. Non-discrimination was one such right. The most recent decision of the Supreme Court in Sukanya Shantha brought about the starkest case of prison segregation. Here, caste hierarchy was the basis of classification for labour inside prisons. This meant that only prisoners of certain ‘marginalised castes’ were given cleaning and sweeping jobs, and others were given jobs like cooking. The State Prison Rules stated that these castes were “accustomed to performing such duties”. This classification had no connection with the individual ability or qualification of the prisoner and did not aid reformation. It perpetuated caste identity and prevented an equal opportunity to reform. The State Prison Rules and similar executive decisions were therefore set aside as discriminatory under Articles 14 and 15, with directions to the States to undertake amends.

### The way forward

In another case, three petitions came before the Calcutta High Court, which were decided together in August 2012 (Gaur Narayan Chakraborty and Others). The main issue before the Court was whether Maoists who were waging a war against the state using arms, and who were charged under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, and other special statutes, could be treated as political prisoners. The trial court had rejected this demand of the petitioners in accordance with the West Bengal Correctional Services (WBCS) Act, 1992, on the premise that they were members of a banned terrorist organisation, and their activities were not for the common good of the people, but for the revolution with arms.

However, the High Court, after discussing municipal and international viewpoints on the political offences and interpreting the WBCS Act on the classification of prisoners, reached the conclusion that “the believers of any kind of political movement are to be acknowledged as political prisoners and thus, it cannot be held that those who participate in unlawful activities cannot be recognised as political prisoners”.

Though the Supreme Court did not have occasion to decide the special leave petition arising from this decision on merit, the Calcutta High Court’s judgment is significant for highlighting a similar right of prisoners to be treated in a dignified manner.

The High Court noticed that a person classified as a political prisoner is entitled to a few amenities, such as a chair, table, light, iron cot, mattress, pillow, blanket, and mirror. He is entitled to cooking, services of a barber, writing material, and a newspaper, and is also permitted to receive books from his relatives. These facilities are a part of the basic human rights to which every prisoner ought to be entitled. The Court said these amenities should not be restricted to political prisoners. It suggested that the state administration re-look into the classification of prisoners and provide basic amenities to all. A slight improvement in the living conditions of prisoners in itself would erode the classification which the WBCS Act acknowledges.

While the Supreme Court’s recent judgment did away with caste discrimination inside prisons, incorporating basic amenities in prisons by suitably amending the Model Prison Manual 2016 will not only blur other distinctions, but will also ensure a minimum dignified life inside prisons.

> Ending discrimination in prisons involves addressing systemic biases and ensuring equal treatment for all inmates, regardless of race, gender, religion, or background. Key measures include implementing anti-discrimination policies, training prison staff on cultural competency, and establishing clear oversight to prevent abuse and favoritism. Programs focused on rehabilitation should be equally accessible, ensuring fair opportunities for education, work, and mental health support. Transparent complaint mechanisms and regular monitoring by independent bodies are crucial for accountability. Such reforms foster a fairer prison environment, reduce recidivism, and promote respect for human rights, contributing to more equitable and effective correctional systems.

# Giving shape to India’s carbon credit mechanism

### Carbon Credit Mechanism Explained

The carbon credit mechanism is a market-based tool designed to incentivize the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by assigning a monetary value to carbon savings. This system allows countries, companies, or organizations that emit less than their designated carbon allowance to sell their excess allowances as credits to those exceeding their limits. Understanding how this mechanism functions and its implications is vital for its successful application in climate strategies.

#### Basics of the Carbon Credit System

1. **What is a Carbon Credit?**
   A carbon credit represents the right to emit one metric ton of carbon dioxide (CO2) or its equivalent in other GHGs. These credits can be generated through projects that reduce or remove emissions from the atmosphere, such as reforestation initiatives, renewable energy projects, or energy efficiency improvements.

2. **Types of Carbon Credit Markets**:
   - **Compliance Market**: This market is regulated and based on mandatory carbon caps set by governments or international agreements, such as the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). Entities that exceed their carbon emission limits must purchase credits to offset their excess emissions.
   - **Voluntary Market**: This is driven by companies or individuals who choose to offset their carbon footprint voluntarily. These credits are often certified by independent organizations and are popular for businesses looking to demonstrate environmental responsibility.

#### How Carbon Credit Mechanisms Work

The carbon credit mechanism is fundamentally about balancing emissions through trade. Here's a simplified outline of how it operates:

1. **Cap and Trade System**: A governing body sets a cap on the total amount of emissions allowed. This cap is divided into allowances or credits, distributed among participating entities (e.g., industries). Companies that reduce emissions below their allotted amount can sell their surplus credits to others that are unable to meet their limits.
2. **Emission Reduction Projects**: Projects that actively reduce carbon emissions, such as wind farms, solar installations, or methane capture in landfills, can generate carbon credits. These projects are verified by certifying bodies to ensure they achieve real, measurable, and additional emission reductions.
3. **Trading and Pricing**: Carbon credits are traded on carbon exchanges. The price of a carbon credit is influenced by supply and demand, regulatory policies, and market perception of climate risks. A high price typically motivates companies to invest in cleaner technologies, while a low price may reduce the incentive to cut emissions.

#### Benefits of the Carbon Credit Mechanism

1. **Incentivizes Emission Reductions**: By assigning a financial value to emission reductions, carbon credits encourage industries to adopt greener practices. Companies that reduce emissions can benefit financially by selling their surplus credits, while those exceeding their caps are economically driven to limit their carbon output.

2. **Promotes Innovation**: The prospect of earning revenue through carbon credits stimulates research and development in cleaner technologies and renewable energy sources. This market-based approach supports the transition towards sustainable practices and low-carbon development.

3. **Supports Developing Nations**: Carbon credit mechanisms can also provide funding for sustainable development projects in developing countries. These nations can sell carbon credits generated from projects that reduce emissions, such as forest conservation or renewable energy infrastructure, to developed countries seeking to offset their carbon footprint.

#### Challenges and Considerations

For a carbon market to be effective, it needs a robust design. India’s establishment of a domestic carbon market under the Energy Conservation (Amendment) Act of 2022 aims to address some of these challenges:

1. **Ensuring Credibility and Transparency**:
   - **Verification and Monitoring**: A strong framework for monitoring and verification is crucial. Without it, carbon markets risk being flooded with non-credible credits, undermining trust and effectiveness. Projects must meet rigorous standards to ensure emissions reductions are legitimate.
   - **Prevention of Double Counting**: It is essential that the same carbon credit is not claimed by more than one entity. Clear accounting rules help maintain integrity and transparency in the market.

2. **Balancing Efficiency and Fairness**:
   - **Addressing Market Inequities**: Developed countries often have a greater capacity to invest in emissions reduction technologies. A fair carbon market must account for these disparities to ensure developing nations are not disadvantaged. This can include support mechanisms like technology transfer and capacity-building initiatives.
   - **Avoiding Market Manipulation**: Measures must be in place to prevent market manipulation and ensure that the trading system remains accessible and fair to all participants. 

#### Lessons from Global Experiences

India can draw on lessons from global carbon markets:
1. **Stringent Oversight**: The EU ETS, while successful, faced initial challenges due to overallocation of permits and price volatility. India must ensure that the cap is set appropriately, and trading rules are well-enforced.
2. **Broad Participation**: Markets thrive on diversity. India’s carbon market should include a range of sectors, from heavy industries to agriculture and renewable projects, to create a vibrant and balanced marketplace.

#### Conclusion

India’s move to establish a Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS) aligns with its climate goals and the global push towards sustainability. For this system to effectively contribute to emissions reduction, the framework must be transparent, credible, and equitable. By incorporating lessons from global markets and prioritizing both environmental and economic objectives, India can design a carbon market that supports its commitment to the Paris Agreement and promotes long-term, sustainable growth.

> The carbon credit mechanism assigns a financial value to reducing emissions, enabling entities to buy and sell credits representing one metric ton of CO2. It operates through compliance and voluntary markets, encouraging emission cuts and innovation while supporting sustainable projects, especially in developing countries. India, through the Energy Conservation (Amendment) Act of 2022, aims to establish a domestic carbon market aligned with its Paris Agreement goals. Challenges include ensuring credibility, preventing double counting, and avoiding market manipulation. Drawing from global experiences like the EU ETS, India needs robust oversight and a broad, inclusive market design to achieve long-term climate success.

# The LAC agreement, the détentes and the questions

### India-China Détente: Potential for Renewed Relations

The recent India-China détente marked by the summit on the sidelines of the 16th BRICS Summit in Kazan, held on October 23, 2024, signifies a possible turning point in the bilateral relationship between the two Asian giants. The meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping, followed by a symbolic exchange of sweets between soldiers at the Line of Actual Control (LAC), suggests both sides’ willingness to ease tensions that have persisted since the Galwan Valley clash in 2020. If this détente is genuine and sustainable, there are several critical areas where progress is needed to restore stability and foster mutual growth.

#### Rebuilding Trust at the Border

The exchange of sweets at the LAC is more than just a ceremonial gesture; it symbolizes an intention to foster goodwill and mend frayed relations. However, translating gestures into sustained peace requires robust action. Both nations need to prioritize mechanisms that ensure transparency and communication along the border. Confidence-building measures, such as enhanced dialogue between military commanders and joint patrolling agreements, could be steps forward in preventing miscalculations that could escalate into conflict.

The disengagement of troops and a clearer delineation of the LAC remain key to rebuilding trust. The Indian government will be cautious, given past breaches of agreements by the Chinese side. Therefore, diplomatic engagements should aim at setting clear terms for maintaining peace, ideally monitored by third-party oversight to guarantee accountability and trust.

#### Economic Implications and Cooperation

Restoring economic ties is another critical area for discussion. The past few years saw India imposing restrictions on Chinese investments and tightening scrutiny on imports. These measures, while aimed at protecting national security, also affected sectors reliant on Chinese raw materials and technology. For China, the downturn in trade relations with India, one of its major markets, had implications amid its broader economic challenges.

Reversing economic restrictions, if approached carefully, could reinvigorate trade and boost both economies. Allowing more investments, especially in non-strategic sectors, and resuming direct flights could lead to increased business engagements and people-to-people contact. For India, the opportunity to access Chinese capital, technology, and infrastructure expertise could be beneficial for its growth trajectory. Simultaneously, India must strengthen frameworks that ensure critical infrastructure and sensitive sectors remain safeguarded from undue influence.

#### Reviving Diplomatic and Cultural Exchanges

The easing of tensions opens the door for greater interaction beyond trade. Issuing more visas, especially for students, researchers, and business professionals, can build cultural and academic bridges that are essential for long-term understanding. Educational and cultural exchanges can help dispel the mutual mistrust prevalent in the public perception of both nations.

Moreover, restoring direct flights would facilitate travel, tourism, and international collaborations, helping to rebuild the connection that was significantly affected during the COVID-19 pandemic. This would signal a broader commitment to normalization and foster deeper ties at a people-to-people level.

#### Challenges to Sustained Peace

Despite these potential areas for cooperation, challenges remain. The longstanding border dispute, nationalistic pressures in both countries, and global geopolitical alignments—particularly involving the U.S., Russia, and other BRICS members—could complicate sustained peace. India, wary of China’s regional ambitions, would seek assurances that engagements do not come at the cost of its strategic autonomy or security interests. On the other hand, China would likely aim to secure economic footholds and influence in India’s vast market as it navigates an increasingly complex global economy.

The domestic political climates in both countries will also play a crucial role. In India, where national security is a significant public and political issue, any perceived compromise on the border dispute could be met with skepticism. Similarly, China’s leadership will need to balance outward reconciliation with its assertive policies at home and abroad.

#### Conclusion

The recent summit between Prime Minister Modi and President Xi Jinping signals a possible easing of tensions that have marked the India-China relationship for over four years. While symbolic gestures like the exchange of sweets at the LAC reflect a willingness to move forward, substantial actions are needed to restore trust, rebuild economic ties, and revive cultural exchanges. The road to lasting peace will require clear commitments, strategic compromises, and mutual respect. For both nations, the potential benefits of such a détente are significant, encompassing enhanced economic growth, regional stability, and a stronger voice on the global stage. However, navigating these possibilities demands careful, balanced diplomacy to manage challenges and sustain momentum.

> The recent India-China détente, highlighted by a summit between Prime Minister Modi and President Xi Jinping during the 16th BRICS Summit, suggests a move towards easing tensions after years of strained relations. The symbolic exchange of sweets between soldiers at the LAC hints at potential peace efforts. Priorities include building trust through border transparency, boosting economic ties by easing trade and investment restrictions, and resuming direct flights and visas to enhance people-to-people interactions. Challenges remain, such as ensuring border security, managing nationalistic pressures, and navigating geopolitical influences. Sustained peace will require strategic diplomacy, mutual respect, and cautious policy implementation.

### Caste Survey in Telangana: Pros and Cons

The caste survey initiated in Telangana by the Congress government is a landmark move that aims to address social equity, particularly in educational and employment opportunities for the Backward Classes (BCs). This survey aligns with the party’s 2023 Assembly poll promise and has sparked discussions about its potential impact on the state’s socio-economic landscape. Understanding the potential benefits and challenges is essential for evaluating the long-term implications of this policy.

#### Pros of the Caste Survey

1. **Informed Policy Decisions**:
   One of the primary advantages of conducting a caste survey is that it equips the government with accurate data about the socio-economic status of various communities. This information can guide targeted policy-making and ensure that affirmative action policies are more effective and evidence-based. Accurate data will help identify which sub-groups within the broader BC categories require more support, allowing for tailored programs that address their specific needs.

2. **Equitable Resource Allocation**:
   With comprehensive data, the government can allocate resources more equitably among different communities. The current reservation of 29% for BCs, which includes 4% for socially and educationally disadvantaged Muslim BCs, could be revised based on the survey’s findings. This ensures that quotas and affirmative action measures are proportional to the actual population distribution and needs of these groups.

3. **Social Inclusion**:
   The survey can promote a sense of inclusion among marginalized groups by acknowledging their presence and unique challenges. This can empower communities that feel overlooked by current policies, enhancing their confidence in the state’s commitment to their well-being. Recognizing the diversity within the BC category can help dismantle the “one-size-fits-all” approach and create more inclusive policies.

4. **Political and Social Justice**:
   By potentially expanding the reservation system based on survey results, the state can work towards rectifying historical injustices and fostering a more balanced representation of disadvantaged groups in education and employment. This aligns with the broader goals of social justice, which seek to bridge the gap between privileged and marginalized communities.

#### Cons of the Caste Survey

1. **Potential for Political Polarization**:
   Caste-based surveys can inadvertently deepen existing social divides and fuel political polarization. While the intention is to collect data for policy enhancement, such surveys can also be perceived as tools for vote-bank politics. This perception may result in backlash from groups that feel sidelined or unfairly treated by potential changes in reservation policies.

2. **Risk of Over-Representation**:
   If the survey results lead to an increase in reservations, some critics argue that it could create an imbalance where merit-based opportunities shrink, impacting individuals from non-reserved categories. The challenge lies in maintaining a balance where opportunities are distributed fairly without alienating any section of the population.

3. **Administrative and Implementation Challenges**:
   Conducting a survey of this magnitude requires significant logistical and financial resources. The process must be thorough, impartial, and free of errors to ensure credibility. Any flaws or biases in data collection could lead to disputes and erode trust in the outcomes. Furthermore, implementing policy changes based on the findings would require a meticulous approach to avoid operational challenges and potential legal hurdles.

4. **Social Tensions**:
   There is a risk that identifying and publicizing detailed data on various castes could exacerbate social tensions. Communities may develop a competitive mindset, vying for a larger share of government benefits. Such competition can lead to friction between groups and potentially disturb social harmony.

5. **Impact on Meritocracy**:
   Critics often point out that while reservation policies aim to create equal opportunities, an excessive emphasis on quota systems can undermine the principle of meritocracy. This concern is particularly relevant in professional education and competitive job markets, where skills and qualifications are vital for success.

#### Long-term Implications and the Path Forward

The launch of the caste survey in Telangana signals a strong intent to reassess and potentially expand affirmative action policies to better serve the state’s diverse population. While the move promises more inclusive and data-driven policymaking, it also comes with significant challenges. To ensure that the survey results lead to positive outcomes, the government must adopt a transparent, unbiased approach to data collection and subsequent policy implementation.

Engaging with all stakeholders, including community leaders and experts in socio-economic policy, will be crucial to avoid any unintended consequences. Clear communication about the goals and benefits of the survey can help alleviate fears and misconceptions among the public. Balancing the need for social equity with the principles of fairness and meritocracy will be a delicate but essential task for the Telangana government.

> The Telangana government's caste survey aims to gather comprehensive data to guide policy decisions and potentially adjust reservation quotas for Backward Classes (BCs), fulfilling an election promise. Benefits include informed policymaking, equitable resource allocation, and promoting social inclusion. However, challenges include risks of political polarization, over-representation, administrative hurdles, potential social tensions, and concerns about undermining meritocracy. For the survey's success, transparent data collection and balanced policy implementation are essential. Engaging stakeholders and clear communication will help address fears, ensuring social equity without compromising fairness or social harmony. The government must carefully navigate these aspects for positive, lasting impacts.
