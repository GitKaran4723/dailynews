# Can India get rich before growing old?

There has been a lot of hype about India’s demographic dividend, ever since liberalisation unlocked possibilities beyond the reach of our once socialist, more austere imagination. Demographic dividend denotes a country’s economic growth advantages when most of its population is in the working-age bracket. Today, the dividend has become this vague, almost mythical assurance of perpetual economic growth. Unfortunately, as often happens with things that are, or assumed to be, perpetual, we take them for granted. This perhaps explains why we end up resenting the ‘extra’ number of people vying for education, employment, and housing. Politicians then give expression to this resentment by trying to reserve jobs for locals.

### The middle-income trap

A reality check is in order. Even though three-fourths of India’s population is aged 15-64, the dividend, as it turns out, is not the silver bullet that we have held it out to be, nor is it perpetual. India’s total fertility rate (TFR) — the average number of children a woman has in her lifetime — is declining at a faster pace than was anticipated a decade ago. Projections suggest that within 10 years, the proportion of working-age individuals in the total population will begin to fall, marking the beginning of the end of India’s demographic dividend. Most States are now below the replacement-level fertility rate of 2.1 children per woman, needed to maintain a stable population. Southern States such as Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, with TFRs below 1.75, are leading this trend. Other States, including Punjab and West Bengal, are also experiencing similar declines, indicating that this is a nationwide phenomenon.

India’s rapid decline in TFR also challenges conventional wisdom, which links lower birth rates to improvements in education and income. Despite modest gains in per capita income, which still places India among lower-middle-income countries, the country’s TFR has dropped from 2.6 in 2010 to 1.99 today. As India approaches middle-income status by the next decade, this decline is expected to accelerate. Whether India can get rich before it grows old is no longer just an alarmist concern; it has become an existential dread.

What is even more worrying is that our dividend is right now being wasted as people remain stuck in low-productivity agricultural jobs or remain unemployed while preparing for competitive exams. Since liberalisation, India has reduced the proportion of its workforce in low productivity agriculture by a mere 17 percentage points, from 63% to 46%; for comparison, 30 years after China’s liberalisation, the country’s share of workers in agriculture reduced by 32 points, from 70% to 38%. Meanwhile, India’s labour force participation rate (LFPR) in urban areas remains at a dismal 50%. If India continues on this path, it risks falling into a middle-income trap from which only a handful of countries have escaped. Even China, after years of rapid growth, is slowing down. India must not assume it will fare any better, especially as its demographic window narrows.

### Focus on manufacturing

So, what must we do to leverage the demographic dividend before it is too late? Throughout history, the proven path for economic growth has been the movement of workers from low-productivity sectors such as agriculture to higher-productivity jobs in manufacturing and services. While the services sector has grown significantly, manufacturing has stagnated in India. This needs to be addressed, because manufacturing, particularly in labour-intensive industries, creates far more jobs than services. For example, the textile and apparel industry, worth $150 billion, employs 45 million people, compared to 5.5 million in the $250 billion IT-BPM sector. Moreover, textile factories often employ 60-70% women, empowering those who might otherwise be confined to unpaid work (only three out of 10 working-age Indian women are in the labour force).

Manufacturers in India face significant challenges. According to recent World Bank surveys, one in six manufacturers cites business licensing and permits as major constraints, compared to less than 3% in Vietnam. Similarly, access to land and cumbersome customs and trade regulations are major hurdles, with 17% of manufacturers facing such issues, compared to 3% in Vietnam. These barriers are stifling manufacturing growth. Thus, India must improve its business environment, which is crucial for enabling large-scale job creation.

The Central government should lower tariffs to make inputs cheaper for Indian manufacturers and boost exports. Finalising long-pending free trade agreements with the U.K. and EU should be another priority to expand market access for Indian products. State governments should be bolder with labour reforms, allowing workers to choose flexible work arrangements, and also look into land and building regulations for factories. As per a recent report by Prosperiti, many factories can only use half their land due to restrictive building standards, which increases manufacturing costs. Additionally, restrictions on creating worker housing in industrial zones raise hiring costs. Addressing these issues and improving the investment climate must be India’s priorities.

We must strive to capitalise on our demographic dividend. With a similar per capita income to India in the 1980s, China transitioned millions from agriculture to manufacturing. It is time India stops patting itself on the back for the short-lived blessing that is its ‘demographic dividend’ and gets to work on leveraging it.

India faces a crucial demographic challenge: leveraging its youthful population to achieve economic prosperity before the aging process sets in and reduces the working-age proportion of the population. The concept of "getting rich before growing old" requires strategic planning and policy implementation to maximize productivity and economic output while the population is still predominantly young.

### Current Demographic Landscape

India's demographic advantage lies in its large, young population, with over half of its citizens below the age of 30. This demographic dividend offers a unique opportunity for accelerated economic growth, provided that it is effectively harnessed. However, if not managed well, it can turn into a demographic burden as the population ages, resulting in increased economic pressure from social security and healthcare costs without significant gains in prosperity.

### Strategies for Achieving Economic Prosperity

1. **Investing in Education and Skill Development**:
   A critical step is enhancing the quality of education and vocational training to align with the needs of a modern economy. Focused investments in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics), technical skills, and digital literacy can prepare the workforce for higher-value jobs. Skill development initiatives should also include retraining and upskilling to ensure that workers remain relevant in the changing job landscape.

2. **Boosting Job Creation**:
   The creation of jobs, especially in manufacturing, services, and technology sectors, is essential for absorbing the workforce. Policies that attract domestic and foreign investment, ease of doing business reforms, and incentives for startups can foster job growth. Special Economic Zones (SEZs) and industrial corridors can be leveraged to boost manufacturing and related industries.

3. **Strengthening Infrastructure**:
   Robust infrastructure is the backbone of economic growth. Expanding transportation, energy, and digital infrastructure can improve productivity and reduce the cost of doing business. Investments in smart cities, efficient public transport, and sustainable energy sources will not only create jobs but also make Indian cities more livable and business-friendly.

4. **Enhancing Healthcare and Social Security**:
   To ensure a healthy and productive workforce, investment in public health is essential. Better healthcare systems reduce the economic burden of diseases and increase overall productivity. Comprehensive social security systems, including pension reforms, will be necessary as the population ages, ensuring that India’s elderly do not become an economic liability.

5. **Empowering Women and Reducing Inequality**:
   Boosting female labor force participation can significantly impact economic growth. Policies that support women’s education, safety, and workplace inclusion are crucial. Additionally, reducing economic inequality through targeted social programs can create a more balanced and sustainable economic model.

### Conclusion

India’s ability to "get rich before growing old" hinges on decisive action across multiple fronts. By investing in education, job creation, infrastructure, healthcare, and social policies, India can harness its demographic dividend to achieve sustainable economic growth. The key lies in proactive governance and policies that anticipate future challenges and convert current opportunities into long-term prosperity.

> India's challenge is to leverage its young population for economic growth before the demographic shift towards an older population. To achieve prosperity, India must invest in quality education and skill development to prepare the workforce for higher-value jobs. Job creation through manufacturing, services, and technology sectors is essential, supported by reforms and investment incentives. Robust infrastructure development, enhanced healthcare, and comprehensive social security will ensure a productive workforce and economic stability. Empowering women and reducing inequality will further boost economic growth. Proactive policies and governance are crucial to turn India’s demographic advantage into sustainable long-term prosperity.

# Calling out exploitative labour dynamics on platforms

In the midst of the continuous evolution of the concept of “gig workers”, there was a groundbreaking movement in India recently — a nationwide digital strike this Deepavali that was organised by women gig workers. This was a call made by the Gig and Platform Services Workers Union (GIPSWU), India’s first union that is dedicated primarily to women gig workers. The strike sought gig worker and service user solidarity across the country and the world on the issue of exploitative and abusive labour practices.

A case of exploitation

An online search reveals the extent to which platform companies have been offering countless discounted offers during this festive season. But where do these discounts originate from? Gig workers want to make this clear — they come at the expense of their wages and are a result of near-slavery-like working conditions.

But do consumers or the government care about this? Instead, the manufactured narrative seems to be on how young people are finding employment through these “unicorn” startups. Why are we not questioning how these startups achieve such rapid growth? The truth is that the expansion of platform startups is being fuelled by the exploitation of platform-based gig workers and venture capital firms that are keen to supply money endlessly with no requirement of a sustainable profit model.

Readers must be aware of a controversial piece of conversation in October this year between the CEO of one of the largest platform companies and a stand-up comic and satirist. The satirist had highlighted deficiencies in the company’s products and services on social media and had challenged the CEO to take responsibility. But the satirist faced bullying instead. Prominent figures, which included a senior journalist, called the satirist a traitor while praising the CEO as a “nation’s wealth creator”. But is the CEO of this well-known platform really a wealth creator? Or is he profiting from the exploitation of gig workers? And how do we see the role of gig workers? Are they not also contributing to nation building by providing cheap labour? Why cannot we consider ‘labour exploitation’ to be an anti- national act? It is a fact that informal economy workers contribute over 60% of India’s GDP.

For the writers of this article, this moment is pivotal — women gig workers chose the auspicious day of Deepavali to initiate a digital strike, calling it a “Black Diwali”. The response was overwhelming, with media coverage, and support from gig workers and citizen’s forums. However, women workers are aware that this is a long battle as their demands are missing from mainstream labour discourse. They advocate having secure and dignified employment and stricter regulations on platform companies. Governments and larger gig worker organisations seem to focus only on minimal social security measures which are often just a little more than repackaged charity schemes than actual constitutional entitlements. It is essential to remember that workers have fought for over a century for appropriate working hours, safe conditions, living wages, and secure employment norms.

One-sided ‘auto-assigned’ jobs

Digital platforms have perpetuated age-old patriarchal structures, limiting women to jobs that have been historically designated — beauticians, cooks, and housekeepers. Job security for women often hinges on ratings and the acceptance of “auto-assigned” jobs. If they refuse these exploitative norms, they face being blocked or, in effect, “illegally terminated”. This creates a dystopian reality wherein individuals are constantly rated and reduced to being mere numbers.

Many GIPSWU members are divorced, single mothers, or survivors of domestic violence, seeking refuge in platform jobs due to a lack of employment alternatives. Companies are aware and cash in on the fact that this is a pool of cheap labour that will remain available, making unionisation ineffective against their profit-driven models. They exploit labour laws while employing incomprehensible Artificial Intelligence-driven algorithms to manage workers.

Under the guise of offering “freedom” to choose working hours and attain financial independence, gig economy platforms entice women with promises of balancing work and family commitments. However, this ‘autonomy’ has a hidden side to it. Women often feel pressured to meet unrealistic targets while juggling the demands of gig work. In return for a misleading sense of control over their schedules, they face heavy financial burdens, including transportation costs, necessary service products, and platform fees. This is a system that fails to provide equitable returns, leaving many without essential earnings or social security benefits.

This is bizarre. The state lacks systems to prevent companies from having anti-labour practices, and in the absence of data privacy laws, allows these platform giants to thrive while perpetuating a rudimentary feminisation of labour. This deeply embedded patriarchal structure hinders women workers in India from having basic human and labour rights. It is a matter of shame that so many women are struggling when there are campaigns at the national level with slogans such as “Beti Bachao Beti Padhao”.

Women have yet to escape the cycle of exploitation that many unicorn startups resort to in their claims to be fostering economic empowerment and addressing India’s unemployment crisis. The reality is that women have fallen into a more complex cycle of exploitation — one where conventional patriarchy merges with digital patriarchy, leading to profound economic exploitation.

Grassroot power

GIPSWU must pursue a long-term agenda with a nuanced strategy. This digital strike has bolstered worker confidence and has shown pathways that will lead to victories. The writers have been told that no such assertion of dissent has been seen anywhere else in the world before and that it is a proud moment. There is no substitute for grass-roots organising, and we understand its power. It is only which can help us conduct negotiations for suitable policies and laws in the future. Gig workers around the world are watching, and we will not let them down.

> Exploitative labor practices on digital platforms have raised significant concerns, as workers often face poor pay, unstable conditions, and lack of benefits or protections. These platforms can bypass traditional labor laws, leading to unfair treatment and economic insecurity for gig and freelance workers. Calling out such dynamics is essential for promoting better regulations, fair compensation, and safeguards that ensure workers’ rights. Addressing this requires a collaborative effort among governments, companies, and advocacy groups to create policies that balance platform flexibility with workers' well-being. Transparent practices and worker representation are crucial to fostering equitable labor standards in the digital economy.

# States and the Centre’s fetter of ‘net borrowing ceiling’

The central government, in 2023, imposed a **‘Net Borrowing Ceiling’ (NBC)** on the State of Kerala to restrict the maximum possible borrowing that the State can make under the law. This ceiling is 3% of the projected Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) for FY2023-24. The NBC now encompasses all borrowing avenues, including open market loans, financial institution loans, and liabilities from the public account of the State. Furthermore, to stop States from circumventing the borrowing cap through State-owned enterprises, the ceiling has been extended to cover certain borrowings by these entities as well.

This has been a huge blow to the financial position of the State, with Kerala finding it difficult to meet its expenditure. In addition, this has restrained the State from investing further in developmental and welfare activities. It has also ignited political and legal controversies which have created an incompatible situation between the Centre and the State. Kerala approached the Supreme Court of India on the issue of the encroachment on the executive power that is conferred on the State under Article 293 of the Constitution of India to borrow on the security and guarantee of the Consolidated Fund. The State has alleged that the State’s fiscal autonomy, as guaranteed and enshrined in the Constitution of India, has been illegally curtailed by the Centre. This has been the first case in the history of the Court wherein Article 293 has come up for interpretation.

### Borrowing powers and provisions

Chapter II of Part XII of the Constitution deals with the borrowing powers of the Centre and States. Article 292 speaks about the borrowing power of the central government which entitles the central government to borrow loans upon the security of the Consolidated Fund of India. Article 293 empowers the State government to borrow within the territory of India upon the security of the consolidated fund of the State. In both cases, the extent of borrowing may be fixed from time to time by a law enacted by Parliament and the State legislature, respectively. As in Article 293(2), the Government of India may grant loans to any State subject to conditions laid down by any law made by Parliament up to the limits fixed under Article 292.

The central government can also provide guarantees upon the Consolidated Fund of India in respect of loans raised by any State. Article 293(3) imposes a restriction on the State government if the repayment of loans or a guarantee which has been given by the Government of India (if taken by the predecessor government is still outstanding). In such a case, the consent of the central government is essential to raise such a loan. The central government is afforded broad discretion over “consent” by specifying that it may be granted subject to any conditions as the Government of India deems appropriate.

Article 293 of the Constitution is adopted from Section 163 of the Government of India Act, 1935. In the Constituent Assembly, while Article 293 (draft Article 269) was debated on August 10, 1949, a member, Ananthasayanam Ayyangar, noted that the issue of borrowings and loans requires greater scrutiny as borrowing imposes heavy obligations on not only the present generation but also future generations. He suggested that a commission akin to the Finance Commission may be constituted.

Section 163(4) of the Government of India Act, 1935 stated that while exercising the power conferred under Section 163(3) regarding ‘consent’, the Federation shall not refuse or make unreasonable delay in granting the loan or providing guarantee, or impose any unreasonable conditions when sufficient cause is shown by the provinces. If any dispute arises out of the matter stated it was to be referred to the Governor-General whose decision shall be final.

But this clause was not adopted into the Constitution. The reason was that this provision was included in the Government of India Act, 1935 as it expected that a different agency that was not a national of India would be in charge of the administration. But after the Independence, it was felt that such a provision was not necessary as State governments replaced the provinces and a national government was established at the Centre.

### Eliminating revenue shortfall

To implement the mandates in Article 292, the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, 2003 was enacted to maintain financial restraint by establishing goals such as the elimination of revenue shortfall and the reduction of fiscal deficit. To eliminate the revenue shortfall and the budgetary deficit, a target of 3% of GDP is established for the Centre’s yearly fiscal deficit ratio (FD). As in the Centre’s directives, States enacted their own pieces of legislation to control their fiscal deficit. The FRBM Amendment Act, 2018 required the central government to ensure that the fiscal deficit did not surpass 3% of GDP and that the total public debt did not surpass 60% of GDP. By 2025–26, the government expects to reduce the fiscal deficit to less than 4.5% of GDP. The Centre’s restriction on the borrowing limits of the States so as to attain fiscal consolidation by restricting the fiscal deficit, and without considering the financial position of States, is an encroachment of the autonomy of States. It also lowers their ability at budget balancing.

The issue of the borrowing power of States guaranteed under Article 293 of the Constitution is before the Supreme Court in the case filed by the State of Kerala. As the interpretation of Article 293 of the Constitution of India raises key questions about fiscal decentralisation, State fiscal autonomy and past borrowing practices, the Court has referred the issue of a State’s borrowing powers to a Constitutional Bench. The matter also touches on whether the fiscal regulations imposed by the Centre have negatively impacted the Reserve Bank of India’s control over fiscal consolidation.

Contemplating the transforming economic, political, and fiscal landscape in India, it is time to revisit Article 293 of the Constitution. Section 163(4) of the Government of India Act, 1935 warns the unnecessary refusal or delaying or the imposing of conditions in granting loans by the Centre. Similarly, a remedial measure, as mentioned in Section 163(4), could have been adopted in the Constitution when a dispute arises.

### There is a need to strengthen this Article

Article 293 of the Constitution must be strengthened in the following manner.

As suggested by Ananthasayanam Ayyangar, a commission akin to the Finance Commission is essential to decide any issues that may arise regarding the approval of a loan upon considering the financial position of States as well as the Centre’s goal of limiting fiscal deficit.

There must be proper guidelines which are to be adhered to when the Centre exercises the wide powers granted under Article 293(4) of the Indian Constitution — crucial in maintaining a balanced fiscal framework between the Centre and the States, and which enhance cooperative federalism. Otherwise, there could be arbitrary decision-making that may disrupt fiscal discipline, leading to either unchecked borrowing or overly restrictive conditions.

When exercising the wide powers granted under Article 293(4), the Centre should adhere to the following guidelines: transparency in decision-making thereby ensuring that the procedures and standards for accepting or rejecting governmental borrowings are transparent to the public; having a consultative process, where there is consultation with State governments before prescribing any terms or limitations on borrowing which enhances cooperative approach; ensuring equitable treatment where there an employment of borrowing terms and restrictions applied uniformly for all States to eliminate prejudice or favouritism; an admiration for fiscal autonomy, ensuring that there is financial autonomy for a State, the restrictions are reasonable and do not unduly hamper a State’s ability to manage its finances effectively.

Adhering to these guidelines can ensure that the Centre’s powers under Article 293(4) are exercised fairly, transparently and in a manner that supports balanced fiscal management and cooperative federalism.

> In 2023, the central government imposed a 3% Net Borrowing Ceiling (NBC) on Kerala’s GSDP, restricting the state’s borrowing capacity and including borrowings by State-owned enterprises. This has strained Kerala’s finances, impacting its ability to fund welfare and development projects. The state argues that this cap violates Article 293 of the Constitution, which grants states the power to borrow with legislative approval. Kerala has taken the issue to the Supreme Court, marking the first interpretation of Article 293. The case raises significant questions about fiscal federalism, state autonomy, and the balance of power between the Centre and state governments.

# Kerala mulls action against IAS officer for social media group

The Kerala government's contemplation of action against an IAS officer for involvement in a social media group raises significant questions about the ethical conduct, impartiality, and public responsibilities of civil servants in India. The role of IAS officers, bound by strict codes of conduct and ethical principles, is critical for maintaining trust in the public administration. Examining the potential implications of this issue within the context of the *Ethics, Integrity, and Aptitude* subject in public administration sheds light on its impact on the impartiality and ethical expectations of civil servants.

### Ethical Standards for IAS Officers

IAS officers are expected to uphold high ethical standards to ensure fair and transparent governance. The *All India Services (Conduct) Rules, 1968* outline specific guidelines for officers’ behavior, both in public and private spheres. These guidelines emphasize neutrality, impartiality, and a non-partisan approach to governance, ensuring that decisions are made in the public interest and not influenced by personal beliefs or affiliations.

Social media activity by government officials is governed by these conduct rules to maintain the integrity of their office. Any active or perceived affiliation with groups or platforms that could question their impartiality, or influence public trust, may be seen as a breach of these standards. Therefore, an officer's involvement in social media, especially in groups with potential political or ideological bias, can be scrutinized for violating the principles of neutrality and impartiality.

### The Impact on Non-Partisanship

1. **Perception of Bias**:
   An IAS officer’s involvement in social media groups can create a perception of bias, particularly if the group aligns with specific political or ideological leanings. This perception undermines the core principle of non-partisanship, which is essential for public trust in civil services. Non-partisanship ensures that public servants act without favor or prejudice, regardless of political climate or personal affiliations. Even if an officer’s participation is passive or non-committal, public perception is critical, as any association can be viewed as endorsing a particular viewpoint.

2. **Decision-Making and Public Trust**:
   The ethical responsibility of an IAS officer extends to maintaining impartiality in decision-making processes. If an officer is believed to be associated with a group or platform that promotes specific views, it could lead to doubts about their ability to make unbiased decisions. This affects public trust and raises questions about the officer’s integrity. Decisions made by officials perceived as partial could be met with skepticism, leading to resistance and challenges that compromise administrative efficiency and the legitimacy of governance.

### Balancing Freedom of Expression and Professional Ethics

While IAS officers, like all citizens, have the right to freedom of expression, this right is not absolute. It must be balanced with their duty to remain impartial and uphold the dignity of their office. The fine line between personal freedom and professional responsibilities becomes more pronounced with the rise of social media, which can amplify both positive and negative perceptions.

1. **Guidelines on Social Media Usage**:
   The government has laid down specific guidelines for the use of social media by public servants to ensure that their conduct does not compromise public confidence in their impartiality. These guidelines suggest that civil servants refrain from engaging in public discussions or groups that may conflict with their official duties or imply partiality.

2. **Ethical Dilemmas**:
   The involvement of an IAS officer in social media groups poses ethical dilemmas related to personal beliefs versus professional conduct. While an officer might wish to engage in discussions as a private individual, their public role demands adherence to a stricter code of conduct. This ensures that their actions do not impact their perceived ability to administer without bias.

### Consequences of Action and the Path Forward

Taking action against an IAS officer for involvement in social media groups could reinforce the importance of maintaining high ethical standards and impartiality within public services. It serves as a reminder of the need for clear boundaries between personal opinions and professional responsibilities. However, any action must be proportional and considerate of the context—whether the officer actively contributed to content that undermines their impartiality or simply participated without any partisan engagement.

1. **Strengthening Training and Awareness**:
   To prevent such ethical dilemmas, comprehensive training on social media conduct and the implications of online engagement should be part of IAS officers’ continuous professional development. This would help them navigate the complexities of their role in the digital age while maintaining the ethical standards expected of their position.

2. **Revisiting Guidelines**:
   Updating existing conduct guidelines to reflect current social media trends and potential conflicts can aid in clear decision-making and protect officers from inadvertently breaching ethical standards.

### Conclusion

The case of potential action against an IAS officer for involvement in a social media group highlights the delicate balance between professional impartiality and personal freedom. While it is vital to maintain ethical standards that uphold non-partisanship in public administration, it is equally important to ensure that guidelines and consequences are fair and consistent. Striking this balance will help maintain the credibility and trust that society places in its civil services, aligning with the core principles outlined in the *Ethics, Integrity, and Aptitude* subject.

> The potential action against an IAS officer for involvement in a social media group underscores the importance of impartiality and ethical conduct in public service. IAS officers are expected to uphold neutrality, as outlined in the *All India Services (Conduct) Rules, 1968*, to maintain public trust. Association with groups that could imply bias risks compromising this trust and raises concerns about decision-making impartiality. While IAS officers have freedom of expression, it must align with professional ethics. Strengthening training on social media use and updating conduct guidelines can help officers navigate these challenges while preserving the integrity of their roles.

# Tension in Mandya village over Dalits’ entry into temple

### Impact on Society and Constitutional Provisions for Caste-Based Discrimination

The incident at the Kalabhaireshwara temple in Hanakere, Mandya, where Dalits faced opposition from ‘upper caste’ individuals upon attempting to enter the renovated temple, underscores the deep-seated caste-based discrimination that still persists in India. Such events are not just isolated occurrences; they reflect broader social tensions and challenge the progress towards an inclusive society. Understanding the societal impact and the constitutional provisions that address these issues is crucial for framing an appropriate response and fostering equality.

#### Societal Impact of the Incident

1. **Reinforcement of Caste Divisions**:
   The opposition to Dalits entering a place of worship serves as a stark reminder of the caste-based hierarchies that continue to permeate many parts of Indian society. This incident reinforces social barriers, promoting segregation and inequality. When such acts of discrimination are publicly visible, they embolden regressive elements and hinder the efforts of social reformers who advocate for a caste-free society.

2. **Psychological and Social Consequences**:
   For the Dalit community, being denied access to religious and public spaces reinforces feelings of exclusion and marginalization. This perpetuates a cycle of psychological harm and undermines their dignity and self-worth. These incidents deepen the social divide and contribute to resentment, which can potentially escalate into larger social conflicts.

3. **Obstacle to Social Cohesion**:
   Caste-based discrimination undermines the fabric of a pluralistic society. It erodes trust and cooperation between different social groups, essential for a harmonious and cohesive society. Such incidents remind us that despite legislative and societal advancements, significant work remains in eradicating caste-based biases from daily life. The event could fuel further social unrest, leading to protests or backlash that could polarize communities and destabilize local peace.

4. **Implications for Modern India’s Image**:
   On a broader scale, such incidents tarnish India’s global image as a nation striving for equality and justice. They reflect poorly on the country's commitment to social justice and human rights, potentially affecting its standing in international forums and its ability to lead conversations about social harmony and equity.

#### Constitutional Provisions Addressing Caste-Based Discrimination

The Indian Constitution enshrines a framework that seeks to eliminate caste discrimination and promote equality. The following are key constitutional provisions relevant to this issue:

1. **Article 15**:
   Article 15 prohibits discrimination by the state against any citizen on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth. This article aims to ensure that every citizen is treated equally, and any form of discrimination based on caste is unconstitutional.

2. **Article 17**:
   One of the most significant provisions, Article 17 abolishes ‘untouchability’ in all its forms and forbids its practice in any manner. This article is the cornerstone of efforts to dismantle caste-based discrimination, making acts that perpetuate untouchability punishable under the law.

3. **Article 25**:
   Article 25 guarantees the right to freedom of religion, which includes the right to freely practice, profess, and propagate religion. This right is subject to public order, morality, and health but underscores that every individual, regardless of caste, should have access to religious spaces and practices.

4. **Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955**:
   This Act was enacted to enforce Article 17 and makes it a punishable offense to practice untouchability or to discriminate based on caste in public places, including temples. Violations can result in fines and imprisonment.

5. **Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989**:
   This Act further strengthens the provisions to safeguard the rights of Dalits and Scheduled Tribes. It provides for stringent action against those who commit atrocities or acts of discrimination against these communities, including restricting access to places of worship.

#### The Path Forward

The constitutional and legislative framework to address caste discrimination in India is robust, but its effective implementation remains a challenge. The incident in Mandya highlights the need for local administrations to take proactive measures in promoting social harmony and preventing discriminatory practices. Community programs, awareness campaigns, and stricter enforcement of existing laws are essential to ensure that such incidents do not recur.

Additionally, fostering dialogue between different communities can help break down the barriers of caste and promote a more inclusive society. Public support and grassroots movements are pivotal in driving change and pressuring authorities to uphold constitutional values.

#### Conclusion

The opposition faced by Dalits at the Kalabhaireshwara temple is a stark reminder that caste-based discrimination remains a barrier to equality in India. While the Constitution and various legislative measures provide strong protections against such discrimination, societal attitudes and the effective implementation of these laws are areas that need continued focus. Ensuring that incidents like these become a thing of the past requires collective efforts from the government, civil society, and communities to uphold and practice the ideals of equality and justice enshrined in the Indian Constitution.

> The incident at the Kalabhaireshwara temple in Mandya, where Dalits faced opposition from 'upper caste' individuals, highlights persistent caste discrimination in India. Such events deepen social divisions, undermine community trust, and perpetuate exclusion and psychological harm to marginalized groups. The Indian Constitution, through Articles 15, 17, and 25, and acts like the Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955, and the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, prohibits caste-based discrimination and untouchability. However, effective enforcement and societal change remain challenging. Addressing these issues requires stricter law enforcement, public awareness, and community dialogue to promote equality and uphold constitutional values.
