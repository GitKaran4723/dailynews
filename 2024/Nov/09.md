# SC overrules 1967 verdict against AMU’s minority tag

The Supreme Court of India, in a significant 4:3 majority judgment led by Chief Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, ruled that an educational institution established by a minority community retains its identity as a minority institution even if it is recognized under a statute. This ruling stemmed from petitions seeking minority status for Aligarh Muslim University (AMU). Chief Justice Chandrachud affirmed that minority communities have the right to establish educational institutions to preserve their culture and identity, but they bear the responsibility of proving that the institution was established for this purpose.

This majority judgment challenges the longstanding precedent set by the 1967 S. Azeez Basha versus Union of India case, which held that AMU, as a Central university, could not be classified as a minority institution. The 1967 verdict asserted that religious minorities did not have the right to administer institutions not established by them and therefore could not seek protection under Article 30(1) of the Indian Constitution. Article 30(1) guarantees the right of religious and linguistic minorities to establish and manage their own educational institutions to safeguard their distinct culture.

Chief Justice Chandrachud’s judgment marks a significant shift from the earlier interpretation. He and Justices S.K. Kaul, Sanjiv Khanna, and Bela M. Trivedi formed the majority that overruled the 1967 decision, emphasizing that statutory recognition does not strip an institution of its minority status. This implies that if a community can demonstrate that it established an institution to retain its cultural identity, the institution qualifies for minority status and protection under Article 30(1).

However, not all justices agreed. Justices Surya Kant, Dipankar Datta, and S.C. Sharma dissented, offering separate opinions that highlighted differing views on the interpretation and application of Article 30(1) and the impact of statutory recognition on the minority status of institutions.

The Supreme Court has sent the case back to a regular Bench to further examine AMU’s claim to minority status in light of the new ruling. This decision reopens the discourse around AMU’s identity and the broader implications for other minority-established educational institutions in India.

The ruling is pivotal for minority rights in education. It reinforces the principle that minority communities have the autonomy to establish and manage institutions to maintain their cultural fabric, even if these institutions receive statutory recognition. This judgment supports the view that state recognition or regulation does not inherently negate the minority character of an institution.

The petitions challenging the 1967 verdict reflect the ongoing debate over how the rights guaranteed under Article 30(1) are applied. The 4:3 decision underscores the complex balance between state control, recognition, and the preservation of minority rights. It reinforces the idea that statutory recognition should not dilute the foundational intent of Article 30(1)—to empower minorities to protect and promote their cultural and educational interests.

This landmark judgment reaffirms the right of minority communities to establish educational institutions as a means of preserving their cultural identity while acknowledging that they must substantiate their claims to minority status. The outcome is likely to impact the interpretation of minority rights and the administration of minority-established institutions across India, ensuring that these institutions continue to reflect and support the identity of the communities that established them.

> The Supreme Court, in a 4:3 majority led by Chief Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, ruled that educational institutions established by minority communities retain their minority status even if recognized by statute. This decision, concerning Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), overruled the 1967 S. Azeez Basha case, which stated that religious minorities couldn’t administer institutions not established by them under Article 30(1). The judgment affirmed that minority communities have the right to establish and manage institutions to preserve their culture, provided they can prove this purpose. The case was sent back to a regular Bench to further evaluate AMU’s minority status based on this new ruling.

# The BRICS journey — gaining heft while in transition

Russia’s President Vladimir Putin made only a brief digital appearance at the BRICS 2023 summit in Johannesburg, despite host South Africa’s decision to provide him diplomatic immunity against an ICC-issued arrest warrant linked to the Ukraine war. As the host and Chair of the summit this year, Mr. Putin dominated the show. The three-day summit pushed news about the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and West Asia to the back pages.

### Survival and a rejuvenation

The summit in Kazan, Russia (October 22-24, 2024) was the sixteenth in a series that began in 2009. Only four countries — Brazil, Russia, India and China — participated in the first two summits. South Africa joined the group at the third summit in 2011, giving it its present name, BRICS. The first decade recorded several accomplishments, but the second decade began on a difficult note. The outbreak of COVID-19 put China on the defensive; then the bloody clash between Chinese and Indian troops in the Galwan Valley in June 2020 brought ties between two member-states to a new low; finally, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 triggered Moscow’s confrontation with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. All this made the grouping vulnerable.

Yet, it survived and showed signs of rejuvenation. The 15th summit’s decision on expansion led to five new members: Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Iran, Egypt, and Ethiopia. A disclosure by Mr. Putin that 34 more nations are desirous of joining the grouping signifies that BRICS is headed upwards. Post-summit, the Russian projection was that this grouping represents the ‘Global Majority.’

This transition trajectory needs to be factored in while assessing the outcomes of the Kazan summit and their broad implications for the world. BRICS does not strive to create a new world order. It just wants to reform the present one so that it works for everyone. The grouping is driven by “the BRICS spirit”, which is imbued with eight specific characteristics: mutual respect and understanding; sovereign equality; solidarity; democracy; openness; inclusiveness; collaboration, and consensus. It is committed to promoting intra-BRICS cooperation under three verticals: political and security; economic and financial, and cultural and people-to-people cooperation.

BRICS, initially a grouping of emerging economies, is now primarily a platform for Emerging Markets and Developing Countries (EMDCs). It is a combined grouping of the east and the south, juxtaposed to the Global North. There are notable anti-western tendencies within the BRICS, but its moderate members are committed to safeguarding its non-western orientation.

Pushing for comprehensive United Nations reform, the grouping devised at Johannesburg a careful formulation to support the aspirations of countries from Africa, Asia and Latin America, “including the BRICS countries” (meaning India, Brazil and South Africa) to play a more significant role in the UN, including its Security Council. This remained unchanged at Kazan; no further improvement was registered in favour of the three aspirants. None was expected as China’s reluctance to go beyond this formula is an open secret.

Another significant element was the grouping’s call for the elimination of unilateral economic sanctions. It depicts them as unilateral measures, aptly highlighting that they are contrary to international law and have far-reaching implications for human rights.

### Verticals and their focus

On the first vertical relating to peace and security, the summit focused on the conflict in West Asia, to which several paragraphs were devoted in the declaration. Paragraph 30 has scathing criticism for Israel’s actions without any reference to the October 7 terrorist attack by Hamas. The grouping has called for an immediate and comprehensive ceasefire, unconditional release of all hostages, and the establishment of an independent ‘State of Palestine’. Israel, whose military dominance of the region continues, was not impressed. Its response came in the form of a direct air attack on Iran, a member of BRICS.

With Russia as the chair of BRICS, the grouping said much less about the continuing war in Ukraine. Members were content with reiterating their national positions and calling for the end of war through dialogue and diplomacy while underlining the need to address “the root causes” of conflicts.

On the second vertical of economic and financial cooperation, the common currency issue received maximum attention. The decision taken was along expected lines. The use of local currencies in financial transactions between BRICS countries and their trading partners will be facilitated further. However, the issue of deeper financial and banking cooperation will continue to be studied by the Finance ministries of the member-states.

With Saudi Arabia still hesitant about joining BRICS fully, initial expectations of a massive capital injection into the New Development Bank remain unfulfilled. Therefore, the leaders restricted themselves to suggesting further improvement in the bank’s workings and expressing their commitment to develop it into “a new type of MDB in the 21st century.”

The third vertical aims to strengthen people-to-people exchanges for social and economic development. Cooperation involving sports, culture, parliaments, civil society, business, and think tanks could have a beneficial long-term impact.

Finally, a crucial decision related to the grouping’s expansion. The outreach session was held on the last day, with the participation of 34 states. Having approved the guidelines and criteria, a new category of ‘partner state’ was created. Thirteen countries have been invited to join the grouping as partner states. Latin America: Cuba and Bolivia; Eurasia: Belarus and Türkiye; Africa: Algeria, Nigeria, and Uganda; Southeast Asia: Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam; and Central Asia: Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Clearly, the third expansion will further augment the BRICS family’s share of the world population, international trade and GDP. Between now and the next summit in Brazil in 2025, most of these states may be included as partners, but they are expected to clamour for their early elevation as full members. Hence, the transition may continue for some more time.

### From India’s lens

From India’s perspective, BRICS figures among the top six plurilateral groupings today — G-20, Quad, BRICS, BIMSTEC (The Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation), G-7 (where India has a nearly permanent guest status), and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO). BRICS helps India to promote multipolarity in the world, exercise its strategic autonomy, deepen its relations with Russia, and effectively advocate the interests and agenda of the Global South. In addition, the latest summit served as a useful platform for the first meeting in about five years between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping. Bilateral negotiations resulted in an agreement on border patrolling arrangements and disengagement. Hence, this meeting, held on the summit’s sidelines, heralded the beginning of a rapprochement between New Delhi and Beijing. As China-India relations improve, the strategic space for India to deal with its western partners may also expand.

India attaches a high degree of importance to making BRICS an effective instrument for international cooperation. This nation has made a tangible contribution in this direction and is eager to continue doing so. Initial caution over expansion has now been replaced by a sober calculation that increased membership, if handled properly, will enhance the influence of this plurilateral grouping. Above all, BRICS allows India to serve as a bridge between the west and the east and between the north and the south, thus turning New Delhi into a geopolitical sweet spot today.

> BRICS, comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, has evolved significantly since its inception, gaining economic and geopolitical influence. Initially focused on economic collaboration, the bloc has expanded its agenda to include political coordination and global governance reform. The grouping faces internal challenges such as differing national interests and economic disparities, yet it continues to seek common ground on global issues like trade, climate change, and development finance. With the recent expansion to include new member countries, BRICS is navigating a transitional phase, aiming to strengthen its global role and foster a multipolar world order despite its internal complexities.

# Staying cool, but with clean tech, global collaborations

In a rapidly warming world, cooling is not merely a luxury but a necessity, especially for vulnerable populations. International cooperation on clean energy and cooling solutions is a crucial step toward addressing the climate crisis. On September 21, 2024, the Quad nations (Australia, India, Japan, and the United States) issued the Wilmington Declaration, which underscores the Quad’s commitment to sustainable energy solutions, particularly focusing on high-efficiency cooling systems. This aligns with the earlier joint statement by India and the U.S., which detailed a road map for building resilient and secure global clean energy supply chains, placing a special emphasis on clean cooling technologies. Both statements highlight the urgent need to deploy affordable and energy-efficient cooling systems in climate-vulnerable regions while advancing global climate goals.

India’s leadership in these efforts is particularly noteworthy. As part of the Quad’s clean energy initiatives, India has pledged significant investments in solar and cooling infrastructure across the Indo-Pacific region. Along with the U.S. and India’s joint plan to expand manufacturing capacities for high-efficiency air-conditioners and ceiling fans, these developments could significantly reduce the climate impact of cooling systems.

### Cooling-related emissions

The broader relevance of these international efforts can be seen through the lens of the Montreal Protocol and its Kigali Amendment (2016), which already set a precedent for collective global action on cooling-related emissions. As global temperatures rise, increasing demand for cooling makes it imperative for the world to adopt the lessons of these frameworks, reducing harmful emissions while transitioning to sustainable alternatives.

The Kigali Amendment expanded its scope to target hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), potent greenhouse gases used in cooling appliances. Left unchecked, HFCs could contribute to 0.52°C of warming by 2100. Maximising the Kigali Amendment’s impact requires aligning the HFC phase-down with energy efficiency improvements. More efficient cooling systems could deliver about two-thirds of total greenhouse gas reductions by cutting electricity consumption. This would reduce emissions, lower air pollution from fossil fuel power plants, and save costs for manufacturers and consumers.

Climate change has heightened two critical threats related to cooling: the indirect emissions from inefficient air-conditioning and refrigeration systems powered by fossil fuels, and the direct emissions from harmful refrigerants. However, many countries still lack integrated energy efficiency and refrigerant standards. High-efficiency air conditioners using climate-friendly refrigerants are available, but inefficient models using outdated refrigerants still dominate many markets. Without stronger regulations, developing nations risk becoming dumping grounds for these inefficient appliances, exacerbating climate and energy challenges.

### Having a mission-mode approach

In 2024, parts of India experienced temperatures over 50°C, underscoring the need for cooling to ensure thermal comfort, preserve food, medical supplies, and industrial processes. India, one of the most climate-vulnerable nations, faces increasingly severe heatwaves that endanger millions. By 2030, an estimated 160 million to 200 million Indians could face deadly heatwaves annually. The country’s workforce, heavily exposed to extreme heat, risks significant declines in productivity, health, and food security. Cooling demand is expected to surge, with air conditioner sales rising 16% for every degree over 30°C. By 2050, India may have the world’s highest cooling demand, with over 1.14 billion air conditioners in use.

India ratified the Kigali Amendment in 2021, committing to reduce HFCs by 85% by 2047. The India Cooling Action Plan (ICAP) targets a 20%-25% reduction in cooling demand, 25-40% in energy consumption, and a shift to low-global warming potential (GWP) refrigerants, demonstrating leadership in climate-friendly cooling. A mission-mode approach is needed to tackle these challenges. A national mission for sustainable cooling would require focused leadership, cross-sectoral collaboration, and coordinated efforts across ministries. Establishing an inter-ministerial working group, planning a launch event, and allocating an initial budget are essential. National capacity-building initiatives and dedicated budget lines must follow for long-term success.

### COP29 and the momentum of COP28

International commitments to clean energy cooling are encouraging, but technologies must remain affordable. The U.S.-India partnership and the Quad’s initiatives emphasise deployment and local manufacturing of high-efficiency cooling systems. The challenge is in ensuring equitable access, particularly in developing regions where cooling needs are the greatest. Rising global temperatures require scaling up energy-efficient solutions without straining fragile electricity grids or leaving vulnerable populations behind.

India’s proactive approach to cooling challenges, especially through the ICAP, positions it as a global leader in sustainable cooling. The country can protect its population from heat while leading the global fight against climate change, ensuring thermal comfort for all.

At COP28 (Dubai), 63 countries pledged to reduce cooling emissions by 68% by 2050. The Global Cooling Pledge, though non-binding, could provide cooling access to 3.5 billion people by 2050 and save $17 trillion in energy costs. However, global action must accelerate to make this a reality. COP29 must build on the momentum of COP28 by expanding cooling commitments. This includes increasing participation in the Global Cooling Pledge and enhancing partnerships across sectors and nations.

> The push for sustainable cooling solutions is gaining momentum as global temperatures rise. Clean technology and international collaborations are pivotal in developing efficient cooling systems that minimize environmental impact. Innovations include energy-efficient air conditioners, refrigerants with lower global warming potential, and advancements in passive cooling techniques. Partnerships between nations and organizations foster shared research, funding, and the adoption of best practices. These efforts aim to meet rising cooling demands while reducing greenhouse gas emissions and conserving energy. By leveraging clean tech and fostering international cooperation, countries can achieve sustainable cooling, crucial for mitigating climate change and ensuring public health and comfort.

# Men should not train women in gyms: U.P. Women’s Commission

The Uttar Pradesh State Women Commission’s proposal to bar male tailors from taking women’s measurements and restrict men from training women in gyms and yoga centres can be viewed through multiple perspectives:

### 1. **Intent for Women’s Safety**:
The proposal appears to be driven by a desire to enhance women's safety and prevent harassment or uncomfortable situations. It reflects concerns about safeguarding women in spaces where close physical contact or supervision is common, aiming to minimize potential risks of abuse or inappropriate behavior.

### 2. **Concerns About Overreach**:
Critics may argue that such measures could be viewed as an overreach, potentially reinforcing gender segregation and implying that men inherently pose a threat. This could reinforce negative stereotypes and create further division between genders in professional and social settings.

### 3. **Impact on Employment and Opportunities**:
Implementing such restrictions could negatively impact male professionals working in tailoring, fitness, or wellness industries, limiting their livelihood opportunities. This could affect men who have built their careers in these fields and may be seen as an unfair generalization that stigmatizes an entire group based on the actions of a few.

### 4. **Addressing Root Causes**:
Proposals like these may be criticized for focusing on superficial solutions rather than addressing the deeper, systemic issues contributing to women's safety concerns, such as weak enforcement of existing laws, lack of awareness, or inadequate training for handling professional conduct in workplaces.

### 5. **Empowerment vs. Restriction**:
While the intent might be to create safer environments, some might see these measures as restrictive rather than empowering for women. Instead of barring interactions between genders, focusing on creating robust mechanisms that ensure safety, promote respectful conduct, and hold violators accountable might be more effective.

### 6. **Gender Equality and Modern Context**:
In a modern context where gender equality and inclusivity are promoted, such measures could be viewed as a step back. Emphasizing mutual respect, comprehensive training for all genders, and fostering inclusive spaces could be seen as more progressive approaches.

### Conclusion:
While the Uttar Pradesh State Women Commission’s proposal aims to prioritize women’s safety, its implications are complex. It risks reinforcing gender stereotypes, affecting employment for men, and potentially ignoring the importance of broader systemic solutions. Comprehensive safety measures that promote respect, inclusivity, and accountability might be more effective in genuinely improving women's safety.
