# Push for social security benefits for platform, gig workers

### Push for Social Security Benefits for Platform and Gig Workers

Platform and gig workers, a rapidly growing segment of India’s workforce, play a crucial role in the economy, especially in the digital and service sectors. These workers, employed through online platforms like food delivery, ride-hailing, and freelance portals, often lack formal employment contracts and are excluded from essential social security benefits such as health insurance, pension, and maternity leave. Recognizing their contribution and vulnerabilities, there is a growing call for extending social security protections to this workforce.

---

### **Challenges Faced by Gig and Platform Workers**

1. **Lack of Job Security**:
   - Gig workers operate as independent contractors, not regular employees, which denies them job security and continuity of income.

2. **Absence of Social Security**:
   - They are not entitled to benefits like health insurance, pension, and paid leave, making them vulnerable to financial hardships during illness, accidents, or unemployment.

3. **Unpredictable Income**:
   - Their earnings depend on the volume of work assigned by platforms, often subject to algorithm-driven decisions, resulting in irregular and unstable incomes.

4. **Occupational Hazards**:
   - Delivery workers, drivers, and other gig workers face high risks of accidents, long working hours, and mental stress without adequate compensation or support.

5. **Digital Dependency**:
   - With platforms dictating terms, gig workers have limited bargaining power, and sudden policy changes can significantly impact their livelihoods.

### **Need for Social Security Benefits**

The demand for social security benefits stems from the following considerations:
1. **Economic Contribution**:
   - Gig and platform workers significantly contribute to the economy by driving the digital and service sectors.
   - Their inclusion in the social security net ensures sustained economic growth by supporting their well-being.

2. **Vulnerability During Crises**:
   - The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the precarious nature of gig work, as many workers faced job losses and lacked financial support during lockdowns.

3. **Legal and Ethical Responsibility**:
   - Companies benefiting from gig workers’ labor have a moral obligation to ensure their welfare.
   - Legislative frameworks should mandate minimum protections.

4. **Global Practices**:
   - Many countries, including the UK and the EU, have introduced regulations to ensure social security for gig workers, setting examples for India to follow.

---

### **Proposed Measures for Social Security**

1. **Universal Coverage**:
   - Include gig workers in existing social security schemes such as the **Employees’ State Insurance Scheme (ESI)** and **Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF)**.

2. **Dedicated Framework**:
   - Implement the provisions of the **Code on Social Security, 2020**, which mandates benefits like health insurance, accident cover, and maternity benefits for gig and platform workers.

3. **Platform Contributions**:
   - Require platforms to contribute a percentage of their revenue toward a social security fund for workers.

4. **Skill Development**:
   - Provide training programs to upskill workers, enabling them to access better-paying opportunities.

5. **Policy Transparency**:
   - Mandate clear and transparent policies on payments, working hours, and grievance redressal mechanisms.

### Mental Health Challenges of Sex Workers: A Neglected Crisis

Globally, sex workers face significant mental health challenges, worsened by societal stigma, violence, economic pressures, and isolation. While public discourse often romanticizes or criminalizes sex work, it seldom addresses the profound emotional and psychological issues sex workers encounter. Their unique circumstances make them particularly vulnerable to mental health disorders, yet access to mental health services remains inadequate. Addressing this crisis requires understanding the root causes and implementing targeted interventions.

---

### **Spectrum of Mental Health Issues**

Sex workers suffer from a range of mental health conditions, including:
1. **Anxiety and Depression**: These stem from constant stress, societal rejection, and financial insecurity.
2. **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)**: Repeated exposure to violence and trauma leaves many with severe PTSD symptoms.
3. **Substance Use Disorders**: Coping with the emotional toll of their work often drives some sex workers to substance abuse.

---

### **Key Contributing Factors**

1. **Stigma and Social Ostracization**:
   - The societal stigma attached to sex work is one of the most significant contributors to mental health issues.
   - Ostracized by their families and communities, sex workers face isolation, which deprives them of basic human rights, such as healthcare, housing, and education.
   - This alienation creates a barrier to accessing essential mental health services, leaving sex workers to cope with psychological distress in isolation.

2. **Violence and Exploitation**:
   - Violence is a constant threat in the lives of sex workers. Many face physical, emotional, and sexual violence from clients, pimps, and even law enforcement.
   - Such violence results in repeated trauma, which contributes to PTSD and exacerbates other mental health disorders.
   - The cycle of violence often leaves victims feeling trapped, compounding feelings of helplessness and despair.

3. **Economic Pressures**:
   - Most sex workers enter the profession due to economic necessity, often lacking other viable employment opportunities.
   - Financial instability exacerbates mental health issues, especially when combined with the risks and uncertainties of the work environment.

4. **Isolation**:
   - Social exclusion and lack of support networks intensify feelings of loneliness and depression.
   - Many sex workers are reluctant to seek help due to fear of judgment, further isolating them from potential avenues of support.

---

### **Barriers to Mental Health Services**

1. **Lack of Accessibility**:
   - Mental health services are often unavailable or inaccessible to sex workers, particularly those from marginalized communities.

2. **Fear of Judgment**:
   - The stigma surrounding sex work deters many from seeking help, fearing discrimination from healthcare providers.

3. **Economic Constraints**:
   - Even where services exist, they are often unaffordable for sex workers, who may prioritize immediate financial needs over long-term mental health care.

4. **Policy Gaps**:
   - Many countries lack inclusive healthcare policies that cater specifically to the needs of sex workers, further alienating them from formal health systems.

---

### **Breaking the Cycle: Interventions and Solutions**

1. **Decriminalization and Policy Reform**:
   - Decriminalizing sex work can reduce stigma and improve access to healthcare and social services.
   - Governments must adopt policies that explicitly protect sex workers' rights, ensuring their safety and dignity.

2. **Trauma-Informed Care**:
   - Healthcare providers should adopt trauma-informed approaches to treat sex workers with empathy and understanding.
   - Mental health professionals must be trained to address the unique challenges faced by sex workers.

3. **Community-Based Support**:
   - Establish peer support networks and community-based organizations that provide counseling, legal aid, and advocacy.
   - Safe spaces where sex workers can share experiences and access resources without fear of judgment can significantly improve their mental health.

4. **Accessible Mental Health Services**:
   - Governments and NGOs must invest in affordable and accessible mental health services tailored to the needs of sex workers.
   - Mobile clinics and telehealth platforms can bridge the gap for those in remote or underserved areas.

5. **Awareness Campaigns**:
   - Public awareness campaigns can reduce stigma and promote understanding of the challenges faced by sex workers.
   - Educating the public about the realities of sex work can foster empathy and support for mental health interventions.

6. **Violence Prevention**:
   - Strengthen laws to protect sex workers from violence and exploitation.
   - Collaborate with law enforcement agencies to ensure that sex workers are treated with respect and provided legal protection.

---

### **Conclusion**

The mental health challenges faced by sex workers are deeply rooted in societal stigma, violence, and exclusion. Addressing these issues requires a multi-faceted approach, including decriminalization, policy reform, accessible healthcare, and community support. By fostering an environment of inclusion and empathy, society can help break the cycle of trauma and isolation, ensuring that sex workers receive the dignity, safety, and care they deserve. Mental health is a basic human right, and it must be extended to every individual, irrespective of their profession.

# How India could counter the CBAM

Protectionism is a threat to the collaboration required between the developed and developing world in addressing climate issues. Innovative protectionist ideas, such as the **European Union’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (EU-CBAM)**, the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive, and the EU Deforestation Regulation, have led to concerns in developing nations. India has criticised the EU-CBAM, in particular, as being “arbitrary”.

### A ‘discriminatory’ tool

The **CBAM** is meant to ensure that imported products bear a carbon emission cost comparable to the cost imposed on goods produced within the EU. Exporters will be mandated to provide information on the quantity and emissions of their goods and buy certificates to match those emissions. The definite phase of the CBAM will enter into force on January 1, 2026. This may pose significant risks to India’s international trade. The EU comprises 20.33% of India’s total merchandise exports, of which 25.7% are affected by CBAM. During the last five fiscal years, iron and steel have accounted for 76.83% of these exports, followed by aluminium, cement, and fertilizers.

In recent editions of the **Conference of the Parties (COPs)**, India has said that CBAM is “discriminatory” and called on developing countries to establish a coordinated response to what it considers as an unjust transfer of responsibilities. The CBAM is attracting considerable attention at COP29 in Baku. However, under-prepared arguments presented at COP29 could undermine India’s credibility as a leading voice of the Global South.

It is important to recognise that not all developing economies share the same economic aspirations as India, nor will they be equally affected by the impacts of climate change. Therefore, perceptions regarding CBAM are complex even within the developing world. Issues related to multilateral and bilateral trade and cultural ties between developed and developing economies influence the tone of their arguments. The current production-based accounting principle practiced under the **United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC)** includes the emissions resulting from the production of exportable commodities within the emission inventory of the exporting nation. The exporting nation is held accountable for the reduction of these emissions, even though these products are not consumed within its domestic market. As a result, many developing economies with less stringent emission reduction measures are accused of climate change when they export more.


### The proposed arguments

Therefore, India’s arguments should also align with other developing countries’ agenda, if India wishes to speak like a leader. The following could be some of the arguments. First, on the time for preparing for CBAM. With administrative deftness, the EU set a target to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 20% compared to 1990 levels by 2020; this is outlined in the EU Climate Action and Renewable Energy Package in 2008. Following the accomplishment of these targets, the European Green Deal was unveiled in 2019, extending the emission reduction target to 55% below the 1990 levels in a Fit for 55 Package. Does the CBAM offer developing economies a matchable time to adapt?

The second is on empowerment. The EU has decided to keep the revenues generated from the CBAM as its resources, which will be used to fund the Next Generation EU recovery tool and operate the CBAM. Depending on the mechanism’s ultimate design, the anticipated additional money generated by CBAM for 2030 is estimated to be €5 to €14 billion annually. Is it appropriate for the EU not to share this revenue with non-EU trading partners? Doing so may contribute to capacity building and technology transfer in developing economies.

Third, there is the issue of quantifying emission reduction responsibilities. India can justifiably advocate for an alternative called Equity-based Accounting (EBA) of Nationally Determined Contributions, which emphasises a collective obligation for emission reductions among trade partners based on the ideas of horizontal intra-generational equity and vertical inter-generational equity. In the context of the EU-CBAM, India can introduce the concept of EBA to the developing world concerning retaliation measures. Using the EBA, a formula can be proposed to calculate the tariff base on imports from the EU, which considers factors such as relative per capita GDP, relative per capita emissions, relative gains from trade, and relative avoided emissions through trade. By expressing the actual emissions embedded in imports in a way that reflects the developmental and historical heterogeneities between trade partners, any developing economy can be better positioned under these new rules of the game, which provide an unbiased evaluation of climate initiatives.

Even the PBA adheres to the principle of **Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities**, which is significantly compromised under the CBAM framework. CBAM does not acknowledge compensatory justice or distributive justice. Consequently, the allocation of emission responsibilities is not equitably assigned to countries based on their historical contributions to climate change or their capacity to mitigate its effects. It is apparent that through CBAM, the EU wants to intimidate non-EU nations into adopting its self-proclaimed position as climate leader.

> India can counter the EU’s **Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)**, which imposes tariffs on carbon-intensive imports, by adopting strategic measures. These include enhancing domestic green manufacturing, investing in renewable energy, and incentivizing industries to transition to cleaner technologies. Strengthening carbon accounting and certification systems can align exports with global sustainability standards. Engaging in diplomatic negotiations and leveraging platforms like the WTO can address trade imbalances and carbon equity concerns. Additionally, India could impose reciprocal carbon tariffs on imports from high-emission countries. These steps will ensure competitiveness in global markets while aligning with India's climate goals and economic interests.

### **Bima Sugam: Addressing Forced Selling of Insurance**

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman recently highlighted the issue of **‘forced selling’** of insurance products by banks, a practice where customers feel coerced into purchasing insurance policies while availing of banking services. In response, **Debasish Panda**, Chairperson of the **Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI)**, emphasized that the upcoming **Bima Sugam** platform would help tackle this issue to some extent.

**Forced selling** occurs when customers are pressured into buying insurance as a precondition to access banking services, such as loans or savings accounts. This often leads to the purchase of unsuitable products, causing dissatisfaction and financial strain for the customer. Sitharaman’s remarks highlight the need for a fair and ethical approach to insurance distribution.

### **IRDAI’s Stand**

While addressing the issue, Mr. Panda acknowledged that selling insurance through banks—known as **bancassurance**—remains a **“useful system”** for reaching diverse customer segments. Banks act as a convenient channel for customers to access insurance products. However, he also emphasized the importance of customer-centric practices and transparent operations.
