# What happens to Indian firms on U.S. blacklist?

The government is still gauging the impact of a decision by the U.S. Treasury department to impose sanctions on 19 Indian entities among nearly 400 companies, mainly for supplying “dual-use” technologies to Russia. In addition, the Bureau of Industry and Security run by the U.S. Commerce Department added 40 companies including five from India for re-exporting goods and parts to Russia that were imported from the U.S.

### Why are recent U.S. sanctions significant?

Since April 2021, when U.S. President Joe Biden passed an executive order (E.O. 14024) on “Blocking Property With Respect To Specified Harmful Foreign Activities of the Government of the Russian Federation”, the U.S. has sanctioned hundreds of companies from more than 20 countries worldwide for supplies and sales to Russia, including some from India. But on October 30, the U.S. Department of Treasury invoked the E.O. to sanction 19 Indian entities, including companies and individuals for providing “dual-use” technologies to Russia and other deals with Russian companies calling them “Third-Country Sanctions Evaders”. The companies, mostly based in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Bengaluru and Hyderabad, are reputable, well-established companies dealing in technological manufacturing, with some even holding government contracts. These companies will now be on a U.S. “blacklist”, have assets or funds in the U.S. frozen, and face travel bans.

### How has the Indian government responded?

The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has been fairly muted on the action by the U.S., which is likely to cost Indian companies millions of dollars in contracts and legal appeals. When asked during a briefing, Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said that the MEA had “seen reports of U.S. sanctions”, but declined to comment on whether this was discussed between U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and NSA Ajit Doval, who spoke a day later. The MEA said the companies were “not in violation of Indian laws”, and pointed out that the government was trying to “clarify issues”. “India has a robust legal and regulatory framework on strategic trade and non-proliferation controls,” Mr. Jaiswal said, referring to India’s membership of key non-proliferation export control regimes such as the Wassenaar Arrangement, Australia Group and the Missile Technology Control Regime.

### What else can India do?

India does not recognise unilateral sanctions by the U.S. or any other country, following only those sanctions imposed by the UN. However, as India-U.S. high-tech trade increases, the U.S.’s strictures will have an increasing impact on both Indian companies and the government’s moves. According to the MEA, Indian agencies are already “sensitising” Indian companies on the new measures being implemented by the U.S. that could impact them. The government could also increase measures to sanction-proof those Indian companies doing business with Russia, by building more structural banking mechanisms, and facilitating payments in national currencies, as have been explored for refineries procuring Russian oil, diamond processing units and other sectors where the U.S. and EU sanctions have been the most stringent. Eventually, rejecting any U.S. decision will come at the cost of bilateral ties, and the government will have to evaluate the cost-benefit calculus on whether to accept U.S.’s moves, or to react more strongly to sanctions.

### Will the Trump victory make a difference?

While a new U.S. administration after Donald Trump’s electoral win is expected to pursue a softer line on Russia, it is unlikely that these sanctions will be removed anytime soon, say analysts. During his campaign, Mr. Trump has consistently side-stepped any criticism of Russia’s war in Ukraine, saying that once he comes to power, he would “end the war within 24 hours”. This has been seen as an indication that the Trump administration would not impose further sanctions on Russia. However, the U.S. Congress has frequently taken very tough positions on Russia, and in 2017, virtually forced Mr. Trump’s hand during his first tenure into signing the CAATSA law (Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act) that threatened sanctions against countries for procuring major Russian military hardware, including the S-400 missile defence systems that India has signed a deal for. While Mr. Trump has led the Republican party to a majority in the Senate, it is unlikely that he will reverse any of the sanctions already imposed on Russia.

> Indian firms placed on the U.S. blacklist face significant challenges, including restrictions on accessing U.S. technology, goods, and services. This can disrupt their operations, limit their ability to collaborate with U.S. companies, and hinder their global supply chain access. Such blacklisting often arises from national security or foreign policy concerns. Affected firms may experience damage to their reputation, reduced investor confidence, and difficulties in maintaining international partnerships. To mitigate these impacts, blacklisted firms might seek alternative markets or suppliers, but the restrictions can still pose serious obstacles to growth and competitiveness in international business environments.

# What are the costs of population decline?

The Chief Ministers of both Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu expressed concerns about the low fertility rates in their States recently. Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu has said that he planned to introduce legislation to incentivise more children per family.

### What is the current demographic situation, especially in the southern States?

After decades of family planning policies seeking to slow population growth, India has been waking up to the fact that the success of such policies is also leading to an increasingly ageing population. This is not a uniform phenomenon — southern States, as well as smaller northern States have seen a much sharper decrease in total fertility rates, defined as the average number of children born to women during their child-bearing years. Tamil Nadu and West Bengal, for instance, recorded fertility rates of 1.4 between 2019 and 2021, according to data from the Office of the Registrar General of India, while Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Kerala, Punjab, and Himachal Pradesh had fertility rates of 1.5. At the other end of the spectrum are Bihar, with a fertility rate of 3, Uttar Pradesh (2.7), and Madhya Pradesh (2.6). States with lower fertility rates have largely developed faster, but are now faced with the spectre of a rapidly ageing population. The India Ageing report published by UNFPA last year used Health Ministry data to show that while the share of India’s elderly population is projected to rise from 10.1% in 2021 to 15% by 2036, the demographic transition is more advanced in some States. In Kerala, senior citizens accounted for 16.5% of the population in 2021, a figure that is set to rise to 22.8% by 2036; T.N.’s elderly will make up 20.8% of its population in 2036, while it will be 19% in Andhra Pradesh. In Bihar, on the other hand, only 7.7% were elderly in 2021, and this is projected to rise to just 11% in 2036.

### What is the likely economic impact?

“India’s demographic transition is much ahead of its socio-economic transition… To understand the impact of this, the most important indicator is not the proportion of the elderly population, but rather the old age dependency ratio, that is, how many older people are there for every 100 people of working age, between 18 to 59 years,” says Srinivas Goli, an Associate Professor at the International Institute for Population Sciences. “When this ratio goes above 15%, that is when you have the onset of an ageing crisis.” A number of States have already crossed this point, according to projections by the National Commission on Population, with Kerala having an old age dependency ratio of 26.1 in 2021, followed by Tamil Nadu (20.5), Himachal Pradesh (19.6), and Andhra Pradesh (18.5). This means these States’ window of opportunity, to reap the demographic dividend of economic growth from a large number of young workers unburdened by the economic and health demands of a large number of minor or elderly dependents, has already closed.

Health expenses are likely to rise significantly in States with ageing populations. One analysis of NSSO data, in a study on demographic diversity by Tulane University’s K.S. James and IIPS scholar Shubhra Kriti published by The India Forum, shows that the southern States, with just one-fifth of India’s population, spent 32% of the country’s total out-of-pocket expenditure on cardiovascular diseases in 2017-18, while eight Hindi belt States with half the country’s population, spent just 24%.

The solution proposed by the Chief Ministers of increasing the fertility rate is also likely to reduce women’s participation in the labour force, which will also hurt their economies. Southern politicians have also raised concerns with the Finance Commission that while their successful economies have pumped in higher tax revenues to the central pool, they get a diminishing share of the central pie of resources due to their slowing population growth.

### What are the political implications?

Uneven population growth is set to shake up the federal structure, with the current freeze on the number of seats in Parliament set to expire in 2026, after which a new delimitation exercise will change the representation that States have in the Lok Sabha. The study by James and Kriti estimated that Uttar Pradesh is likely to gain 12 seats, followed by Bihar (10) and Rajasthan (7), while Tamil Nadu is set to lose nine seats, followed by Kerala (6) and Andhra Pradesh (5), due to their falling share in national population.

### What are the solutions being considered?

The southern CMs seem to be advocating pro-natalist policies by incentivising women to have more babies. “This has not been a very successful approach internationally. Educated women know they are not reproductive machines, and forced fertility will not work, nor will incentives that do not recognise what families actually need,” says Dr. Goli. He recommends changes in work-family policies, with paid maternity and paternity leaves, accessible childcare, and employment policies that reduce the “motherhood penalty”. He notes that States and nations with better gender equity are better able to maintain fertility rates at sustainable levels, as women are more likely to have children if they will not be deprived of economic independence while doing so.

Another approach is to increase the working lifespan and thus reduce the old age dependency ratio. The southern States are already magnets for economic migrants. However, Dr. Goli points out that though these migrants make social security demands of their destination States, they continue to be counted in their home States for political and financial distribution purposes, leaving southern States in a difficult tangle.

> Population decline can lead to significant economic and social costs. A shrinking workforce results in reduced economic productivity, affecting GDP growth and leading to labor shortages. Fewer working-age individuals also mean a higher dependency ratio, with a smaller base of taxpayers supporting a larger elderly population, straining social security and healthcare systems. This can lead to increased government spending on welfare and healthcare, potentially raising tax burdens. Population decline may also cause reduced consumer demand, impacting businesses and economic dynamism. Socially, it can lead to depopulated areas, school closures, and weakened community structures, affecting societal cohesion and development.

# India will fail to meet 2025 TB ‘elimination’ target

In March 2018, Prime Minister Narendra Modi set an ambitious goal of “eliminating” TB by **2025**, five years ahead of the **United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)** deadline set for **2030**. Mr. Modi reiterated the government’s goal of “eliminating” TB by 2025 even in March 2023 while inaugurating the **One World TB Summit 2023** in Varanasi.

The SDG targets for 2030 is 90% reduction in TB deaths compared with 2015 and 80% reduction in TB incidence compared with 2015. As per WHO’s post-2015 End TB Strategy, compared with 2015, countries are required to meet the2025 milestonesof reducing TB deaths by 75%, and reducing TB incidence rate by 50%. But as per the **WHO Global TB Report 2024** and the India TB Report 2024 released a few days ago, India will not be able to even meet the 2025 milestones set by the WHO End TB Strategy, let alone achieving the ambitious goal of “eliminating” TB by 2025.

According to the **India TB Report 2024**, the TB incidence rate in India in 2015 was 237 per 1,00,000 population and the mortality rate was 28 per 1,00,000 population in 2015. According to the **WHO global TB report 2024**, the TB incidence rate for India in 2023 was 195 per 1,00,000 population. It was 199 per 1,00,000 in 2022. In the case of TB mortality, the rate was 22 per 1,00,000 population in 2023, down from 23 per one lakh in 2022. As per the WHO report, the TB incidence rate in India had reduced by 18% between 2015 and 2023, while the reduction in the total number of TB deaths between 2015 and 2023 was only 24%. Since the **End TB Strategy 2025** milestone requires 75% reduction in the total number of TB deaths and 50% reduction in TB incidence, India has to reduce the TB death rate from 28 per 1,00,000 in 2015 to seven per 1,00,000 by 2025 and the TB incidence rate from 237 per 1,00,000 in 2015 to 118.5 per 1,00,000 by 2025. Not only will India fail to “eliminate” TB by 2025, it will not even be able to meet even the End TB Strategy 2025 milestones for TB incidence and the total number of TB deaths.

Worse, even in 2023, India has not met the 2020 milestones of the End TB Strategy for both TB incidence and deaths. As per the End TB Strategy target for 2020, there should have been a 35% reduction in the number of TB deaths compared with 2015 and 20% reduction in TB incidence rate compared with 2015. With only 24% reduction in the total number of TB deaths and 18% reduction in TB incidence between 2015 and 2023, India has not even met the 2020 milestones for TB deaths and TB incidence even three years after the 2020 target date.

India did not meet the ‘elimination’ targets set for 2023 by the **India’s National Strategic Plan for TB elimination**: 2017-2025 report published in 2017 — reducing the estimated TB incidence rate per lakh population to 77, and reducing the estimated TB deaths per 1,00,000 population to six.

Despite the very slow progress in reducing TB incidence and deaths and far from “eliminating” TB by 2025, a November 5PIB release says India achieved a “noteworthy 17.7% decline in TB incidence from 2015 to 2023, a rate that is over twice the global average decline of 8.3%”, as reported by the WHO Global TB Report 2024.

India is unlikely to meet its 2025 target for eliminating tuberculosis (TB), a goal that is more ambitious than the global target of 2030 set by the World Health Organization (WHO). This delay is attributed to several persistent challenges and systemic issues despite significant government initiatives to combat TB. Here’s an analysis of the reasons behind the projected shortfall and what the government has done so far to address TB.

### Reasons India is Struggling to Meet the 2025 TB Target

1. **High Burden and Social Factors**: India carries the highest burden of TB in the world, accounting for about 25% of global TB cases. The disease is prevalent in socio-economically disadvantaged groups, where crowded living conditions, malnutrition, and limited access to healthcare fuel its spread. Addressing these social determinants is difficult and requires more than medical intervention.

2. **COVID-19 Pandemic Disruptions**: The COVID-19 pandemic severely disrupted TB detection, treatment, and monitoring programs. Resources and health personnel were redirected towards managing the pandemic, causing delays in diagnosing and treating TB cases. This led to a backlog of untreated cases and an increased transmission rate.

3. **Undiagnosed and Drug-Resistant TB**: Many TB cases go undiagnosed or are diagnosed late due to lack of awareness, inadequate healthcare infrastructure, and limited access to advanced diagnostic facilities. Moreover, multi-drug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) poses an even greater challenge due to its complex treatment regimen and higher treatment costs.

4. **Stigma and Awareness Issues**: The social stigma associated with TB discourages people from seeking timely diagnosis and treatment. This contributes to continued transmission and delays in controlling the disease.

5. **Healthcare Infrastructure Gaps**: Despite efforts to improve healthcare facilities, significant gaps remain in rural and remote areas, where healthcare access is limited. The availability of trained personnel and modern diagnostic tools varies greatly, affecting early detection and treatment.

### Government Initiatives to Combat TB

The Indian government has made significant efforts to combat TB through a variety of strategies and programs:

1. **National TB Elimination Program (NTEP)**: Formerly known as the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program (RNTCP), NTEP is a robust initiative aimed at providing comprehensive TB care and management. It includes free diagnostic and treatment services, strengthened surveillance systems, and public health campaigns to improve TB awareness.

2. **Nikshay Ecosystem**: The government launched the Nikshay digital platform for better tracking and monitoring of TB cases. This includes the *Nikshay Poshan Yojana*, which provides financial support to TB patients to ensure proper nutrition during treatment.

3. **TB Free India Campaign**: Initiated in 2018, this campaign aims to create a social movement to eradicate TB by raising public awareness, reducing stigma, and increasing community participation in TB prevention and treatment efforts.

4. **Partnerships and Collaborations**: The government has collaborated with various international organizations, NGOs, and private health providers to enhance TB diagnosis, treatment, and awareness. This includes partnerships with WHO and the Global Fund to support TB initiatives in India.

5. **Expansion of Diagnostics and Treatment**: The government has deployed molecular diagnostic tools like GeneXpert machines for rapid TB testing and introduced newer drug regimens to improve treatment outcomes, particularly for drug-resistant TB. Initiatives also include the provision of free drugs, such as bedaquiline and delamanid, to combat MDR-TB.

6. **Community Engagement**: Through initiatives like active case finding and door-to-door awareness campaigns, the government aims to reach vulnerable populations and ensure that TB cases are detected and treated promptly.

### Conclusion and Way Forward

Despite these initiatives, India’s target of eliminating TB by 2025 faces significant challenges due to systemic issues exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and socio-economic factors. To bridge the gap, India needs to further strengthen its healthcare infrastructure, expand access to diagnostic facilities, and address social determinants like nutrition and living conditions. Enhanced public-private partnerships, increased funding, and innovative approaches such as mobile health units and AI-powered diagnostics could also play a crucial role.

Combating stigma and raising awareness through targeted campaigns, alongside bolstering community-based healthcare, will be essential. While India may not meet its 2025 target, continued focus and comprehensive strategies can ensure significant progress toward eliminating TB in the near future.

> India is unlikely to meet its 2025 TB elimination target due to challenges such as a high disease burden, social determinants like poverty and overcrowding, disrupted healthcare services during the COVID-19 pandemic, undiagnosed cases, drug-resistant TB, and stigma. The government has made significant efforts, including the National TB Elimination Program (NTEP), the Nikshay Ecosystem for tracking cases, and the TB Free India campaign. Collaborative efforts with global partners and increased use of advanced diagnostics and treatment have also been employed. However, gaps in healthcare infrastructure, public awareness, and accessibility remain. Continued improvements and strategic efforts are essential for progress.

# Ahead of COP-29, India to emphasise Paris deal red lines on climate finance

Yes, it is correct that India is focusing on climate finance from developed countries ahead of COP-29. This emphasis aligns with India's consistent stance in international climate negotiations, particularly under the Paris Agreement. Here’s why this focus is significant and what the potential way forward could be for India and other developing nations:

### India’s Focus on Climate Finance

1. **Commitments Under the Paris Agreement**:
   The Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015, mandates developed countries to mobilize $100 billion annually by 2020 to support developing countries in their climate actions. However, this target has not been fully met. India, like many other developing nations, underscores that the success of global climate goals depends on substantial financial support to aid their transition to low-carbon economies, adaptation, and resilience efforts.

2. **Developing Country Priorities**:
   Developing nations, including India, face unique challenges such as balancing economic growth with climate commitments, addressing poverty, and supporting vulnerable communities. Climate finance is essential for these countries to scale up renewable energy projects, invest in sustainable infrastructure, enhance disaster resilience, and ensure that their development paths are aligned with climate goals.

3. **Historical Responsibility**:
   India’s call for developed countries to provide more climate finance is rooted in the principle of *Common But Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities* (CBDR-RC). This principle acknowledges that developed countries, historically responsible for the majority of greenhouse gas emissions, bear greater responsibility for supporting developing countries in their climate efforts.

### Why Emphasis on Climate Finance is Important

1. **Bridging the Financial Gap**:
   The current financial support from developed nations falls short of the needs estimated for effective climate action in developing countries. Without adequate funding, these nations may struggle to meet their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and implement ambitious climate projects.

2. **Technology Transfer and Capacity Building**:
   Climate finance isn't just about funding; it also encompasses the transfer of technology and capacity-building initiatives. Access to modern, low-emission technologies and the technical know-how to implement them are crucial for India to decarbonize its economy and improve adaptation capabilities.

3. **Resilience and Adaptation**:
   India faces significant climate vulnerabilities, including extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and changes in monsoon patterns. Finance aimed at building infrastructure resilience and adaptive capacities is critical for protecting communities and sustaining economic growth.

### Way Forward for India and Developing Countries

1. **Strengthening Diplomatic Channels**:
   India must continue to use its influence in platforms such as the G-77 and China, the BASIC group (Brazil, South Africa, India, and China), and bilateral dialogues to advocate for clear commitments from developed countries regarding climate finance. Coordinated strategies with other developing nations can amplify their collective voice in demanding adherence to financial pledges.

2. **Accountability and Transparency**:
   India should push for greater transparency and accountability mechanisms at COP-29. This includes clear timelines and pathways for developed countries to meet their financial commitments. A robust system for tracking and reporting the disbursement and effectiveness of climate finance would ensure that the promised funds are directed where they are most needed.

3. **Leveraging Multilateral Institutions**:
   Engaging with global financial institutions such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the Green Climate Fund (GCF) is essential. India can advocate for these institutions to play a larger role in mobilizing and channeling climate finance toward developing countries.

4. **Domestic Policy Alignments**:
   While India emphasizes international finance, it should simultaneously strengthen domestic policies to attract investments and efficiently use the resources it receives. Initiatives such as the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) and various state action plans should be aligned to maximize the impact of international funding.

5. **Public-Private Partnerships (PPP)**:
   India can encourage public-private partnerships that leverage international finance to catalyze domestic investment in green technologies and sustainable projects. By creating favorable policies for investors, India can attract foreign investments that complement climate finance from developed countries.

6. **Enhancing Green Bonds and Innovative Financing**:
   India should continue to expand its green bonds market and explore innovative financing mechanisms. This would help bridge the gap between the actual financial requirements for climate action and the support provided by developed nations.

### Conclusion

As COP-29 approaches, India’s focus on climate finance is timely and justified. Developed countries must fulfill their Paris Agreement obligations to mobilize significant financial resources, enabling developing nations to contribute effectively to global climate action while maintaining sustainable development goals. The way forward involves a combination of strong diplomatic advocacy, transparent financial tracking, leveraging global financial institutions, and creating policies that attract further investment. By doing so, India can ensure it is well-positioned to achieve its climate goals and strengthen its leadership role among developing nations in the global climate discourse.

> Ahead of COP-29, India’s emphasis on securing climate finance from developed countries aligns with the Paris Agreement's mandate for $100 billion in annual support to developing nations, a target not fully met. This finance is crucial for India to meet its climate commitments, scale renewable energy, bolster infrastructure resilience, and support economic growth while addressing climate vulnerabilities. India highlights the principle of *Common But Differentiated Responsibilities* to stress developed nations’ historical emissions and responsibility. Moving forward, India should enhance diplomatic advocacy, promote transparency in funding, leverage multilateral institutions, align domestic policies, and encourage public-private partnerships for sustainable climate finance.

# Ransomware attack hit crucial defence unit last year: DoPT

The 2023-24 annual report of the Department of Personnel Training (DoPT) revealed a significant cybersecurity breach involving a ransomware attack on a crucial defence unit in India. This incident highlighted the growing vulnerability of key government and defence sectors to sophisticated cyberattacks. A ransomware attack involves malicious software that encrypts data on a computer system, blocking user access until a ransom is paid to the attackers. The report did not disclose the specific location or details of the impacted defence unit but pointed out that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) was actively involved in investigating this and other serious cybercrimes that posed threats to national security.

### Cybersecurity Landscape in 2023

The ransomware attack on the defence unit was not an isolated incident. The report detailed a series of other significant cybersecurity threats, including a data breach that compromised the personal information of millions of Indian citizens, a malware attack on a government ministry, and a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack targeting critical infrastructure and airports across the country. DDoS attacks aim to overwhelm servers and disrupt regular internet traffic, causing widespread service interruptions.

These incidents occurred during a year when India was hosting the G-20 conference, drawing global attention and potentially making it a higher-value target for cybercriminals and state-sponsored attackers. The surge in cyberattacks underscores the evolving nature of digital threats, as both the frequency and complexity of these incidents have been increasing.

### Surge in Cybercrime Statistics

Data from the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) for 2023 reflected the dramatic rise in cyber incidents. The number of reported security breaches in 2023 was 15,92,917, marking a significant increase from the 53,117 incidents reported in 2017. This sharp rise in cyber threats includes website intrusions, malware propagation, phishing scams, website defacements, unauthorized network scans, data breaches, and ransomware attacks. The scale of this increase emphasizes the urgent need for robust cybersecurity measures and an enhanced response framework.

CERT-In, the national nodal agency for responding to computer security incidents, has been proactive in recommending remedial actions. These solutions are implemented in collaboration with relevant stakeholders, including government departments, private organizations, and critical infrastructure operators. However, the sheer scale and sophistication of cyberattacks require continuous improvements in detection, prevention, and response strategies.

### High-Profile Data Breaches and International Collaboration

In addition to the ransomware attack on the defence unit, the year 2023 witnessed other high-profile data breaches. Notably, American cybersecurity firm Resecurity reported in October 2023 that the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had suffered a data leak affecting the Aadhaar and passport details of 81 crore Indian citizens. The breach included names, phone numbers, and addresses, presenting significant risks of identity theft and fraudulent activities. Such large-scale data breaches highlight the vulnerabilities within critical data storage and management systems, emphasizing the need for stronger data protection regulations and practices.

The CBI’s role in countering these cyber threats extended beyond national borders. The agency worked closely with international counterparts such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), and Singapore police to dismantle call centre fraud networks in India. These partnerships are crucial for addressing cross-border cybercrime and dismantling organized cybercriminal operations. Collaboration with international law enforcement agencies enhances the capabilities of Indian authorities to track, apprehend, and prosecute cybercriminals operating globally.

### Challenges and the Path Forward

The surge in cyberattacks presents several challenges for India. First, the rapid pace of technological change means that cybercriminals constantly develop new tools and tactics. Defence, government, and critical infrastructure sectors need to stay ahead of these developments with state-of-the-art cybersecurity technologies, real-time monitoring, and robust response protocols.

Second, human error remains a significant factor in cybersecurity breaches. Training programs to improve cyber hygiene and awareness among employees, government officials, and the general public are essential to reduce vulnerabilities. Regular audits, penetration testing, and stringent access controls can help secure sensitive systems.

Third, legislative and policy frameworks need to be strengthened to adapt to the dynamic nature of cyber threats. The introduction and enforcement of stringent data protection laws, clear guidelines for data handling, and mandatory breach reporting requirements will improve transparency and accountability.

### Conclusion

The ransomware attack on a defence unit in 2023 and the significant rise in other cyber incidents reveal the urgent need for comprehensive cybersecurity measures in India. The CBI’s involvement, along with international collaborations, reflects the growing recognition that tackling cybercrime requires coordinated efforts both within and outside national borders. Moving forward, enhancing technological capabilities, fostering international partnerships, strengthening legal frameworks, and investing in public and employee training will be vital to safeguarding India’s national security and protecting its critical infrastructure from future cyber threats.

India faces significant cybersecurity challenges as digital adoption accelerates, exposing critical infrastructure, government departments, and citizens to potential cyber threats. Key challenges include increasing frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks, data breaches, ransomware, phishing, and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. The rapid evolution of cyber tools used by adversaries, the complexity of securing vast and varied digital landscapes, and vulnerabilities due to human error exacerbate these risks.

### Key Cybersecurity Challenges

1. **Ransomware Attacks**: The threat of ransomware has grown, targeting critical sectors such as government, defence, and healthcare. Attacks lock critical systems until a ransom is paid, disrupting operations and compromising sensitive data.
2. **Data Breaches**: Incidents involving large-scale data breaches, like the reported leak of Aadhaar and passport details of 81 crore citizens in 2023, pose significant risks to individual privacy and national security.
3. **Phishing and Malware**: Sophisticated phishing schemes and malware propagation impact government agencies, businesses, and individuals, leading to financial and data losses.
4. **DDoS Attacks**: These attacks, which overwhelm servers to disrupt internet traffic, target essential services, including airports and government portals, crippling operations and service delivery.
5. **Legacy Systems and Infrastructure**: Many government departments and organizations use outdated systems that are more vulnerable to cyberattacks.
6. **Lack of Cyber Awareness**: Insufficient awareness among employees and the public about cybersecurity best practices increases the risk of breaches due to human error.

### Indian Government’s Initiatives to Tackle Cybersecurity Challenges

The Indian government has been proactive in responding to these threats by implementing various strategies, policies, and measures:

1. **CERT-In (Indian Computer Emergency Response Team)**:
   - **Role and Functions**: CERT-In serves as the national agency for incident response, providing advisories, coordinating remediation, and monitoring cyber threats.
   - **Remedial Measures**: CERT-In collaborates with stakeholders to handle incidents and ensures the implementation of recommended solutions. It also issues alerts and guidelines to enhance cyber resilience.

2. **National Cyber Security Policy**:
   - **Framework and Goals**: India’s National Cyber Security Policy, initially drafted in 2013 and currently undergoing updates, outlines measures to protect public and private infrastructure. The policy aims to create a secure cyber ecosystem, encourage compliance, and promote collaborative measures between government and private sectors.
   - **Strengthening Legal Frameworks**: The proposed Personal Data Protection Bill and amendments to the IT Act aim to modernize data protection laws and impose stricter controls on data handling and breach notifications.

3. **International Collaborations**:
   - **Global Partnerships**: The Indian government partners with international cybersecurity organizations and law enforcement agencies such as the FBI, Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), and other global entities to combat cross-border cybercrime and share intelligence.
   - **Collaborative Exercises**: India participates in joint cyber drills and exercises to strengthen preparedness and response mechanisms.

4. **Capacity Building and Training**:
   - **Cyber Awareness Campaigns**: Government initiatives focus on increasing awareness about safe online practices, targeted at employees and the general public.
   - **Skill Development Programs**: The government supports training programs aimed at enhancing the technical skills of cybersecurity professionals through partnerships with educational institutions and tech organizations.

# Team India will not play in Pakistan, BCCI tells ICC

India’s decision to withdraw from the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy set to be held in Pakistan could have significant repercussions on the already strained relations between the two countries. The Board of Control for Cricket in India’s (BCCI) official communication to the International Cricket Council (ICC) stating that the Indian team will not participate in the tournament in Pakistan, despite assurances of special security arrangements from the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), reflects deeper political and security concerns.

### Historical Context of India-Pakistan Cricket Relations

Cricket has long been a shared passion between India and Pakistan, often serving as a cultural and diplomatic bridge amid political tensions. Matches between the two nations are highly anticipated events, drawing millions of viewers and generating significant revenue. Historically, cricket diplomacy has been used as a means to foster engagement; for example, the series played during the 2004 and 2005 seasons helped ease tensions and provided a platform for dialogue. However, relations between the two countries have been marked by periodic crises, stemming from long-standing disputes over issues like Kashmir, cross-border terrorism, and geopolitical conflicts.

### Impact of the BCCI’s Decision

India’s decision to skip the Champions Trophy sends a clear signal that political and security concerns outweigh the potential benefits of participating in sporting events hosted by Pakistan. This move could deepen the mistrust between the two nations, as cricket has often been one of the few non-political arenas where cooperation was possible. Pakistan may view India’s decision as a political gesture rather than one solely based on security concerns, potentially interpreting it as an effort to isolate or delegitimize them in the international sports community.

From Pakistan's perspective, the ICC Champions Trophy was an opportunity to demonstrate its ability to host major international tournaments safely, which would bolster its reputation and confidence after years of international teams avoiding playing in the country due to security concerns. The PCB's efforts to convince India, including offering to play matches at venues selected by India and promising special security protocols, highlight the importance they placed on India's participation for the success and credibility of the event.

### Diplomatic and Bilateral Repercussions

India's refusal could have broader diplomatic implications. The decision underscores the hardline approach taken by India concerning cross-border relations and signals that, despite attempts at engagement and assurances, trust remains elusive. In response, Pakistan may take retaliatory measures, such as avoiding participation in events hosted by India or leveraging diplomatic forums to highlight the perceived politicization of sports by India.

The move also impacts opportunities for engagement between the two countries. Cricket has served as an informal channel for dialogue and cultural exchange, offering moments of reduced tension. With India’s absence, this avenue is effectively closed, reducing chances for non-political interactions that could potentially pave the way for improved relations.

### Economic and Strategic Implications

India’s non-participation may also have financial implications for the tournament and the ICC. The Indian cricket team's games attract a global audience and generate significant broadcasting revenue. Without India's participation, the Champions Trophy could face reduced viewership and commercial losses. This could lead to discussions within the ICC about the viability of major international tournaments being hosted in politically sensitive regions.

### Conclusion

India’s decision to withdraw from the Champions Trophy in Pakistan highlights the complex interplay between sports and politics in the subcontinent. While security and political concerns are valid, this move diminishes the potential for cricket to act as a tool for soft diplomacy and cultural engagement. The fallout may lead to further isolation, increased mistrust, and a continuation of the status quo in India-Pakistan relations, where opportunities for dialogue and cooperation remain limited. The decision underscores the enduring challenges both nations face in balancing national security with the broader benefits of regional engagement and sportsmanship.

> India’s decision to withdraw from the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy in Pakistan could strain already tense India-Pakistan relations. Cricket has historically served as a bridge for dialogue, but this move underscores deeper political and security concerns. Pakistan may perceive India’s withdrawal as a political statement rather than a security measure, potentially escalating bilateral tensions. The decision diminishes cricket’s role as a tool for cultural and diplomatic engagement, reducing opportunities for informal interaction. Additionally, the absence of India’s participation could financially impact the tournament due to decreased viewership. This highlights the complex relationship between sports, politics, and regional diplomacy.

# FM tells RRBs to develop products for MSMEs

Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) play a significant role in supporting Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in India. This relationship is crucial for economic development and financial inclusion. The Finance Minister’s call for RRBs and their sponsor banks to develop products tailored to MSME clusters underscores the importance of this sector in enhancing banking outreach and contributing to India's growth.

### Role of RRBs in Supporting MSMEs

1. **Providing Accessible Credit**: RRBs are key players in providing affordable and accessible credit to rural and semi-urban areas where MSMEs often operate. These enterprises usually lack the financial stability and creditworthiness needed for loans from larger commercial banks. RRBs bridge this gap by offering customized financial products that cater to the unique needs of MSMEs, such as working capital loans, term loans, and micro-financing.

2. **Promoting Financial Inclusion**: RRBs help bring financial services to the underbanked and unbanked populations. By extending their reach to remote and rural areas, they make it possible for MSMEs in these regions to access banking facilities, thereby fostering financial inclusion. This, in turn, enables MSMEs to formalize their businesses, improve credit profiles, and integrate into the larger financial ecosystem.

3. **Supporting Cluster Development**: Many MSMEs are part of industry clusters that specialize in specific products or services, such as textiles, handicrafts, or agricultural processing. RRBs, by developing financial products targeted at these clusters, can facilitate the growth of specialized industries. This targeted support helps MSMEs scale operations, access new technologies, and improve productivity, contributing to regional economic development.

4. **Capacity Building and Financial Literacy**: RRBs, often with the support of their sponsor banks, also engage in initiatives that promote financial literacy and entrepreneurship training for MSMEs. These programs help business owners understand financial management, credit processes, and strategies for scaling up their enterprises.

### How MSMEs Contribute to India’s Development

1. **Driving Economic Growth**: MSMEs are vital to India’s economy, contributing about 30% of the GDP and employing over 110 million people. They play a significant role in industrial output and exports, accounting for around 45% of total exports. By stimulating economic activity at the grassroots level, MSMEs create a robust foundation for sustainable growth.

2. **Employment Generation**: One of the most critical contributions of MSMEs is job creation. In a developing country like India, where a significant portion of the population resides in rural and semi-urban areas, MSMEs provide employment opportunities close to home. This helps curb urban migration and supports balanced regional development.

3. **Innovation and Entrepreneurship**: MSMEs often foster innovation due to their adaptability and ability to respond quickly to market needs. They are breeding grounds for entrepreneurs who contribute fresh ideas and products to the economy. Encouraging MSME growth thus supports a culture of innovation that is essential for India’s progress as a developed economy.

4. **Promoting Balanced Regional Development**: By setting up operations in rural and semi-urban areas, MSMEs help distribute economic growth more evenly across the country. This reduces the concentration of wealth and development in major cities, supporting regional balance and reducing income inequality.

5. **Building a Resilient Supply Chain**: MSMEs are critical to larger industries by functioning as suppliers, vendors, and service providers. Their growth strengthens domestic supply chains, making the economy less dependent on imports and more resilient to global disruptions. This helps build a self-sustaining economy in line with the ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ (Self-Reliant India) vision.

### Way Forward

For India to leverage the full potential of MSMEs, continuous support through improved access to finance, better infrastructure, and digitalization is essential. The Finance Minister’s push for RRBs and sponsor banks to develop products that align with MSME clusters is a step in the right direction. Tailored financial solutions, combined with policy support and capacity-building initiatives, can empower MSMEs to expand, innovate, and contribute significantly to India’s journey toward becoming a developed nation.

By strengthening the role of RRBs and fostering a robust MSME sector, India can ensure inclusive growth, widespread job creation, and sustained economic development.
