# Manipur as a case for imposing Article 356

### President's Rule and Article 356 of the Indian Constitution

**President's Rule**, formally known as State Emergency or Constitutional Emergency, refers to a situation where the governance of a state is taken over by the President of India. This is invoked under **Article 356** of the Indian Constitution when the constitutional machinery in a state breaks down, and the state government cannot function in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.

---

### **What is Article 356?**
Article 356 empowers the President of India to assume direct control of a state in case of failure of its constitutional machinery. This provision is designed to safeguard the unity and integrity of the country by ensuring that states operate within the constitutional framework.

#### **Conditions for Invocation of Article 356:**
1. The President is satisfied, either based on a report from the Governor or "otherwise," that the state government cannot function as per the Constitution.
2. This may arise due to:
   - Breakdown of law and order.
   - Political instability or lack of majority in the state legislature.
   - Failure to comply with constitutional directives from the Union.
   - Any other extraordinary situation where governance is paralyzed.

#### **Procedure:**
1. **Governor’s Report**: Normally, the Governor sends a report to the President detailing the situation in the state.
2. **Presidential Proclamation**: The President issues a proclamation under Article 356, subject to parliamentary approval.
3. **Parliamentary Approval**: The proclamation must be approved by both Houses of Parliament within two months.
4. **Duration**: Initially valid for six months, it can be extended up to three years with parliamentary approval every six months.

---

### **Impact of President's Rule**
- **State Administration**:
  - The Governor acts on behalf of the President and assumes the executive authority of the state.
  - The state legislature is either dissolved or kept in suspended animation.
  - The Union Government advises the Governor in administering the state.

- **Role of Central Government**:
  - The central government takes charge of the state's legislative and administrative functions.
  - It ensures that constitutional governance is restored at the earliest.

---

### **Cases of President’s Rule**
President’s Rule has been imposed in India multiple times since Independence. While it is a necessary provision to maintain constitutional governance, its use has sometimes been controversial, especially when politically motivated. Some landmark instances include:
1. **Kerala (1959)**: Dismissal of the first Communist government in Kerala under Article 356.
2. **Bihar (2005)**: Invoked due to political instability after no party could form a government.
3. **Punjab (1987)**: Imposed during a period of severe internal disturbances.

---

### **Manipur: A Case for Article 356**
The ongoing violence and unrest in Manipur since May 2023 exemplify a constitutional breakdown. The inability of the state government to restore law and order, ensure security, and protect citizens’ rights has raised serious concerns. Invoking Article 356 in such a scenario can provide:
1. **Restoration of Law and Order**: Direct control by the President may help stabilize the situation.
2. **Neutral Administration**: Central governance may reduce political bias in addressing the crisis.
3. **Protection of Constitutional Values**: Ensures that governance aligns with the Constitution.

---

### **Criticism of President’s Rule**
1. **Political Misuse**: In some cases, Article 356 has been used as a tool to dismiss opposition-led state governments.
2. **Erosion of Federalism**: Overuse or misuse undermines the federal structure of the Constitution.
3. **Judicial Oversight**: The Supreme Court, in the **S.R. Bommai vs Union of India (1994)** case, ruled that the use of Article 356 is subject to judicial review, ensuring it is not arbitrarily applied.

---

### **Safeguards and Recommendations**
1. **Governor’s Role**: Governors should provide unbiased and factual reports to prevent misuse of Article 356.
2. **Judicial Review**: Courts should continue to monitor the imposition of President’s Rule to prevent its arbitrary use.
3. **Strengthening Federalism**: Political differences should not lead to the dismissal of state governments.

---

### **Conclusion**
President’s Rule under Article 356 is an essential provision for maintaining constitutional governance in states during crises. However, its application should be a last resort and must be guided by constitutional principles, not political motivations. In cases like Manipur, where governance has failed and violence persists, invoking Article 356 may help restore stability and uphold the rule of law. The balance between federalism and unity must remain central to its implementation.

> President’s Rule, invoked under Article 356 of the Indian Constitution, allows the President to assume control of a state when its constitutional machinery breaks down. Triggered by a Governor’s report or the President's satisfaction, it is approved by Parliament and lasts for up to three years with periodic reviews. During this period, the Governor administers the state, advised by the Union Government. While it ensures governance during crises like political instability or lawlessness, its misuse has sparked criticism for undermining federalism. In Manipur's ongoing unrest since May 2023, invoking Article 356 could restore law and order, ensuring constitutional governance.

# As Delhi chokes, SC orders all curbs to stay till it lifts them; slams CAQM for delayed action

### Supreme Court Criticizes Delayed Action on Air Pollution in Delhi

The Supreme Court of India has taken a strong stance against the delayed actions of the Commission on Air Quality Management (CAQM) in addressing the alarming levels of air pollution in Delhi. As the national capital continues to grapple with hazardous air quality, the apex court directed that **Stage IV** of the **Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP)** should remain in force even if the Air Quality Index (AQI) marginally improves and falls below the “severe-plus” threshold of 450.

---

### **Background: The Air Pollution Crisis**

Delhi and the surrounding National Capital Region (NCR) face recurring air pollution crises, especially during the winter months. Factors contributing to this include:
1. **Vehicular Emissions**: The heavy density of vehicles significantly contributes to particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10).
2. **Industrial Pollution**: Factories and thermal power plants emit harmful gases and particulates.
3. **Stubble Burning**: Seasonal crop residue burning in neighboring states exacerbates the problem.
4. **Construction Activities**: Dust from construction sites adds to particulate pollution.
5. **Climatic Conditions**: Cooler temperatures and low wind speeds trap pollutants close to the ground.

The AQI in Delhi frequently enters the “severe” or “severe-plus” category, posing severe health risks, especially for vulnerable populations like children, the elderly, and those with respiratory issues.

---

### **Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP)**

GRAP is a set of emergency measures introduced in 2017 to combat air pollution in Delhi-NCR. It comprises four stages, with escalating responses based on the AQI levels:

1. **Stage I (AQI 201-300)**: Moderate pollution; measures include curbing waste burning and increasing public transport services.
2. **Stage II (AQI 301-400)**: Poor air quality; restrictions on diesel generators and enforcement of construction guidelines.
3. **Stage III (AQI 401-450)**: Very poor air quality; bans on construction activities and industrial operations using non-clean fuels.
4. **Stage IV (AQI 450+)**: Severe-plus air quality; bans on private vehicles, halting construction activities, and shutting schools and offices.

---

### **Supreme Court's Directive**

The Supreme Court criticized the CAQM for its delayed action, arguing that the damage caused by air pollution required immediate and sustained responses. It instructed that Stage IV measures under GRAP must continue even if the AQI marginally improves and drops below the "severe-plus" threshold. This decision emphasizes the need for proactive and preventive measures to address chronic pollution rather than reacting only when the situation becomes critical.

---

### **Impact of Stage IV Measures**

1. **Immediate Impact**:
   - Banning private vehicles will reduce vehicular emissions.
   - Halting construction and industrial activities will curb dust and harmful emissions.
   - Closing schools and offices will protect vulnerable groups and reduce overall activity.

2. **Long-Term Impact**:
   - Sustained enforcement of stringent measures may encourage cleaner practices in industries and construction.
   - Reduced reliance on private vehicles could increase the adoption of public transport and electric vehicles.

---

### **Need for Sustainable Solutions**

While GRAP provides an emergency framework, experts argue for long-term solutions to address Delhi’s chronic air pollution:
- **Improving Public Transport**: Expanding metro and bus networks to reduce vehicular emissions.
- **Cleaner Fuels**: Promoting renewable energy and cleaner industrial fuels.
- **Stubble Management**: Offering incentives for farmers to adopt alternatives to stubble burning.
- **Public Awareness**: Encouraging individual actions like carpooling and reducing energy consumption.

---

### **Conclusion**

The Supreme Court’s intervention underscores the urgency of addressing Delhi’s pollution crisis. By mandating continued implementation of Stage IV GRAP measures, the Court has signaled the need for a stricter and more proactive approach to combat air pollution. However, sustainable solutions and systemic changes are essential to ensure long-term improvement in air quality. This crisis demands collective efforts from the government, industries, and citizens alike.

> The Supreme Court criticized the Commission on Air Quality Management (CAQM) for delayed action as Delhi faced severe pollution, directing that **Stage IV** measures of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) remain in effect even if the Air Quality Index (AQI) drops below the "severe-plus" level of 450. Stage IV includes bans on private vehicles, construction, and industrial activities, aiming to reduce emissions immediately. While the court’s directive emphasizes urgency, experts highlight the need for long-term solutions, such as improving public transport, promoting clean fuels, managing stubble burning, and raising public awareness, to tackle Delhi’s recurring air pollution crisis effectively.

# How sustainable is India’s path to net-zero with 45 years left?

Every year, climate action draws significant attention in the months leading up to the United Nations’ annual meeting of the **Conference of the Parties (COPs)**. But the outcome of the 2024 U.S. presidential election will likely have a greater impact on the planet’s climate future than COP-29 itself, illustrating an important challenge in combating climate change: operationalising global cooperation towards a common cause even when national interests don’t align with it.

For example, an economically developed country with sufficient resources per capita may not find it necessary to change course — whereas a populous and developing country like India will. A few COPs ago, India committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2070. Since then, it has implemented several policies while others are in the works to support this transition. It is widely acknowledged that this journey will not be without challenges, especially financial ones. However, other resource constraints such as land or water availability also matter, limiting the choices available for a sustainable long-term pathway for India.

### Why net-zero at all?

With each passing day, climate change is becoming more evident. The scientific consensus is that to avoid devastating and irreversible consequences, the world must keep the global average annual surface temperature rise to within 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels. The current increase is at least 1.1 °C over that in 1880.

The **Sixth Assessment Report of the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change** estimated that from 2020, the remaining (cumulative) global carbon budget for a 50-67% chance of limiting temperature rise to 1.5 °C is 400-500 billion tonnes (Gt) of CO2. Currently, annual global emissions are around 40 GtCO₂.

This means net global emissions must drop drastically to stay within the carbon budget. Several countries have announced net-zero targets, but we also really need a sharp decline in total emissions.

### Is net-zero equitable?

The developed world, having caused the problem of climate change in the first place, is expected to lead this transition and reach net-zero emissions well before 2050, allowing more time for developing countries to balance their development goals with climate action. These expectations aren’t being met, however.

Developed countries are also expected to help finance climate action, but this hasn’t materialised at the required scale either. Developing countries, especially those that are small islands, are bearing more than their fair share of the brunt of climate change.

So overall, neither climate change nor climate action is currently equitable. COP-29 is expected to build consensus on the level of financing required.

India’s per-capita emissions are among the lowest in the world. However, according to the World Inequality Database, the per-capita emissions of the richest 10% are 20-times greater than that of the poorest 10% and in absolute terms almost half of the country’s total. Climate change more severely affects the economically weaker sections.

India’s size and diversity mean it’s a country of countries, and some of them are more polluting than others vis-à-vis the climate. Importantly, India lacks the carrying capacity to support the developed world’s lifestyle standards for its entire population. If it should, India will run into significant food shortage due to groundwater depletion by the 2040s, extreme heat stress in urban areas due to the ever-increasing vehicular pollution and AC use, irreversible biodiversity loss due to non-ideal land-use changes encroaching on habitats, etc.

India’s lifestyle aspirations could easily become unsustainable in the long run, jeopardising our access to basic needs.

### A new consumption corridor

In a scenario where consumption rises unchecked and India electrifies all end-use applications, the power demand could increase nine- to ten-fold by 2070. Meeting it entirely via renewable energy will require more than 5,500 GW of solar and 1,500 GW of wind, up from the current 70 GW and and 47 GW, respectively.

This target is achievable if India’s only priority is to expand renewable energy generation capacity. But if India is to maintain food and nutritional security, increase forest cover, and preserve biodiversity as well, these energy targets will become very challenging. By modelling land-use change dynamics over time, the authors have found going beyond 3,500 GW solar and 900 GW wind will demand considerable land trade-offs.

In sum, India has a tough balancing act to pull off: availing good quality of life to a large share of its population (which has significant material and energy implications) while working towards its climate adaptation and mitigation goals.

To this end, it is important to recognise the pitfalls of economic models. For example, the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesises that beyond a threshold, economic growth can be decoupled from carbon emissions. In reality, even the richest countries haven’t achieved this decoupling (other than by shifting their emissions to poorer countries). This is why it is in our best interest to not aspire to achieve the lifestyle standards of the west.

Instead, we need to envisage a long-term strategy incorporating ‘sufficiency consumption corridors’, with a floor well suited to meeting our developmental goals and a ceiling of excess that will help avoid unsustainable growth. Equally, if not more, important are demand-side measures to help maintain this corridor of consumption that will keep us on a sustainable pathway.

Our power consumption here could increase six- or sevenfold by 2070.

### Demand and supply measures

Some of these demand-side measures include the use of better construction materials and passive design elements to provide thermal comfort that doesn’t require air-conditioning, energy-efficient appliances, public and/or non-motorised transport within urban areas and railways for intercity travel, local products to reduce the demand for long-haul freight, mindful dietary choices, and alternative fuels in industries in addition to some electrification.

On the supply side as well, India needs to further decentralise energy production (including by the use of rooftop solar cells and of solar pumps for agriculture). Finally, it should continue to expand its nuclear power generation capacity to diversify its energy mix and to complement a grid becoming more dependent on intermittent energy sources. Nuclear power could also offer a precious low-carbon baseload energy and help the government effectively phase out the national economy’s dependence on fossil fuels.

As the world trundles towards its net-zero and other climate-related targets, the leeway for governments to miss some of them or postpone their achievement also shrinks. Of course some things are out of our control — for example who becomes the U.S. President — but the things that we can we must, before we cannot.

> India's path to achieving net-zero emissions by 2070, with 45 years remaining, hinges on balancing economic growth with sustainability. The nation is making strides through renewable energy expansion, aiming for 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030, and promoting electric mobility, hydrogen energy, and energy efficiency. Challenges include reliance on coal, high population growth, and funding needs for green technologies. Successful policy implementation, global support through climate finance and technology transfer, and public-private collaboration are essential. While progress is evident, consistent efforts in decarbonization and resilience-building are critical to ensure a sustainable and achievable journey to net-zero.

# How can design help a building be more climate-resilient?

High-performance buildings (HPBs) are at the forefront of sustainable construction, tackling urgent needs like energy efficiency, climate resilience and resource conservation. As climate change intensifies, resources become scarcer, and urbanisation increases, HPBs — built to consume less energy, conserve resources, and withstand unpredictable weather — are an important part of achieving and keeping sustainable living.

Building an HPB requires key practices such as integrative design, lifecycle-based materials, efficient energy and water management, performance monitoring, and climate-resilient features.

### What is integrative design?

At the core of HPBs is an integrative design approach that encourages architects, engineers, sustainability consultants, and building owners to work together and set measurable performance goals. These goals might aim for, say, 90% daylighting in occupied spaces or cooling in 700 sq. ft. per tonne of air-conditioning in commercial buildings. This approach ensures all building systems — air-conditioning, lighting, and building envelope components like walls, roofs, and windows — work together smoothly.

Digital modelling also plays a crucial role by creating a virtual representation of the project, allowing the team to predict performance outcomes, guide optimal system sizing, and test different strategies. With simulations, the team can adjust their strategies to meet energy-saving and thermal comfort goals before construction even begins. This predictive approach helps achieve high operational efficiency, improves resilience, and reduces long-term costs.

An example of an integrative design process in HPBs is the early use of passive design strategies, whereby designers make the most of natural sunlight and plan to use materials that retain heat (thermal mass). These strategies reduce heating and cooling demands, allowing designers to choose equipment of the right size.

### What makes materials sustainable?

Materials need to be durable, energy-efficient, and prioritise occupant health. HPBs in particular prefer materials with low embodied carbon (emissions produced during manufacturing) and high recycled content. A life-cycle assessment is often used to evaluate a material’s environmental impact and reveal the most sustainable options.

Additionally, HPBs use low-emission interior materials to improve indoor air quality by reducing the concentration of volatile organic compounds (harmful substances that can easily evaporate into the air). This creates a healthier environment for occupants and improves building performance.

For example, for the upcoming Indian Institute of Human Settlements (IIHS) campus in Bengaluru, planners are using a life-cycle cost analysis to evaluate materials for comfort, durability, and the cost of envelope materials, including their impact on cooling equipment size and energy use over 50 years.

### How can buildings use less energy?

Buildings account for about 40% of the total energy consumption of 580 million terajoules — equivalent to 13,865 million tonnes of oil over their lifespans, primarily for operational needs. Reducing this demand requires both passive and active strategies.

Passive design strategies tap into natural light, optimise building orientation, and take advantage of thermal mass to reduce the need for artificial lighting, heating, and cooling. These strategies must be tailored to the local climate and the building’s specific needs, ensuring efficient operation without heavy reliance on mechanical systems.

On the active side, HPBs use energy-efficient HVAC systems, lighting, and appliances supported by smart technologies like automated lighting control and occupancy sensors that allow real-time energy monitoring and optimisation. The Infosys Hyderabad campus was India’s first HPB to have a radiant cooling HVAC system that combines daylighting controls and task-lighting to minimise energy use.

A key goal for HPBs is net-zero energy, a.k.a. net-positive energy performance: they generate as much or more energy than they consume. Advances in affordable solar and wind technology make it easier to achieve this goal and reduce fossil fuel use.

### How do HPBs save water?

Water scarcity is a critical issue nationwide, and HPBs address it by conserving and reusing water and fine-tuning quality. Efficient fixtures like low-flow faucets and dual-flush toilets reduce water use while rainwater harvesting apparatuses collect rainwater for non-potable uses like irrigation and sanitation.

On-site wastewater treatment systems also increase efficiency by recycling greywater for irrigation and treating blackwater with biological systems like constructed wetlands and sewage treatment plants. HPBs also incorporate green infrastructure elements such as permeable paving and bioswales to manage stormwater and cool urban heat-islands. Infosys campuses in India, for example, recycle 100% of their wastewater using a water management system and aerobic membrane bioreactor, earning them zero-discharge status.

### Why is monitoring important?

Performance monitoring helps ensure an HPB meets design goals and operates efficiently. Using advanced monitoring systems, an HPB tracks energy consumption, water use, and indoor environmental quality in real-time. This data helps facility managers identify inefficiencies and implement corrective action. Continuous performance assessments can also validate the design and inform future projects.

For example, the second annexe of the IIHS Bengaluru campus uses a network of smart devices plus controls linked to an artificial intelligence to optimise thermal regulation.

### How can HPBs handle climate risks?

HPBs are built to withstand unpredictable weather like extreme heat and flash floods — beginning with careful site selection and flood protection measures. Durable materials and diverse energy systems enhance structural resilience while passive survivability ensures the structures are habitable even during a power outage. Renewable energy systems also provide backup power, and rainwater harvesting and onsite treatment systems ensure water doesn’t run low.

For example, the Infosys Crescent building in Bengaluru is designed to use far less energy than typical office buildings. It serves about 8,000 people and uses only 75 kWh of energy per sq.m each year, while most offices use between 150 and 200 kWh. With 90% of the space air-conditioned, the building’s advanced cooling system requires 3 W per sq. ft versus the usual 4-5 W in regular offices. This shows how smart design can save energy and reduce costs without increasing building expenses.

Taken together, HPBs set the standard for buildings this century and benchmarks for sustainability and resilient built-environments. In addition to their benefits for the climate and lowering operational costs, they improve real estate value. As the practices underlying their construction and operation become more widespread, the goal should be to make all buildings HPBs.

> Climate-resilient building design integrates features to withstand extreme weather while minimizing environmental impact. Strategies include using sustainable materials, designing for natural ventilation and daylighting, and incorporating green roofs and walls to manage heat and stormwater. Elevated structures and permeable pavements mitigate flooding risks, while reinforced construction enhances durability against storms. Renewable energy systems like solar panels and rainwater harvesting reduce reliance on external resources. Adaptive features, such as adjustable shading and flexible spaces, help buildings respond to varying climate conditions. These measures collectively enhance a building's ability to endure climate challenges, ensuring sustainability and long-term functionality.
