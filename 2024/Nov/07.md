# ₹50K reward to GPs that prevent child marriages by Karnataka Government

The initiative to offer a ₹50,000 reward to Gram Panchayats (GPs) that effectively prevent child marriages is a strategic move aimed at reinforcing grassroots efforts to combat this social issue. This scheme is part of broader government strategies focused on reducing child marriage rates, promoting gender equality, and improving the overall welfare of children, especially girls, in rural areas. Here’s a detailed explanation of the key aspects and implications of this initiative:

### 1. **Purpose and Motivation**
Child marriage remains a significant challenge in many parts of India, despite legal prohibitions and awareness campaigns. It disproportionately affects girls, leading to negative consequences such as school dropouts, early pregnancies, health complications, and perpetuation of poverty cycles. By offering a monetary reward to GPs, the government aims to incentivize local authorities to take proactive steps in preventing child marriages and protecting children’s rights.

### 2. **Role of Gram Panchayats**
Gram Panchayats are the foundational units of local self-governance in rural India, tasked with implementing development programs and maintaining social order within their communities. Given their direct interaction with the local population and understanding of community dynamics, GPs are well-positioned to influence attitudes and monitor activities related to child marriages. 

### 3. **Mechanics of the Reward System**
The ₹50,000 reward is intended as an incentive for GPs to actively engage in awareness and preventive measures:
   - **Awareness Campaigns**: GPs can organize educational programs, workshops, and community discussions to spread awareness about the harmful effects of child marriage and the legal consequences for those involved.
   - **Monitoring and Reporting**: GPs are expected to monitor their communities, maintain vigilance during peak wedding seasons, and report suspected cases to higher authorities.
   - **Coordination with Local Authorities**: GPs will work in collaboration with local police, NGOs, and child protection agencies to ensure that interventions are timely and effective.

### 4. **Criteria for Eligibility**
To qualify for the reward, GPs need to demonstrate tangible results in their fight against child marriage. This could include:
   - **Zero Incidents of Child Marriage**: Maintaining a record of no reported child marriages within their jurisdiction for a specified period.
   - **Active Prevention**: Evidence of stopping planned child marriages through timely intervention and public awareness.
   - **Community Engagement**: Documentation of efforts such as meetings and educational drives that involve local leaders, schools, and religious heads to promote the message.

### 5. **Benefits of the Scheme**
   - **Empowerment of Local Governance**: Providing financial incentives empowers GPs to take more responsibility and action in social matters, promoting a sense of ownership in tackling societal issues.
   - **Enhanced Community Participation**: Financial rewards can motivate community leaders and members to participate actively in prevention efforts, fostering a community-based approach to addressing child marriage.
   - **Support for Development Projects**: The reward can be used by GPs for development projects or activities that benefit the community, such as educational initiatives for girls or health and welfare programs.

### 6. **Potential Challenges**
   - **Verification and Accountability**: Ensuring that the reward is genuinely given to GPs that have actively prevented child marriages and not just based on underreporting is crucial. Proper mechanisms for monitoring and verification need to be in place.
   - **Sustainability of Efforts**: While financial rewards may motivate short-term action, creating sustainable change requires continuous education and addressing underlying causes such as poverty and lack of education.
   - **Resistance to Change**: Deep-rooted cultural norms and traditions that perpetuate child marriage may pose resistance. GPs need strong support from district and state-level authorities to overcome such challenges.

### 7. **Long-term Implications**
This reward scheme, if effectively implemented, could lead to a reduction in child marriages and pave the way for more comprehensive approaches to child welfare and gender equality. It can strengthen the role of GPs in social reform and showcase the importance of local governance in executing government programs. Furthermore, successful implementation can inspire similar strategies targeting other social issues like child labor and gender-based violence.

### Conclusion
The ₹50,000 reward to GPs for preventing child marriages is a well-intentioned initiative aimed at leveraging local governance to address a pervasive social issue. By incentivizing proactive measures and community engagement, the scheme seeks to empower GPs to act as catalysts for change. However, ensuring transparency, building long-term awareness, and tackling the root causes of child marriage are essential for sustained progress. This approach highlights the importance of local action in addressing complex social challenges and promoting a healthier, more equitable society for future generations.

> The ₹50,000 reward to Gram Panchayats (GPs) for preventing child marriages aims to motivate local efforts in combating this social issue. GPs, being grassroots governance bodies, can use this incentive to run awareness campaigns, monitor and report cases, and coordinate with authorities to stop child marriages. Eligibility for the reward requires GPs to maintain a record of zero incidents, demonstrate prevention efforts, and engage the community. While the scheme empowers local governance and promotes community participation, challenges include ensuring transparency, accurate reporting, and overcoming cultural resistance. Long-term success relies on sustained education and addressing root causes like poverty and lack of education.

# What Trump 2.0 means for India

Donald Trump’s return as U.S. President could lead to positive developments for India, particularly in trade, defense, and diplomatic areas. Trump has expressed a commitment to bolstering U.S.-India ties, which could include renewed negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement, expanded access to U.S. military hardware, and technology partnerships. Unlike under President Biden, India may face fewer critiques regarding democratic norms, press freedoms, or human rights issues. Trump’s focus is more likely on economic partnerships, such as encouraging India to invest in U.S. oil and LNG projects.

India’s relationship with the U.S. during Trump’s second term may also see support in matters concerning regional tensions. For example, Trump’s previous hard stance on Canada and willingness to crack down on Khalistani groups could work in India’s favor amidst its strained relations with Canada. Additionally, India may anticipate less U.S. pressure on reducing ties with Russia due to Trump’s interest in engaging with Russian leadership, which contrasts with Biden’s tougher stance.

However, there are potential areas of tension. Trump’s focus on trade protectionism could lead to renewed challenges over tariffs and trade disputes, as seen in his first term when India’s Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) status was revoked and counter-tariffs were imposed. His tendency to disclose or exaggerate private conversations with global leaders could lead to diplomatic discomfort, as seen in the past when he claimed that Prime Minister Modi had sought his mediation on Kashmir, a claim India denied. Another example includes his comment during the China border conflict in 2020, where he mentioned Modi being “not in a good mood,” which was also refuted by India.

India’s regional policies might see impacts as well. While Trump’s past approach included cutting aid to Pakistan and supporting India during conflicts, this could exacerbate challenges for Pakistan, potentially leading to difficulties with international financial support. Bangladesh, under Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus, who has Democratic Party connections, might face increased criticism, especially following Trump’s comments on the treatment of Hindu minorities in the country. Additionally, South Asian nations like Nepal, Bhutan, and the Maldives, which saw increased U.S. engagement under Biden, may experience less attention under Trump’s administration, affecting their geopolitical strategy.

In summary, Trump’s return could strengthen India-U.S. trade and defense ties while easing diplomatic tensions around rights and democracy. However, India must be prepared for potential challenges in trade negotiations and the unpredictability of Trump’s diplomacy. India’s neighbors may have mixed reactions, balancing concerns over aid and attention against potential strategic shifts in U.S. foreign policy.

> Donald Trump’s re-election could benefit India through stronger trade, defense ties, and reduced scrutiny on democratic and human rights issues. Trump is expected to revive talks on a Free Trade Agreement and support military and technology partnerships. However, potential challenges include his protectionist stance, which may lead to trade disputes and tariff conflicts, as seen in his first term. His unpredictable diplomatic style could cause discomfort, exemplified by past comments on Kashmir and China. Regionally, Pakistan may face reduced U.S. aid, while Bangladesh and smaller South Asian nations may see less U.S. engagement, altering regional dynamics and strategic relations.

# RNA editing is promising to go where DNA editing can’t

RNA editing is emerging as a groundbreaking tool with unique advantages over traditional DNA editing techniques, promising to address limitations and expand the scope of genetic therapy. While DNA editing, particularly using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, has revolutionized genetics and disease treatment, it comes with challenges such as permanent changes to the genome and potential off-target effects. RNA editing, on the other hand, offers a safer and more flexible alternative for precise gene modification without altering the underlying DNA sequence.

### Understanding RNA Editing

RNA editing is a process that changes the nucleotide sequence of RNA molecules post-transcription, allowing cells to produce proteins that differ from those encoded by the DNA. This editing occurs through enzyme-mediated processes such as adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing, facilitated by enzymes called ADARs (adenosine deaminases acting on RNA). This approach enables temporary and reversible changes in gene expression, allowing scientists to modulate protein production in a controlled manner.

Unlike DNA editing, RNA editing does not involve making permanent changes to the genetic code. This means that any unintended consequences can potentially be reversed by stopping the treatment, minimizing long-term risks. This is particularly advantageous when treating complex diseases or conducting therapeutic experiments where precision and reversibility are critical.

### Advantages of RNA Editing

1. **Reversibility and Safety**: RNA editing modifies the transcriptome (RNA) instead of the genome (DNA). This non-permanent alteration allows for the potential correction of any unintended effects, enhancing safety for clinical applications. If an edit results in an adverse effect, the treatment can be discontinued, and the RNA changes will degrade naturally as part of normal cell processes.
2. **Precision**: RNA editing enables the precise alteration of single nucleotides without the need to introduce double-strand breaks, which are a common aspect of DNA editing techniques. This reduces the risk of unintended mutations or genomic instability.
3. **Avoiding Immune Responses**: DNA editing methods can sometimes trigger immune responses because they involve foreign proteins and permanent genomic alterations. RNA editing, being more transient, may elicit a less aggressive immune response, making it suitable for therapeutic applications.
4. **Wide Range of Applications**: RNA editing has the potential to treat diseases where DNA editing is either too risky or impractical. This includes neurological disorders, certain metabolic diseases, and genetic conditions where the desired outcome can be achieved by modifying protein synthesis rather than altering the DNA sequence.

### Challenges and Ongoing Research

Despite its advantages, RNA editing is still a developing field and faces several challenges:
- **Delivery Systems**: Efficient delivery of RNA editing tools to specific cells and tissues is still an ongoing area of research. Scientists are exploring various methods, such as lipid nanoparticles and viral vectors, to ensure precise targeting and minimal side effects.
- **Editing Efficiency**: Achieving high editing accuracy and efficiency is crucial for successful therapeutic applications. While natural ADAR enzymes play a role, engineered versions are being developed to improve editing specificity and broaden the types of possible RNA edits.
- **Regulatory and Ethical Considerations**: As with any genetic technology, RNA editing raises questions about its long-term impacts, ethical use, and how regulations will be adapted to oversee its development and application.

### Future Potential

RNA editing is poised to complement DNA editing, offering new ways to treat diseases by precisely targeting RNA transcripts. This opens possibilities for conditions that are difficult to manage through DNA editing due to the permanent nature of genomic changes. Additionally, RNA editing can potentially be used in real-time adaptive treatments, responding dynamically to a patient's changing condition.

### Conclusion

RNA editing represents an innovative and promising frontier in genetic medicine. With its ability to provide precise, reversible modifications without permanent changes to the genome, it addresses significant limitations associated with DNA editing. As research progresses, RNA editing could revolutionize the treatment of genetic diseases, neurological disorders, and other complex conditions, paving the way for safer and more adaptable therapeutic approaches.

> RNA editing offers a promising alternative to DNA editing, addressing limitations like permanence and off-target effects. Unlike DNA editing, RNA editing modifies RNA molecules post-transcription, allowing for reversible, temporary changes that avoid permanent alterations to the genome. This enhances safety and reduces risks, as edits can degrade naturally if treatment is stopped. RNA editing's precision allows for single nucleotide changes without double-strand breaks, minimizing unintended mutations. While challenges like efficient delivery systems and editing accuracy remain, RNA editing shows potential for treating complex diseases, especially neurological disorders and genetic conditions, making it a safer, adaptive approach to genetic therapy.

# Why did SC uphold U.P. madrasa Act?

The Supreme Court on November 5, 2024, upheld the constitutional validity of the Uttar Pradesh Board of Madarsa Education Act, 2004, with exceptions. The top court set aside the Allahabad High Court’s decision, which had deemed the 2004 Act to be in breach of the principles of secularism. However, in its ruling, a three-judge Bench headed by Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud, contended that provisions allowing the madrasa board to award higher degrees such as Kamil (undergraduate studies) and Fazil (postgraduate studies) contravened the University Grants Commission (UGC) Act, 1956. rendering it unconstitutional.

How do madrasas operate?

The Arabic word “madrasah” denotes an educational institution. The madrasa system has been in existence since the era of the Delhi Sultanate, receiving patronage from the Khilji and Tughlaq dynasties. Over time, it evolved into a distinct education system providing religious and secular learning. Notable figures such as Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Rajendra Prasad, and Premchand are believed to have gained their foundational knowledge from madrasas and their teachers, known as maulvis.

The bulk of the funding for madrasas comes from the respective State governments. In 1993, the P.V. Narasimha Rao government recognised the necessity of integrating modern education into madrasas, resulting in the 2009 Scheme for Providing Quality Education in Madrasas (SPQEM).

According to data presented by the Union government in Parliament on February 3, 2020, India has 24,010 madrasas, with around 60% — approximately 14,400 — located in Uttar Pradesh. These include 11,621 recognised and 2,907 unrecognised madrasas. The 2004 Act was enacted to regulate these madrasas with respect to curriculum, standard of education, conduct of examinations, and qualifications for teaching. It also established the Uttar PradeshBoard of Madarsa Education, predominantly comprising members from the Muslim community. Under Section 9 of the Act, the Board is responsible for preparing course material, granting degrees, and conducting examinations.

What was the case?

A single judge of the Allahabad High Court on October 23, 2019, while hearing a petition filed by Mohammed Javed, expressed doubt regarding the validity of the 2004 Act.

Mr. Javed was appointed as a part-time assistant teacher in 2011 for the primary section of Madarsa Nisarul Uloom Shahzadpur, Akbarpur Post Office, District Ambedkar Nagar on a fixed salary of ₹4,000 per month, subject to an 8% annual increment. He approached the High Court, arguing that he should receive a salary equivalent to that of regular teachers.

He also contended that appointments to madrasas should be regulated by the State government, the Madarsa Shiksha Parishad, and the district minority welfare officer.

While referring the matter to a larger Bench, the judge observed, “With a secular Constitution in India, can persons of a particular religion be appointed or nominated in a board for education purposes or should it be persons belonging to any religion, who are exponent in the fields for the purposes of which the board is constituted...?”.

Meanwhile, lawyer Anshuman Singh Rathore filed a public interest Litigation (PIL) petition in the High Court challenging the validity of the 2004 Act on the ground that it violated secularism as well as Articles 14 (equality before law), 15 (which forbids discrimination) and 21A (right to education) of the Constitution. The larger Bench accordingly framed the question of law for adjudication as — “Whether the provisions of the Madarsa Act stand the test of secularism, which forms a part of the basic structure of the Constitution of India?” The impugned verdict was jointly pronounced on all such pleas.

Why did the High Court strike down the law?

After examining the curriculum taught in the madrasas, a Bench comprising Justices Subhash Vidyarthi and Vivek Chaudharyobserved that the education imparted in these institutions is “neither quality nor universal in nature” and that “the State has no power to create a Board for religious education or to establish a Board for school education only for a particular religion and philosophy associated with it.”

It thus concluded that the 2004 Act violated secularism and that the government could not “discriminate” by imparting education based on religious affiliation.

The judges further noted that while “Islamic studies” is mandatory in all madrasas, essential modern subjects such as English, Mathematics, Science, and Social Sciences are either excluded or made optional. This, they reasoned, undermines the State’s constitutional obligation under Article 21A to ensure “quality” education for all children aged six to fourteen.

Highlighting that “higher education” is a field reserved under Entry 66 of the Union List of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, the High Court further asserted that the State government lacks the competence to legislate on such matters. It accordingly ordered that students enrolled in madrasas be promptly accommodated in regular schools recognised by the State government.

What was NCPCR’s response?

The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR), the top child rights protection body in the country, told the top court that madrasas are “unsuitable or unfit” places for children to receive “proper education”. It also flagged concerns related to the curriculum, teachers’ eligibility, opaque funding, and violation of land laws to assert that such institutions fail to provide a “holistic environment” to children.

In June, the child rights body issued a series of directives urging the Chief Secretaries of all States and Union Territories to withdraw recognition of government-aided madrasas that do not comply with the Right to Education Act, 2005. Subsequently, the Chief Secretary of Uttar Pradesh directed District Collectors to examine madrasas that had enrolled non-Muslim students and ensure their immediate transfer to recognised schools. On August 28, the Tripura government issued a similar directive.

The Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind, an organisation of Muslim clerics, consequently challenged these directives in the Supreme Court contending that such measures encroached upon the rights of religious minorities to establish and manage their educational institutions under Article 30 of the Constitution. Accordingly, the court directed the concerned authorities to refrain from implementing these directives until the matter was conclusively adjudicated.

What did the Supreme Court finally decide?

Dismissing the High Court’s finding that the 2004 Act violated secularism, the Chief Justice underscored that any such purported infraction should be traced to an express provision of the Constitution and cannot simply be invalidated by making a blanket statement that it contravened the Basic Structure. “The reason is that concepts such as democracy, federalism, and secularism are undefined concepts. Allowing courts to strike down legislation for the violation of such concepts will introduce an element of uncertainty in our constitutional adjudication,” he reasoned.

The court further opined that the State must strike a delicate balance between maintaining quality education and respecting the autonomy of minority education institutions. It underscored that the 2004 Act ought to be construed to be in consonance with Article 21A “to ensure that religious minority institutions impart secular education of a requisite standard without destroying the minority character”. However, the Chief Justice cautioned that in accordance with Article 28(3) of the Constitution, a student attending a minority institution recognised by the State or receiving aid out of public funds should not be compelled to take part in religious instruction or forced to attend religious worship.

The unanimous verdict further noted that while madrasas offer religious instruction, their primary objective is to impart education, thereby bringing them within the fold of Entry 25 of the Concurrent List.

“The mere fact that the education sought to be regulated includes some religious teaching or instruction does not push a legislation outside the legislative competence of a State,” the judges asserted.

However, the court invalidated provisions of the 2024 Act that allowed the issuance of higher educational degrees, emphasising that such degrees are exclusively regulated by the UGC Act and thus lie beyond the legislative competence of the State legislature. Nonetheless, it clarified that this does not necessitate the annulment of the entire statute, as doing so would be akin to “throwing the baby out with the bathwater.”

What are the implications?

The verdict sets an important precedent for balancing essential state oversight with the protection of minority rights. By affirming the 2024 Act’s primary aim of imparting quality education, the court reinforces a nuanced approach to secularism that embraces diversity within India’s education system. Iftikhar Ahmed Javed, Chairman of the Uttar Pradesh Board of Madrasa Education, earlier told Reuters that dismantling madrasas would adversely impact 2.7 million students and 10,000 teachers in Uttar Pradesh alone. Additionally, the ruling may prompt the Centre to reconsider its substantial budget cuts for madrasa funding, which dropped from ₹10 crore in 2023-24 to ₹2 crore in 2024-25.

> The Supreme Court upheld the Uttar Pradesh Madrasa Act, which mandates regulation of madrasa education, ensuring alignment with broader educational standards and oversight. The Act was challenged on grounds that it infringed on the rights of minority institutions to operate autonomously. However, the SC ruled that the Act's provisions are in line with constitutional principles, aiming to improve educational quality without infringing on religious freedom. The court emphasized that regulatory measures are necessary for maintaining educational standards and public interest. This decision reinforced the state's authority to regulate educational institutions while respecting minority rights under the Constitution.
