# Food prices spur inflation to 6.2%

### Understanding Inflation and Its Surge to 6.2% Due to Food Prices

**What is Inflation?**

Inflation is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services rises, eroding the purchasing power of a currency. Essentially, when inflation occurs, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services, reducing consumers' purchasing power over time. Inflation is measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which tracks the prices of a basket of commonly purchased goods and services. When the CPI rises, it indicates that inflation is occurring. Moderate inflation is typically considered healthy for economic growth, as it encourages spending and investment; however, high or erratic inflation can have detrimental effects on the economy.

**Why Food Prices Spur Inflation to 6.2%**

The recent increase in inflation to 6.2% has been driven significantly by a surge in food prices. Several factors contribute to the rise in food prices, leading to an overall inflationary trend:

1. **Supply Chain Disruptions**: Global or local disruptions in the food supply chain can cause scarcity of food items. These disruptions might be due to natural disasters, geopolitical conflicts, or logistical problems, such as transportation issues and shortages of labor.

2. **Climatic Conditions**: Adverse weather events, including droughts, floods, or unexpected temperature changes, can severely impact agricultural output. Crop failures or reduced yields result in shortages of basic food items, pushing prices higher.

3. **Increased Cost of Production**: Rising costs of production inputs, such as fertilizers, seeds, fuel, and equipment, contribute to higher food prices. For instance, if the global price of crude oil rises, it increases the cost of transporting food, which is passed on to the consumer.

4. **Global Economic Factors**: Inflation can be influenced by global economic trends. If major exporting countries experience economic difficulties, the price of exported food items can rise, affecting global markets.

5. **High Demand and Low Supply**: An imbalance between the demand for and supply of food products can drive prices up. Population growth and changing consumption patterns can also put pressure on food production, leading to inflationary tendencies.

**Consequences of High Inflation**

Inflation at 6.2% is considered high and has several economic impacts:

- **Reduced Purchasing Power**: Households feel the impact of inflation as their money loses value, reducing the amount of goods and services they can afford.
- **Increased Cost of Living**: Higher food prices mean that a larger portion of household income is spent on basic needs, leaving less for other discretionary spending.
- **Economic Uncertainty**: Persistent inflation creates uncertainty, making businesses cautious about investments and hiring, which can slow economic growth.
- **Interest Rate Adjustments**: Central banks may raise interest rates to combat high inflation, which can make borrowing more expensive for both consumers and businesses, potentially leading to a slowdown in economic activity.

**Measures to Overcome Inflation**

To mitigate inflationary pressures, governments and central banks can take various actions:

1. **Monetary Policy Adjustments**: Central banks can raise interest rates to curb spending and borrowing. By making loans and credit more expensive, consumer demand decreases, which can help lower inflation. This is often a double-edged sword, as it can also slow economic growth.

2. **Fiscal Policies**: Governments can reduce public spending or increase taxes to limit the money supply in the economy. While this may not directly impact food prices, it helps control general inflationary pressures.

3. **Supply Chain Improvements**: Investing in better logistics and infrastructure can reduce transportation costs and improve the flow of goods, potentially easing price pressures.

4. **Strategic Reserves**: Maintaining strategic reserves of essential food items can be an effective way to manage supply shortages and prevent price spikes during difficult periods.

5. **Support to Agriculture**: Providing subsidies, investing in agricultural technology, and supporting local farmers can help increase food production and mitigate price volatility due to supply shortages.

6. **Price Controls and Subsidies**: Temporary price controls or subsidies for essential items can help keep food prices in check, although this is generally used as a short-term solution.

**Conclusion**

The surge in inflation to 6.2%, driven by rising food prices, poses significant challenges to both policymakers and consumers. Understanding the root causes, including supply chain issues, climatic conditions, and economic factors, is crucial for developing effective measures to manage inflation. Solutions require a balanced approach involving both short-term measures, such as targeted subsidies, and long-term policies like improving agricultural productivity and supply chain logistics. By employing these strategies, the economy can navigate periods of high inflation and stabilize over time.

> Inflation, the rise in general price levels, has surged to 6.2%, driven largely by increasing food prices due to supply chain disruptions, adverse weather, higher production costs, and global economic factors. High inflation reduces purchasing power, raises the cost of living, and creates economic uncertainty. To address this, central banks can raise interest rates to control spending, while governments can adjust fiscal policies, enhance supply chains, and support agricultural production. Temporary measures like subsidies or price controls can also help. A balanced approach involving both short- and long-term strategies is essential for stabilizing the economy and mitigating inflation's impact.

### The India-Canada Diplomatic Row: Impact and Future Outlook

The recent diplomatic conflict between India and Canada has significant implications for the people who share ties with both nations. This tension began when Canadian authorities made public their belief that Indian officials were involved in the 2023 killing of Khalistan activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. This accusation strained relations, especially with Washington's concurrent allegations regarding a plot against Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, complicating the matter further.

A notable incident on November 3 epitomized the escalating tension: a consular camp organized by the Indian mission at the Hindu Sabha Mandir in Brampton was disrupted by Khalistan activists, leading to violence. This event was soon followed by protests by a Hindu group that also turned violent. The violent disruption of a routine consular camp reflects poorly on Canada's status as a stable democracy that upholds the rule of law. Prime Minister Narendra Modi described the violence and intimidation of Indian diplomats as “deliberate” and “cowardly,” while Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the incident “unacceptable,” highlighting mutual concerns about the state of diplomatic security.

The stakes are high, as nearly 19 lakh individuals, or around 4% of Canada’s population, are of Indian origin. These individuals have strong connections to India and require regular consular services. Ensuring their safety and the continuity of these services is crucial for both nations. That a small, violent faction can disrupt essential diplomatic functions underscores the need for stronger law enforcement and protective measures by the Canadian government to maintain stability and ensure the security of diplomats and consular activities.

The larger diplomatic fallout has affected more than just interpersonal and consular relations. The bilateral trade between India and Canada is valued at approximately $19 billion, encompassing goods and services. This trade was expected to flourish with the anticipated bilateral trade agreement, but current negotiations have been stalled due to the diplomatic strain. Although both nations have taken steps to shield their economic relations from political conflict, disruptions, particularly in visa issuance on both sides, could have long-term effects. These disruptions impact not only business relations but also academic, cultural, and familial exchanges that are integral to the close-knit connections between the two countries.

The diplomatic crisis also takes place against the backdrop of diaspora politics. Canada’s sizeable Indian diaspora is diverse and includes individuals with differing political and religious views. The turmoil originates in part from the fractious nature of these diaspora communities, where radical elements have historically agitated for specific political causes, including support for Khalistan, a separatist movement that India vehemently opposes.

Beyond India-Canada relations, Canada is facing domestic challenges in border management and immigration policy. Reports indicate that nearly two-thirds of Canadians believe that the current immigration rate is too high. This has led to tightening border controls and new restrictions on student visas, directly impacting Indian students, who form a significant portion of Canada’s international student community. The new visa policies could deter Indian aspirants and further strain ties between the two nations, as students are an essential bridge in bilateral relations and contribute to Canada’s economy and educational institutions.

Despite the current tension, both countries share common interests that could facilitate dialogue and future cooperation. Climate change, for instance, is an issue on which India and Canada have significant alignment. Collaborative efforts in addressing global challenges could serve as a neutral ground for rebuilding trust and fostering a cooperative spirit.

Moving forward, it is essential that both nations prioritize de-escalating tensions and maintaining open channels for diplomatic engagement. Avoiding disruptions to consular services is particularly important to ensure the well-being of the diaspora and maintain the flow of people-to-people connections, which have historically been beneficial for both sides. Canada must reinforce its commitment to the security of all diplomats within its borders, reflecting the rule of law and its status as a democracy.

The road to full normalization of ties may be long, but strategic steps can pave the way. Both nations must curb activities that deepen communal divides and work towards mutual respect and understanding. By focusing on shared values and economic interests, India and Canada have the potential to overcome their differences and reestablish strong bilateral relations for the future.

> The India-Canada diplomatic row, stemming from Canada's claims of Indian involvement in the 2023 killing of Khalistan activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, has strained relations and impacted the diaspora. Violent incidents, such as the disruption of an Indian consular camp, have raised concerns about the safety of Indian diplomats in Canada. Bilateral trade talks have stalled, and new Canadian visa restrictions may affect Indian students. Despite tensions, the two nations share interests in issues like climate change. Prioritizing consular services, ensuring diplomatic security, and fostering collaboration can help rebuild trust and maintain strong ties for mutual benefit.

# A mixed report card for the IMEC

In September 2023, the ambitious transcontinental **India-Middle East-Europe Corridor (IMEC)** was announced on the sidelines of the G20 summit in New Delhi. The proposed corridor is expected to reduce the transit time between its eastern and western nodes by 40%, and costs by 30%, compared to transportation via the **Suez Canal**. These numbers may vary as the actual benefits may end up being on the lower side, but there is no denying that the new corridor, once operational, will be a game changer for the international maritime trade. Therefore, it is important to understand how the idea has shaped since its announcement and what lies ahead of it.

### Progress on both ends

Over the past year, various challenges have delayed progress on the project. The announcement of the corridor came with much optimism. However, this did not last long, as the very premise which led to the conception of this idea, namely, the normalisation of Arab-Israel relations, came to a sudden halt with the escalation of the conflict between Israel and Palestine on October 7 last year. This crisis engulfed the whole of West Asia for the larger part of the year, which put the corridor on the back-burner. As a result of the temporary pause, two key stakeholders, Saudi Arabia and Jordan, have not been able to make any progress on the project. Though it may be argued that the official relations between Arab countries and Israel won’t impact completion of work on the ground, the two governments, which will have to work closely with the Israeli establishment for the project, would not want the optics and its geopolitical dimension. Therefore, implementation on the northern part of the corridor, which is mostly in West Asia, is going to move slowly until the ongoing escalation subsides.

On the eastern leg of the corridor connecting the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Indian ports, things are moving forward at a relatively fast pace. The economic relations of the two countries are on a northward trajectory, which is also reflected in the increasing bilateral trade numbers. Post the signing of the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) in 2022, bilateral trade has grown from $43.30 billion in 2020-21 to $83.64 billion in 2023-24 (a staggering 93%). Another important feature of the growing bilateral trade is the diversification of the trade basket between the two countries, which is reflected in the growing non-oil trade. The non-oil trade between India and the UAE grew from $28.67 billion in 2020-21 to $57.81 billion in 2023-24. This represents a healthy shift from an Indian perspective, considering that most of these commodities will be transported further west and north through the IMEC, thereby improving India’s export share in the larger region.

Beyond amplifying trade volumes, the two countries are also working on the standardisation and facilitation of trade processes. Recently, India and the UAE launched the Virtual Trade Corridor. This will be an integral part of the IMEC, aimed at the reduction of administrative processes and time, reduction of logistics and transportation costs, and ease of doing trade. The streamlining of trade processes would not only serve bilateral relations, but also pave the way and provide a working model for other countries involved in the IMEC to develop similar frameworks for cross-border trade facilitation.

After more than a year since the IMEC was announced, we see an uncertain western part of the corridor trying to navigate through the conflict and a committed eastern part that is forging new linkages to ready itself for the new maritime order.

Further, given the one-year progress and the situation on the ground, it is clear that only the connectivity aspect of the IMEC initiative is gaining some traction at the moment. Other elements of the corridor, including clean energy export, undersea fiber-optic cables and pipelines, energy grid linkages, telecommunication lines, and clean energy technology cooperation, will have to wait till the situation in West Asia normalises. Therefore, the countries on the eastern part of the corridor should use this time to develop their capacity to improve connectivity among them.

### What India can do

India, especially, can use this time to prepare its ports, develop specific economic zones along the connectivity nodes, and improve its domestic logistics for seamless integration with the IMEC. There is a need to improve the digital footprint in the domestic logistics landscape, which will help reduce logistics time and costs, thereby making Indian exports more competitive. Further, the corridor, as ambitious as it may be, is just the means. The actual benefits will be seen only if India can improve its integration in the global value chains. With IMEC, India aims to position itself as a global supply chain alternative. This can only happen if the country takes steps towards enhancing its manufacturing competitiveness.

Finally, it is time to push for the IMEC secretariat, which can make the structure and working of the IMEC more organised. For starters, the secretariat can work on developing the framework for streamlining the cross-border trade processes and empirical evidence-based research on benefits accruing to participating countries. This would help countries in the neighbourhood of the corridor to better understand the project. This may end up generating interest, which could result in them joining it.

The **India-Middle East Corridor** refers to a strategic initiative aimed at enhancing connectivity between India and the Middle East through a network of infrastructure, trade routes, and cooperative agreements. This corridor seeks to strengthen economic ties and promote smoother transportation of goods, energy, and services between India and the Gulf region, fostering regional development and cooperation.

### Key Objectives of the Corridor:
1. **Trade Facilitation**: Boosting trade volumes by providing more efficient, reliable, and cost-effective transport routes.
2. **Energy Security**: Strengthening partnerships with Middle Eastern countries, which are key energy suppliers for India, ensuring a steady flow of oil and gas.
3. **Investment Opportunities**: Creating new avenues for bilateral and multilateral investments in infrastructure projects such as ports, railways, and logistics networks.
4. **Regional Stability**: Enhancing cooperation to promote political stability, economic growth, and mutual development in the region.

### Components of the Corridor:
- **Maritime Routes**: The corridor emphasizes building robust sea routes that connect major Indian ports with those in the Middle East, enhancing maritime trade capacity.
- **Rail and Road Infrastructure**: Proposals include developing rail and road links within the Middle Eastern countries to ensure goods transported by sea can move efficiently to other regions, including Europe.
- **Digital Connectivity**: Strengthening digital infrastructure to facilitate smoother and faster communication between the regions.
- **Energy Pipelines**: Possible development of energy pipelines for more efficient fuel transport.

### Strategic Importance:
- **Economic Growth**: It positions India to leverage the Middle East’s market and resources to boost its own economic growth.
- **Geopolitical Significance**: The corridor reduces dependency on traditional routes like the Suez Canal and establishes India as a significant player in West Asian geopolitics.
- **Diversified Partnerships**: It helps India build diverse partnerships with Middle Eastern nations beyond energy, including technology, trade, and human resource development.

### Challenges:
- **Geopolitical Tensions**: The corridor must navigate regional conflicts and rivalries in the Middle East that can disrupt projects.
- **Infrastructure Investment**: Requires significant investment in infrastructure development, which may pose financial and logistical challenges.
- **Logistics and Coordination**: Managing smooth coordination between multiple nations with varying regulations and standards.

### Potential Benefits:
- **Enhanced Trade Routes**: Reduces transportation time and cost, making trade more efficient.
- **Strengthened Bilateral Relations**: Promotes greater collaboration between India and Middle Eastern countries.
- **Economic Integration**: Contributes to the economic integration of participating nations, boosting regional prosperity.

The **India-Middle East Corridor** is a strategic plan that can unlock significant potential in terms of trade, economic growth, and regional partnerships, but its success hinges on cooperation, sustained investments, and the resolution of regional conflicts.

> The **India-Middle East Corridor** is a strategic initiative aimed at boosting connectivity and trade between India and the Middle East. It focuses on developing infrastructure such as maritime routes, rail and road networks, energy pipelines, and digital connectivity to facilitate efficient transport and communication. The corridor aims to enhance trade, ensure energy security, and create investment opportunities, promoting regional stability and economic integration. While it offers significant benefits like reduced transportation costs and stronger bilateral ties, challenges include geopolitical tensions, substantial infrastructure investments, and coordination across nations.

# Reining in civil servants in Kerala

The recent controversies in Kerala involving civil servants K. Gopalakrishnan and N. Prasanth raise critical issues related to civil service ethics, conduct, and the principles that guide public administration. Civil servants play a vital role in upholding the integrity, neutrality, and professionalism of governance, making adherence to ethical standards paramount. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the ethical dimensions relevant to these cases for a UPSC perspective:

### 1. **Impartiality and Political Neutrality**
   - **Case Context**: K. Gopalakrishnan allegedly forming a WhatsApp group titled ‘Mallu Hindu Officers’ raises questions about impartiality and political neutrality. Civil servants must ensure that their actions do not indicate bias towards any community, religion, or political ideology.
   - **Ethical Principle**: Impartiality is essential to maintain trust in the public administration system. A civil servant must serve all citizens fairly and without discrimination, ensuring decisions are objective and unbiased.

### 2. **Integrity and Accountability**
   - **Case Context**: N. Prasanth’s allegations against Additional Chief Secretary A. Jayathilak on social media not only question the conduct of civil servants but also impact public perception of the administrative machinery. Allegations made publicly without substantiation can undermine institutional credibility.
   - **Ethical Principle**: Integrity involves upholding honesty and moral principles in service. Public servants must avoid behaviors that compromise their roles or create perceptions of conflict. Accountability ensures that they are answerable for their actions, which must always align with service rules and the public interest.

### 3. **Conduct and Professionalism**
   - **Case Context**: Both officials were suspended due to charges of misconduct and impropriety. Such conduct reflects poorly on the professional standards expected of civil servants, whose behavior should be exemplary to maintain public trust.
   - **Ethical Principle**: Professionalism requires maintaining decorum, respecting hierarchy, and adhering to official protocols. Civil servants must avoid engaging in any activity that could tarnish the reputation of the public office or disrupt the functioning of the administration.

### 4. **Service Rules and Ethical Guidelines**
   - **Case Context**: The suspension by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, following an inquiry report, underscores the importance of adhering to established service rules. Civil service conduct rules often outline permissible and non-permissible behaviors, including maintaining confidentiality, using appropriate communication channels, and refraining from actions that could incite communal tensions.
   - **Ethical Principle**: Civil servants are bound by a code of conduct that promotes impartial service delivery, responsible use of communication tools, and internal conflict resolution without involving public platforms.

### 5. **Confidentiality and Responsible Communication**
   - **Case Context**: Allegations made on social media violate norms regarding the use of public communication channels for addressing grievances. Issues involving senior colleagues and internal administration should be resolved within the framework of official mechanisms rather than through public forums.
   - **Ethical Principle**: Civil servants must use responsible communication, upholding confidentiality and refraining from actions that could damage the public image of government institutions. Proper channels for expressing grievances or reporting misconduct should always be used to prevent damaging public trust.

### **Conclusion**
The suspension of K. Gopalakrishnan and N. Prasanth serves as a reminder of the critical importance of maintaining ethical standards in public administration. Upholding principles such as impartiality, integrity, professionalism, accountability, and confidentiality ensures that civil servants act as pillars of an unbiased and effective governance system. This incident highlights that deviations from these principles can lead to disciplinary action and diminish public confidence in administrative systems. For future civil servants, it is essential to internalize these values and uphold them in service to maintain the credibility and functionality of the public administration.

> The recent suspension of Kerala civil servants K. Gopalakrishnan and N. Prasanth underscores key ethical issues in public administration. Gopalakrishnan’s creation of a WhatsApp group allegedly for Hindu officers raises concerns about impartiality, while Prasanth’s public social media allegations against a senior colleague breach professional conduct. These incidents highlight the importance of civil service ethics, including impartiality, integrity, professionalism, and responsible communication. Adherence to service rules ensures trust in public institutions and proper conflict resolution.

# In Baku breakthrough, COP clears carbon credit trade

### COP29 and the Global Carbon Market Agreement

At the annual COP29 climate conference held in Baku, a significant milestone was achieved when participating countries reached an agreement to finalize a global carbon market, long delayed by various challenges. This market is a pivotal mechanism in the international fight against climate change, facilitating the trade of carbon credits — certified reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Such credits allow countries to meet emission reduction targets more flexibly and cost-effectively. The value of these credits is influenced by emission caps established by countries, essentially creating an economic incentive to reduce emissions.

### Origin and Mechanism of the Global Carbon Market

The concept of a global carbon market stems from **Article 6** of the **Paris Agreement**, adopted in 2015. Article 6 is designed to support international cooperation in reducing emissions through carbon trading. It has two main components:

1. **Article 6.2**: This sub-section provides a framework for countries to engage in **bilateral or multilateral trading** of carbon credits. This means countries can directly exchange carbon reductions, enabling collaboration and economic benefits in reducing emissions.
2. **Article 6.4**: This sub-section lays the groundwork for a **UN-supervised global carbon market**, which allows for a standardized and transparent process for countries and private entities to generate, trade, and purchase carbon credits.

Both components seek to encourage nations to surpass their domestic efforts to reduce emissions and to support sustainable development through international cooperation.

### Challenges in Implementing a Global Carbon Market

Despite the promise of carbon trading to enhance global emission reduction efforts, the operationalization of this market has faced numerous hurdles:

- **Credibility and Authenticity of Carbon Credits**: A major concern has been ensuring that the carbon credits represent genuine reductions in emissions. The effectiveness of the carbon market depends on rigorous oversight to prevent fraudulent or dubious credits that do not lead to real emission reductions. For example, “double-counting” of credits, where two countries claim the same reduction, has been a contentious issue.
- **Transparency and Verification**: Establishing transparent processes for tracking and verifying carbon credit generation is critical to maintaining trust in the system. Mechanisms must ensure that projects claiming to reduce emissions adhere to strict international standards and that credits are traceable.
- **Equitable Participation**: Ensuring that low- and middle-income countries can participate meaningfully in the market is vital. These nations often require technical and financial support to develop carbon-reducing projects and enter the market effectively.

### Achievements at COP29

The agreement reached at COP29 marks a turning point in addressing these challenges. By agreeing to finalise and implement the rules governing the global carbon market, countries have set the stage for increased cooperation in meeting climate targets. The key provisions agreed upon include:

- **Strengthened Verification Mechanisms**: The agreement mandates stricter verification processes for projects that generate carbon credits. This ensures that the credits traded are based on actual and verifiable emission reductions.
- **Transparency in Credit Origins**: Enhanced requirements for documentation and reporting were agreed upon to guarantee that the origins and details of each carbon credit are accessible, preventing issues such as double-counting.
- **Governance by the UN Body**: The finalised framework will be supervised by a United Nations-appointed body to standardize practices, improve oversight, and promote trust in the market.

### Implications of the Global Carbon Market

The operationalization of a global carbon market has several far-reaching implications:

- **Economic Benefits**: Countries with excess capacity to reduce emissions can generate revenue by selling carbon credits, while others that face higher costs for emission reduction can purchase these credits to meet their goals more affordably.
- **Climate Action Acceleration**: The economic incentives created by the carbon market encourage investment in low-carbon technologies and sustainable development projects.
- **Equity Concerns**: The framework aims to balance the benefits between developed and developing countries. Support mechanisms are being developed to help less affluent countries participate, ensuring that global climate action remains inclusive.

### Conclusion

The decision at COP29 to finalise the global carbon market agreement is a significant step forward in collective climate action. By addressing issues related to transparency, verification, and equitable participation, the new framework provides a structured path for countries to trade carbon credits responsibly and effectively. This mechanism not only facilitates achieving national climate targets but also reinforces global cooperation under the Paris Agreement. The success of this system will hinge on diligent implementation, ongoing oversight, and adaptive measures to respond to future challenges, ultimately propelling the world closer to achieving net-zero emissions.

> At COP29 in Baku, countries finalized a long-awaited global carbon market agreement, allowing for the trade of carbon credits as outlined in Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. This market enables countries to trade certified emission reductions to meet climate targets cost-effectively. Key provisions include strict verification mechanisms to ensure genuine emission reductions, enhanced transparency for tracking credits, and UN oversight for standardized practices. Challenges like double-counting and equitable participation have been addressed, promoting trust and inclusion. This initiative aims to accelerate climate action, foster investment in sustainable projects, and support cooperation between developed and developing countries.

# Significance of Adi Sankara

**Adi Shankaracharya** (Adi Sankara), an 8th-century Indian philosopher and theologian, is regarded as one of the most influential figures in the history of Hinduism. His work laid the foundation for **Advaita Vedanta**, a non-dualistic school of Hindu philosophy. He played a pivotal role in revitalizing and unifying the diverse and fragmented religious landscape of India during his time. Here’s a detailed explanation of his significance:

### 1. **Philosophical Contributions**
- **Advaita Vedanta**: Adi Shankara’s greatest contribution was formalizing and popularizing Advaita Vedanta, which posits that **Brahman** (the ultimate reality) is the only truth, and the universe is an illusion (Maya). The individual self (Atman) is not different from Brahman, implying the oneness of all existence.
- **Non-Dualism (Advaita)**: He argued that true knowledge (Jnana) is the realization of the unity between Atman and Brahman, dissolving the distinctions between the individual soul and the universal reality.
- **Foundational Texts**: Shankara wrote extensive commentaries on major Hindu scriptures such as the **Upanishads**, **Brahmasutras**, and the **Bhagavad Gita**. His interpretations provided a philosophical basis for understanding the complex Vedic texts in a coherent manner that highlighted the non-dualistic vision.

### 2. **Restoration of Vedic Dharma**
- **Reform and Unification**: During Shankara’s time, India’s spiritual landscape was fragmented, with various ritualistic practices and superstitions diluting the essence of Vedic teachings. Shankara’s work re-established the primacy of the **Vedas** and the **Upanishads**, advocating a return to their philosophical core.
- **Countering Other Schools**: He engaged in debates with proponents of other schools of thought, such as **Mimamsa**, **Buddhism**, and **Jainism**, solidifying Advaita Vedanta as a mainstream philosophy. These debates were crucial in reducing the influence of Buddhism in India at that time, leading to a resurgence of Vedic practices.
- **Monastic Orders**: Shankara established the **Dashanami Sampradaya** (ten monastic orders) and **four Mathas (monasteries)** at **Sringeri, Dwaraka, Puri, and Joshimath** to preserve and propagate Advaita Vedanta. These centers became hubs of spiritual learning and have continued to play a key role in Hindu religious life.

### 3. **Literary Contributions**
- **Bhashyas (Commentaries)**: Shankara’s commentaries on the **Brahmasutras, Bhagavad Gita**, and **Upanishads** are authoritative texts for understanding Advaita Vedanta. His interpretations clarified the non-dual nature of reality, providing a philosophical foundation that influenced many later scholars and spiritual leaders.
- **Prakarana Granthas (Introductory Texts)**: Shankara also composed independent philosophical treatises like **“Vivekachudamani” (The Crest-Jewel of Discrimination)** and **“Atma Bodha” (Knowledge of the Self)**, which serve as accessible introductions to his philosophy.
- **Stotras (Hymns)**: Shankara composed devotional hymns like **“Bhaja Govindam”** and **“Dakshinamurthy Stotram”**, blending deep philosophical insights with accessible devotional expression, making complex ideas more relatable to laypeople.

### 4. **Spiritual and Cultural Impact**
- **Synthesis of Bhakti and Jnana**: While emphasizing knowledge (Jnana), Shankara did not neglect the importance of devotion (Bhakti). His hymns and teachings often incorporated a blend of devotion and philosophical reflection, promoting a holistic approach to spirituality.
- **Promotion of Tolerance**: Shankara’s works promoted an inclusive approach, advocating that all paths ultimately lead to the same truth. His philosophy reinforced that apparent differences in rituals and worship are expressions of the same underlying reality.
- **Legacy and Influence**: Shankara’s Advaita Vedanta has profoundly influenced subsequent Indian philosophers and leaders like **Swami Vivekananda**, **Ramana Maharshi**, and **Ramakrishna Paramahamsa**. His ideas also reached beyond India, impacting modern interpretations of Hinduism in the West.

### 5. **Establishment of the Four Mathas**
- **Institutional Framework**: To ensure the longevity and dissemination of Advaita Vedanta, Shankara established four **Mathas** (monastic centers) in different corners of India:
  - **Sringeri Sharada Peetham** in the south (Karnataka)
  - **Dwaraka Pitha** in the west (Gujarat)
  - **Govardhan Pitha** in the east (Puri, Odisha)
  - **Jyotir Math** in the north (Uttarakhand)
- **Role of Mathas**: These institutions preserved Vedic knowledge, facilitated training for monks, and promoted religious and cultural practices. They continue to function as beacons of spiritual learning and guardians of Vedic traditions.

### 6. **Revival of Pilgrimage Tradition**
- **Char Dham Yatra**: Shankara emphasized the importance of pilgrimage as a means of spiritual growth. He conceptualized the **Char Dham Yatra** (the journey to the four sacred shrines), reinforcing the interconnectedness of the diverse spiritual practices within Hinduism.

### **Conclusion**
Adi Shankaracharya’s significance lies in his profound philosophical insights, literary contributions, and efforts to reform and unify Hinduism. By establishing the principles of Advaita Vedanta, reviving Vedic traditions, and creating a structured approach to spirituality through monastic orders and Mathas, he laid the groundwork for a resilient and cohesive Hindu philosophy. His legacy continues to inspire spiritual seekers, fostering a deeper understanding of the non-dual nature of existence and influencing Hindu thought and practice for generations.

> Adi Shankaracharya, an 8th-century philosopher, profoundly shaped Hinduism through his promotion of **Advaita Vedanta**, emphasizing the non-dual nature of reality where **Brahman** is the only truth and the self (Atman) is identical to it. He revitalized Hinduism by countering other schools of thought, curbing the influence of Buddhism, and restoring Vedic teachings. Shankara’s influential works include commentaries on the **Upanishads**, **Brahmasutras**, and **Bhagavad Gita**, as well as devotional hymns. He established four major **Mathas** to spread Vedantic philosophy and unify diverse practices. His teachings continue to inspire and promote a blend of knowledge (Jnana) and devotion (Bhakti).

# The quest for freedom: is the ‘will’ truly free?

Since the dawn of history, the most central question of human existence has been whether or not we have free will. The question might seem pointless to many and airy philosophising to others. However, attempting to answer it is foundational to our moral codes, legal framework, interpersonal relationships, religious belief, and even to the very meaning of life itself.

What do we mean by free will? Simply defined, it is the power to make choices unconstrained by external agencies. However, this simple definition might be a bit misleading. For we are constantly constrained by external agencies; whether they be physical, psychological, or social. A body starved of a steady influx of nutrition and hydration can sustain itself only for so long; a mind saddled with trauma will be too stunned to cogitate efficiently; a society which is despotic will be too asphyxiated to generate new ideas. And yet, the definition is not incorrect. After all, if consciousness is determined by existence, then existence in turn is reshaped by consciousness. This kinesis between the world and the self is the concentric and eccentric contractions of free will.

How then can one be truly free? Is not the human race bound to this principle of cause and effect? And if it is, as all things are, why does it have the ability to make choices at all?

### Of human bondage

There are those who argue against free will altogether. Many scientists, philosophers, and theologians argue that the architecture of the brain, the nature of causality, or the power of God precludes free will. Fatalism, in the sense that all things, including human action, are fated, is as ancient as the notion that human beings can make choices to alter the course of events. The niyativāda of the Ājīvikas of ancient India, the Calvinist doctrine of predestination, the mechanistic weltanschauung of the deists’ clockwork universe, all conclude in characterising human beings either as automata or in a state of providential thraldom. “We are dogs tied to a cart. Somebody else is leading,” as Chrysippus had pronounced, reducing the human to the canine; man had finally been cast in the role of “man’s best friend”.

Yet, far from the truth, the fatalists find themselves within a trap of their own making. If free will is nothing but mere illusion, then they are acting in that illusion even as they argue against it. If one chooses without choice, as the argument holds, then in fact one never chooses at all. It must then be conceded that the freedom of individuals declaring unfreedom as the rule is a sort of bondage. If that is true then those seeking the truth must push past these interlocutors. Instead of the fatalism that follows in these arguments, one must seek to understand. It is evident that absolute free will is a fiction of human invention, and pursuing a fiction must be child’s play. Unfortunately, the rational faculties that ennoble a society have not yet embraced the notion of necessity.

Man does not come to earth armed with much except his mind. In order to feed themselves, early human beings had to hunt, or plant food. Both require a cognitive process — whether it be to understand the quality of the soil, to discern the climatic patterns, to understand the properties of seeds, to examine the behaviour of animals, et al. Our ancient ancestors’ ability to develop agriculture and hunt or domesticate animals relied exclusively on their capacity to continually increase their understanding of the workings of nature. It was trial and error, and yet it was a rationally determined process. The freedom to choose was the apogee of human nature; the human capacity of reason was its modus operandi.

It is precisely a recognition that we have degrees of freedom rather than absolute freedom that liberates the human mind.

The philosopher and political theorist Hannah Arendt aptly stated: “Man cannot be free if he does not know that he is subject to necessity, because his freedom is always won in his never wholly successful attempts to liberate himself from necessity.”

### Long walk to freedom

History is a record of the human struggle for freedom. The evolution of society is but a continuation of biological evolution. At the outset of existence, the individual human being struggled for existence in the face of an indifferent natural order; in order to make the struggle more effective, the individual began to co-operate with other individual human beings, giving rise to the collective unit of society. Thus, history is an organic evolutionary process.

The opposing view is to imagine man as a marionette, a puppet dancing on the strings of divine providence, or at the whims of social obduracy, incapable of self-willed action. As such, political systems, ideological tenets, or religious doctrine which undermine the rational human being at the expense of a mob’s group-think, produce at best a herd like society, incapable of producing self-propelling individuals who by conquering nature contribute to an ever increasing share of progress for society as a whole. At the end of the belief that an individual exists only to serve communal interests, conceived either by birth to a grouping based on ‘inborn’ qualities or through ‘divine’ fiat provided by prophetical writ, lies the cul de sac of dogmatism. This negates personal freedom, which is driven by the objective of personal happiness; society’s happiness being the ever-welcome consequence of what comes first — self-realisation of the individual.

In essence, society is a product of rational human endeavour; even if it sometimes does not act rationally. But then society itself is an incorporation of its individual members. Freedom cannot be a patrimony of a collective, even if it can have collective consequence. The idea of group freedom negates itself, for it implies that it is the group that exists in primacy and not the individual. Knowledge might be collectively owned but it must be processed by the individual. There is no such phenomenon as a collective brain any more than there is a collective digestive system. It might be possible to feed people together but the act of digestion must be individuated. While there may be collective education, the process of learning is implicitly individual. Similarly, social freedom is also an expression of individual freedom.

Marx and Engels attest to the aforesaid logic of individual freedom. As The Communist Manifesto, often cast as the gospel of collectivism, aptly declares: “The free development of each is the condition for the free development of all.”

### Will to freedom

“I have free will; I have no choice but to have it,” Christopher Hitchens had said when posed with the quandary of the origin of the freedom of will. The assertion that free will is a vestige of the human constitution is an ancient one; as is the affirmation that it is a holy patrimony, given to man by the grace of an almighty will. If, however, free will is deduced not from within the evolutionary process, it dissolves into transcendental morality, which is the belief that human beings can be moral only by the grace of divine law. In the process it destroys its very foundation. If human sovereignty is derived from a higher power, then it ceases to be truly sovereign. When life is believed to be a sequence of predetermined events beyond human control, then subordination to super-natural authority, and in concurrence, its agents or agencies on earth, is made to seem as the highest humanly attainable virtue. The corollary is denial of human creativeness.

Choice, however, is not a function of chance. Far from being an exception to the principle of causality, volition, and the subsequent action, is itself a type of causation. Man being an integral part of nature, his will to freedom is an instinctual urge — a manifestation of natural law. A monistic view of the cosmos precludes the apparent contradiction between nature’s law and human will. There is no contradiction between reason and will; on the other hand, rationalist metaphysics and cosmological physicalism can be harmonised in a monistic philosophical system. Human reason is a continuation of natural law, and is a product of the causal relationships implicit therein. In that lies a reconciliation of the concept of necessity and the impulse for freedom.

The rationalist sanction of morality frees man from the mystic connotation traditionally associated with moral concepts. To a free man, the notion of good and evil must be understood by reference to the rationality implicit within him. It is within the capacity of human reason and will to work out a heaven on earth. It is as Shelley states in Prometheus Unbound: “Ceaseless, and rapid, and fierce, and free, with the spirits which build a new earth and sea, and a heaven where yet heaven could never be.”

> The concept of free will questions whether human actions are truly autonomous or influenced by external factors. Philosophers debate if our choices are genuinely free or predetermined by genetics, environment, and subconscious processes. While many advocate that free will exists and individuals have the power to make independent decisions, determinists argue that every action is the result of preceding causes. Modern neuroscience adds complexity by suggesting that brain activity may predict decisions before conscious awareness. The quest for understanding free will remains unresolved, leaving open the debate on whether human autonomy is genuine or an illusion shaped by external forces.

# Debating the ‘healthy longevity initiative’

Once in a while, the **World Bank** publishes a visionary and profound report on an important aspect of human well being. A case in point is **‘Unlocking the Power of Healthy Longevity: Demographic Change, Non-communicable Diseases, and Human Capital’** that was published in Washington DC in September 2024. A significant demographic transformation is underway with a rapidly aging population. This transformation is accompanied by a shift in most Low-and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC) such that non-communicable diseases (NCD) are the leading cause of deaths. Most NCD deaths occur in LMICs, and the proportion of all deaths caused by NCDs is likely to surge among them.

Projections suggest a global surge in deaths from 61 million in 2023 to 92 million in 2050, as well as related increases in needs for NCD-related hospitalisation and long-term care. If LMICs can achieve ambitious yet feasible rates of progress, the world could avert 25 million deaths annually by 2050, effectively halving avoidable deaths and meeting the related Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).

Driven by this concern, the World Bank report proposes a healthy longevity initiative (HLI) which takes a life course approach. Briefly, healthy longevity entails sharply reducing avoidable death and serious disability throughout the life cycle, as well as increased levels of physical, mental, and social functioning through middle and older ages, and short period of time before inevitable death (World Bank, 2024). Whether this is feasible in LMICs, especially India, is debatable.

Curiously, it imagines a world in which health care is accessible, doctors and nurses, and para medical staff are competent, honest, and committed to proper patient care, hospitals are well-equipped, the monitoring of patients is systematic and digitised, and there is an awareness of benefits of early detection and treatment of NCDs. While the World Bank report discusses catastrophic health expenses and impoverishment, and inadequate state funding of health care, the chasm between the real world and that which is subsumed in the HLI is much too deep to be overlooked. Indeed, a world without quacks, corrupt doctors, exploitative hospitals, pharmaceutical companies pushing unsafe medicines, and patients with chronic conditions travelling hundreds of miles is rarefied.

The objectives and the strategy of reducing the surge in NCDs must, therefore, be modest and feasible. A recent study by the writers of this article of the growing burden of NCDs in India is a step in this direction.

### India’s elderly population, disease concerns

The older population of India is currently the world’s second largest — 140 million people who are aged 60 years and above (compared to 250 million people in China). Moreover, the average annual growth rate of the older population is almost three times higher than the overall population growth rate of India.

The swift descent of the elderly in India (60 years-plus) into NCDs (for example, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes) could have disastrous consequences in terms of an impoverishment of families, excess mortality, lowering of investment and a consequent deceleration of economic growth. Worse, the government has to deal simultaneously with the rising fiscal burden of NCDs and infectious diseases. As a report by The Lancet (2018) emphasises, failure to devise a strategy and make timely investment now will jeopardise achievement of SDG 3 (‘good health and well-being’) and target 4 of a one-third reduction in premature mortality from NCDs by 2030.

NCD morbidity and mortality as shares of total morbidity and mortality have risen steadily in India. In 1990, NCDs accounted for 40% of all Indian mortality and are now projected to account for three quarters of all deaths by 2030. Currently, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, respiratory illness and diabetes are the leading causes of deaths in India, accounting for almost 50% of all deaths (The Lancet, 2018).

Underlying these rising shares are growing risks that are common to several NCDs. These include tobacco use, alcohol abuse, and obesity due to sedentary lifestyles and diets that are getting to be increasingly high in simple carbohydrates and saturated fats. Many populations, particularly in remote rural areas, lack easy or frequent access to primary health-care practitioners who can provide regular screenings for common NCDs.

### Impact of social security schemes

The focus here is on diabetes and heart diseases. The writers of this article examine whether participation in social security measures/schemes reduces the prevalence of two specific NCDs followed by whether utilisation of medical services/hospital visits also reduces the prevalence of NCDs. As the India Human Development Survey 2015 is the only all-India panel survey to date, the analysis is based on this survey, supplemented by Longitudinal Aging Study in India (LASI 2017-18) conducted jointly by the **International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS) and Harvard School of Public Health**.

Even though pension amounts are meagre, they supplement scanty resources of the elderly poor in covering health-care expenses and thus reduce the NCDs. For treatment of such diseases, hospital visits are unavoidable. However, travel costs, fees and costs of medicines impose a huge financial burden, resulting in large out-of-pocket expenditure and indebtedness and immiseration. While health insurance is useful in restricting the financial burden, this potential is far from fully realised due to limited awareness of eligibility requirements, elaborate documentation, delays in payments, and rejection of claims.

Diets high in refined grain intake cause an increased risk of premature coronary artery disease while rice intake beyond a threshold causes diabetes. Higher intake of red meats such as beef, pork and mutton also contribute to higher risks of diabetes and heart diseases. Besides, a rise in the price ratios of fat-dense foods (sugar and oil) aggravates the risk of both diabetes and heart disease.

Confirming the age gradient, the risks of diabetes and heart diseases are positively associated with age. There are various reasons why diabetes rises with age such as a sedentary lifestyle, high-calorie diet, visceral adiposity, and high genetic predisposition mellitus (type 2) diabetes among Indians at a much younger age and at a lower body mass index (BMI) than the western population.

Of particular importance is the Ayushman Bharat Scheme that aims to provide health insurance coverage to the bottom 40% of households. But its potential has been far from fully realised due to inadequate funding and stringent eligibility requirements, and colossal corruption as revealed by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) 2023 (for example, large numbers of ineligible beneficiaries, long delays in empanelment of hospitals, surgeries performed after discharge, and utilisation certificates without signature of competent authorities). However, insurance alone might not be sufficient to achieve access to quality care, which depends on health-care infrastructure, provider availability, and local culture.

### Hospital expenses

As private hospitals are notorious for inflated prices of health care, the Supreme Court of India directed the central government in February 2024 to find ways to regulate the rates of hospital procedures. As the Court observed, pricing decisions must be informed by a benchmark for price determination. While price caps do influence actors’ behaviour by making them follow the regulations, these effects tend to be temporary when enforcement mechanisms are weak.

Behavioural changes are no less important, and perhaps also no less challenging. Lack of physical activity and unbalanced high-calorie diet promote weight gains. Obesity is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and diabetes and can aggravate risks of cardiovascular disease such as emphysema and bronchitis. Limiting tobacco consumption is expected to have benefits at the individual level but wider reduction in multi-morbidity prevalence requires taxation on unhealthy products.

In conclusion, if and when these policy reforms will be carried out is anybody’s guess.

> The World Bank’s September 2024 report, *Unlocking the Power of Healthy Longevity: Demographic Change, Non-communicable Diseases, and Human Capital*, highlights a significant demographic shift with an aging global population, especially in Low-and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). This shift coincides with a rise in non-communicable diseases (NCDs) as the primary cause of death in these regions. NCDs already account for most deaths in LMICs, and this proportion is expected to increase further. The report underscores the urgent need to address these challenges, focusing on improving health outcomes and human capital to manage the implications of an aging population and rising NCD prevalence.
