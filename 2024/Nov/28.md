# Schooling in India in times of poor air quality

### **Switching Schools to Online Mode During Severe Air Pollution: A Critical Analysis**

As part of the **Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP)**, schools in Delhi were directed to shift from physical to online classes in mid-November 2024 due to hazardous air pollution levels. While this measure aims to protect children from the harmful effects of poor air quality, its scientific rationale, practicability, and benefits versus risks warrant careful examination. 

---

### **1. Air Quality and Its Health Impacts**
Delhi’s air quality has reached alarming levels, with **no ‘good’ air quality days recorded in 2024**. Air Quality Index (AQI) readings of **51-399**, though classified as moderate to very poor, still pose significant health risks, especially for vulnerable groups such as children. Levels above 400 (‘severe’) exacerbate these risks, causing respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurological issues. 

#### **Why Children Are at Risk:**
- **Higher Respiration Rates**: Children breathe more air relative to their body weight, leading to greater exposure to pollutants.
- **Immature Immune Systems**: Their developing bodies are less equipped to filter and combat toxins.
- **Long-Term Damage**: Exposure during formative years can cause chronic diseases and developmental delays.

However, poor air quality is not limited to children. Adults, especially those with pre-existing conditions, are equally vulnerable, and a reactive approach tied to arbitrary AQI cut-offs fails to protect all age groups.

---

### **2. The Shift to Online Learning**
#### **Scientific Rationale:**
Switching to online classes assumes that limiting outdoor exposure will shield children from air pollution. While it does reduce direct outdoor exposure:
- Indoor air quality in many homes, especially in densely populated and lower-income areas, is often as poor as outdoor air due to limited ventilation, cooking practices, and lack of air purifiers.
- Children may still engage in other outdoor activities, undermining the intended protection.

#### **Practicability and Equity:**
The shift to online education presents logistical and equity challenges:
- **Digital Divide**: Many families lack access to devices, stable internet, or conducive learning environments at home, exacerbating educational disparities.
- **Parental Supervision**: Working parents may find it difficult to monitor online learning, impacting children’s academic performance and engagement.
- **Effectiveness**: Online classes often fail to replicate the interactive, hands-on experience of physical classrooms, hindering learning outcomes.

---

### **3. Risks and Broader Implications**
#### **Health Risks**:
- **Physical Inactivity**: Prolonged screen time and reduced physical activity during online learning contribute to obesity and other health problems.
- **Mental Health**: Isolation from peers affects children’s social development and mental well-being.

#### **Normalizing Poor Air Quality**:
A reactive response like switching to online learning inadvertently normalizes poor air quality by failing to address root causes. It creates an illusion of action while allowing systemic pollution issues to persist.

---

### **4. Long-Term Solutions**
While short-term measures like online classes may reduce immediate exposure, addressing Delhi’s air pollution crisis requires sustained action:
1. **Systemic Pollution Control**:
   - Implement stricter emission norms for vehicles and industries.
   - Promote cleaner fuels and expand public transport networks.
   - Ban or regulate activities like stubble burning.
2. **Infrastructure Improvements**:
   - Install air purifiers in schools and public spaces.
   - Create green zones and enhance urban forestry.
3. **Public Awareness**:
   - Educate citizens on reducing indoor air pollution and adopting sustainable practices.
4. **Policy Innovation**:
   - Reduce AQI thresholds for triggering action plans to include moderate and poor levels.
   - Enforce year-round pollution mitigation measures instead of seasonal responses.

---

### **5. Conclusion**
Switching schools to online mode during severe pollution is a short-term, reactive measure with limited effectiveness. While it may offer temporary relief for some children, it does not comprehensively address the risks of poor air quality, especially for underserved populations. The focus must shift from reactive measures to proactive, long-term solutions that tackle the root causes of pollution, protect vulnerable populations, and ensure equitable access to safe learning environments. Only then can Delhi hope to overcome its air quality crisis and safeguard its residents’ health and future.

From a larger social angle, most of the actions recommended as a part of GRAP, adversely and disproportionately, impact the poor and the vulnerable in terms of wages (for the poor and the marginalised) as well as learning and nutrition (for children) losses. This is a reminder that whatever is done in the name of the policy should have a people-centric and pro-poor focus. Air quality and school functioning need a nuanced approach. India had one of the longest closures of schools during the COVID-19 period and we need to learn from those mistakes.

> ]Shifting schools to online mode during Delhi’s severe air pollution, as part of the **Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP)**, offers temporary relief but raises questions about its effectiveness and equity. While it reduces outdoor exposure for children, indoor air quality in many homes remains poor, limiting its benefits. The shift exacerbates the digital divide, hinders learning, and impacts children’s mental and physical health. Such reactive measures normalize hazardous air quality without addressing root causes. Long-term solutions like stricter pollution control, improved infrastructure, public awareness, and year-round mitigation efforts are essential to combat Delhi’s air crisis and protect public health comprehensively.

# Fair share

### **Fair Compensation for Media Companies: Balancing the Power Dynamics**

The rapid growth of the Internet and the dominance of Big Tech platforms have created a significant power imbalance between news publishers and large online enterprises. Union Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, on **National Press Day**, highlighted the urgent need for fair compensation to media companies for the use of their content by these platforms. This issue is critical to the financial sustainability and vibrancy of news organizations in India and globally, especially as Artificial Intelligence (AI) increasingly enables the large-scale appropriation of original content.

---

### **1. The Problem: Power Imbalance Between Media and Big Tech**
Big technology platforms like **Google**, **Meta**, and others benefit significantly from hosting and sharing content created by news publishers. However, they often dictate the financial terms of content use, leaving media organizations with minimal revenue from the profits generated through clicks, views, and advertisements. 

- **Loss of Revenue for Media**: Traditional news formats are already under financial pressure due to declining subscriptions and advertising revenues. Online platforms exacerbate this by utilizing media content without fair compensation.
- **Dominance of Big Tech**: These platforms leverage advanced algorithms, user data, and large-scale infrastructure to generate massive profits, overshadowing the smaller news publishers who produce the original content.

---

### **2. The Global Push for Fair Revenue Sharing**
Several countries have begun addressing this issue through new regulations aimed at restoring the balance between media companies and Big Tech:

#### **A. Australia**
- Australia enacted a **News Media Bargaining Code**, requiring tech platforms like Google and Meta to negotiate fair licensing deals with publishers.
- This law empowered media companies, compelling platforms to enter agreements and compensate for content use.

#### **B. France**
- France implemented the **EU’s Copyright Directive**, mandating revenue-sharing agreements between platforms and publishers.
- French publishers have successfully negotiated licensing deals with Google and Meta, setting a global precedent.

#### **C. Canada and the U.S.**
- Similar regulatory efforts are underway in Canada and the United States, emphasizing the importance of fair compensation for news publishers.

---

### **3. The Need for Action in India**
India, with its vast media ecosystem and a growing digital presence, faces a similar challenge. News organizations, which play a vital role in democracy by ensuring informed citizenry, are struggling to sustain themselves financially. 

- **Government Support**: The Indian government has expressed support for fair revenue sharing, but concrete action through legislation is urgently needed.
- **Threat from AI**: AI tools are increasingly capable of appropriating content stealthily, creating new business models that exploit original creators without adequate compensation.

---

### **4. Potential Challenges and Way Forward**
#### **A. Pushback from Big Tech**
- Big Tech platforms are likely to resist these measures, citing operational costs, potential disruptions, and the risk of reduced content availability.
- To counter this, the government must ensure that regulatory frameworks are fair, transparent, and enforceable.

#### **B. Formulating Robust Laws**
- Enacting legislation similar to Australia’s and France’s models will be crucial. These laws must:
  - Define clear terms for revenue sharing.
  - Ensure equitable negotiations between platforms and publishers.
  - Protect smaller publishers who may lack bargaining power.

#### **C. Strengthening Media Ecosystems**
- Encourage collaboration among media houses to negotiate better deals collectively.
- Promote digital innovation and diversification of revenue streams for media companies.

---

### **5. Conclusion**
The issue of fair compensation for media content is critical for preserving the financial sustainability and independence of news organizations. As India’s government expresses support for this cause, the time has come to translate these commitments into robust laws. With the growing influence of AI and Big Tech platforms, addressing this imbalance is not just about economics; it is about safeguarding the pillars of democracy. Prompt and decisive action will ensure that media organizations continue to thrive, offering quality journalism to an informed public.

> The dominance of Big Tech platforms like Google and Meta has created a power imbalance, where news publishers receive minimal compensation for their content. Countries like Australia and France have implemented laws mandating fair revenue-sharing agreements, benefiting media organizations. In India, the government has expressed support for such measures, emphasizing the need for legislation to ensure financial sustainability for news publishers. With Artificial Intelligence enabling large-scale content appropriation, protecting original creators is urgent. Despite expected resistance from Big Tech, India must enact robust laws to promote equitable revenue-sharing, safeguard media independence, and support journalism as a cornerstone of democracy.

# The right to work deleted

Central to the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) is the legal right to work for 100 days per year per rural household. Each household gets a unique job card containing the list of all its registered adults. One cannot work in MGNREGA without a job card. Addition of new members to job cards happens upon furnishing appropriate documents establishing adulthood.

Schedule II, Paragraph 23 of the Act outlines the procedure for deletions of workers from job cards — “If the Gram panchayat is satisfied at anytime that a person has registered with it by furnishing false information, it may direct the Programme Officer to direct his name to be struck off from the register and direct the applicant to return the job card:” Regarding due process, it says that a deleted worker, if alive, must be “given an opportunity of being heard in the presence of two independent persons.”

### Guidelines for deletion

Implementation guidelines for MGNREGA are available in Master Circulars which are released either annually or once in two years by the Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD). The Master Circular from 2021-22 specifies clear protocols for worker deletions as follows. A job card can only be deleted under the following situations: (a) when a household permanently migrates, (b) the job card is found to be a duplicate, (c) it was issued based on forged documents.

Additionally, if a Gram Panchayat is reclassified as a Municipal Corporation, all job cards in that panchayat are deleted. In line with the Act, the circular emphasises due process, requiring independent verification by the Programme Officer before any deletions. Moreover, all deletions must be documented, reported to the Gram Sabha/Ward Sabha, and updated in the MGNREGA Management Information System (MIS). The MIS is the digital architecture of MGNREGA. Beyond the listed reasons, the MGNREGA MIS has dropdowns in its menu with 12 reasons for deletions of workers and job cards. Some of which are “Duplicate Applicant”, “Fake Applicant“, “Not willing to work” etc.

In 2021-22, 1.49 crore workers were deleted, which surged to 5.53 crore in 2022-23 resulting in a 247% increase in deletions in 2022-23. In the last four years, names of 10.43 crore MGNREGA workers across India have been deleted.

The surge of deletions in 2022-23 coincided with the period when the Union Government issued several circulars making Aadhaar-based payment systems (ABPS) mandatory in MGNREGA. For ABPS to work, as a first step, every worker’s Aadhaar number had to be seeded with her job card. Senior officials rely on the percentage of workers whose Aadhaar has been seeded with their respective job cards as a metric of compliance. Strict diktats were issued to field officials to increase this percentage.

In response to questions in the Lok Sabha on February 6, 2024, regarding worker deletions in MGNREGA, the Minister of State for Rural Development, Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti, in a written reply stated: “Updation and deletion of job cards is a regular exercise conducted by the States and Union Territories under MGNREGS. These actions are undertaken to maintain accuracy and transparency.” However, a paper published in the Economic and Political Weekly by Chakradhar Buddha and Laavanya Tamang establishes how field officials resorted to deleting job cards without verification in a rush to increase ABPS compliance percentage. Deleting workers is akin to reducing the denominator to make the fraction bigger.

### **Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA)**

The **Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA)**, enacted in **2005**, is a landmark legislation in India aimed at ensuring the right to work as a means to promote rural development, reduce poverty, and strengthen livelihood security.

   - Reduces rural-to-urban migration by providing work opportunities within villages.

5. **Environmental Benefits**:
   - Projects like afforestation and water conservation contribute to environmental sustainability.

---

### **Challenges**
1. **Delayed Payments**:
   - Significant delays in wage payments often discourage workers.
2. **Corruption**:
   - Instances of misuse of funds and ghost beneficiaries hinder effective implementation.
3. **Inadequate Work Allocation**:
   - Some rural households do not receive the full 100 days of work due to administrative inefficiencies.
4. **Low Wages**:
   - MGNREGA wages in some states are lower than prevailing market rates.

---

### **Conclusion**
MGNREGA is a transformative program that ensures rural livelihood security, promotes inclusive development, and empowers marginalized communities. While it has made significant contributions to poverty alleviation and rural development, addressing issues like delayed payments, corruption, and inadequate implementation is crucial to enhance its effectiveness. Strengthening MGNREGA can play a pivotal role in achieving sustainable development and reducing rural poverty in India.
