# Timely reiteration

The Supreme Court of India has done well to rebuff an attempt to question the characterisation of the country as **‘secular’** and **‘socialist’** in the amended Preamble to the Constitution. Sections of the right wing have been uneasy for long about the identification of secularism as one of the attributes of India. This opposition has acquired traction among those who see the combination of the state not favouring or opposing any religion and the constitutional protection for minorities as something that renders the polity **“pseudo-secular”**. The original assumption of the makers of the Constitution was that the Constitution — with its emphasis on equality before law and equal treatment of all sections, besides the incorporation of the right to profess, practise and propagate any religion and freedom of belief and conscience in the fundamental rights chapter — is inherently secular. In terms of economic policy, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar opposed amendments to include the word ‘socialist’ by arguing that the Constituent Assembly should not tie down future generations to any particular form of economy. Therefore, the words did not form part of the Preamble adopted along with the Constitution in 1949, but were controversially added through the 42nd Amendment enacted during the Emergency. However, that may not be reason enough for the courts to strike down their inclusion based on writ petitions filed in 2020, about 44 years after the amendment.

The Court, in **S.R. Bommai (1994)**, ruled that secularism is a basic feature of the Constitution. In another case, it said: “Secularism essentially represents the nation’s commitment to treat persons of all faiths equally and without discrimination.” Regarding the term ‘socialist’, it is clear that its presence in the Preamble has not been an impediment to adoption of laws or policies and practices that open up sectors of the economy to open market competition. As the Bench of Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar has pointed out, India has developed its own interpretation of secularism, “wherein the State neither supports any religion nor penalises the profession and practice of any faith”. Similarly, the term ‘socialism’ embodies “the principle of economic and social justice, wherein the State ensures that no citizen is disadvantaged due to economic or social circumstances”. The Court has not countenanced the argument that the inclusion of these words came during the Emergency, when Parliament’s term was extended, noting that this aspect was debated in Parliament in 1978 when the 44th Amendment Act was considered. As the Constitution completes 75 years of existence, the verdict upholding the inclusion of the terms ‘secular’ and ‘socialist’ amounts to a timely reiteration of these fundamental attributes.

The **S.R. Bommai v. Union of India** case is a landmark judgment by the Supreme Court of India that significantly impacted the interpretation and application of **Article 356** of the Indian Constitution, which pertains to the imposition of President's Rule in states.

**Background:**
In April 1989, the Janata Dal government in Karnataka, led by Chief Minister **S.R. Bommai**, was dismissed by the Governor, citing loss of majority due to defections. President's Rule was imposed without allowing Bommai to prove his majority on the floor of the Assembly. Bommai challenged this dismissal, leading to a legal battle that culminated in the Supreme Court.

**Key Issues Addressed:**
1. **Justiciability of Presidential Proclamation:** The Court examined whether the President's decision to impose President's Rule under Article 356 is subject to judicial review.
2. **Scope of Judicial Review:** It assessed the extent to which courts can scrutinize the material and reasons behind the proclamation.
3. **Floor Test Requirement:** The necessity of a floor test in the Assembly to determine the majority support for the government was evaluated.
4. **Secularism as a Basic Feature:** The Court considered whether non-secular actions by a state government could justify the imposition of President's Rule.

**Judgment Highlights:**
- **Judicial Review Affirmed:** The Supreme Court held that the President's proclamation under Article 356 is not immune from judicial review. Courts can examine whether the proclamation was based on relevant material and whether the power was exercised in a bona fide manner.
- **Necessity of Floor Test:** The Court emphasized that the proper course to test a government's majority is through a floor test in the Assembly. Dismissal without allowing this test is unconstitutional.
- **Secularism as a Basic Feature:** The judgment reinforced that **secularism** is a basic feature of the Constitution. State governments acting against secular principles can be valid grounds for invoking Article 356.
- **Revival of Dissolved Assemblies:** If a proclamation is found unconstitutional, the dissolved Legislative Assembly can be revived.

**Implications:**
The **S.R. Bommai** case set strict guidelines to prevent the misuse of Article 356, ensuring that elected state governments cannot be arbitrarily dismissed by the central government. It strengthened the federal structure and upheld the democratic process by mandating that the majority of a government should be tested on the floor of the Assembly.

This judgment remains a cornerstone in Indian constitutional law, safeguarding the autonomy of state governments and reinforcing the principles of democracy and federalism.

> The **Supreme Court of India** recently upheld the inclusion of the words **"Socialist"** and **"Secular"** in the **Preamble** of the Constitution through the **42nd Amendment Act, 1976**, dismissing challenges to their validity. Petitioners argued the inclusion was retrospective and altered the Constitution's intent, claiming these terms were deliberately excluded by the **Constituent Assembly**. The Court ruled that the Preamble is an **inalienable part** of the Constitution and can be amended under **Article 368** as long as it adheres to the **basic structure doctrine**. It emphasized that these words reflect values already embedded in the Constitution, reaffirming India’s democratic and pluralistic ethos.

# SC ruling on socialism, secularism

A Division Bench of the Supreme Court led by the Chief Justice of India dismissed pleas challenging the inclusion of the words ‘socialist’ and ‘secular’ in the Preamble to our Constitution.

### What is the history of Preamble?

The original Preamble adopted on November 26, 1949, declared India a sovereign, democratic, republic. Our Constituent Assembly consciously avoided the word ‘socialist’ as they felt that declaring the economic ideal of a country in its Constitution’s preamble was not appropriate. People should decide what suits them according to time and age.

Likewise, Indian secularism is different from western secularism. In the latter, the state and religion are strictly separated and the government does not interfere in religious affairs. However, in India, the state enjoys the power to regulate the economic, financial, political and secular aspects associated with religious practice. It can also provide for social welfare and reform in religious practices. Further, various provisions of the Constitution that include right to practise any religion, non-discrimination on the basis of religion in any affairs of the state embodied the ‘secular’ values of our Constitution. Hence, in the Constituent Assembly, the amendment to introduce the word ‘secular’ in the Preamble was not accepted.

In Berubari case (1960), the Supreme Court opined that the Preamble is not a part of the Constitution and thus not a source of any substantive power. Subsequently, in Kesavananda Bharati case (1973), the Supreme Court reversed its earlier opinion and said that the Preamble is part of the Constitution and that it should be read and interpreted in the light of the vision envisioned in the Preamble. It also held that the Preamble is subject to the amending power of Parliament as any other provision of the Constitution. The 42nd Constitutional Amendment in 1976 inserted the words ‘Socialist’, ‘Secular’ and ‘Integrity’ in the Preamble.

### What was the current case?

The current case was filed by former Rajya Sabha MP Subramanian Swamy, advocate Ashwini Upadhyay and others. Mr. Upadhyay and others had opposed the insertion of the words ‘socialist’ and ‘secular’ in the Preamble. They argued that these were included during the Emergency and forced the people to follow specific ideologies. They felt that since the date of adoption by the Constituent Assembly was mentioned in the Preamble, no additional words can be inserted later by Parliament. Mr. Swamy was of the view that subsequent amendments to the Constitution including the 44th Amendment in 1978 during Janata Party rule after emergency had supported and retained these two words. Nevertheless, he was of the view that these words should appear in a separate paragraph below the original Preamble.

### What did the court rule?

The court dismissed the pleas and held that ‘socialism’ and ‘secularism’ are integral to the basic structure of the Constitution. It observed that the Constitution is a ‘living document’ subject to the amendment power of Parliament. This amending power extends to the Preamble as well and the date of adoption mentioned in it does not restrict such power. The court opined that ‘socialism’ in the Indian context primarily means a welfare state that provides equality of opportunity and does not prevent the private sector from thriving. Similarly, over time India has developed its own interpretation of ‘secularism’. The state neither supports any religion nor penalises the profession and practice of any faith. In essence, the concept of secularism represents one of the facets of right to equality.

### Why is it important?

The initial years after Independence fostered ‘democratic socialism’ characterised by centralised planning and many industries being established by the state. The period of 1960s and 70s saw nationalisation of banks and insurance, higher tax rates and various regulations. The economy, though declared as mixed economy where public and private enterprises would co-exist, displayed the characteristics of classical socialism with license controls and regulations. Starting from 1991, our economy has evolved from such socialistic pattern to a market-oriented model. The ensuing growth has uplifted vast majority of people from abject poverty in the last three decades. However, there is also growing inequality that needs to be addressed. As the court observed, our socialism continues to address the needs of the poor through schemes such as MGNREGA, subsidised food grains, direct benefit transfers for women and farmers etc. Hence, it is imperative that such socialism continues to guide the actions of the state for the welfare of the needy while private enterprise flourishes resulting in increased employment and strong economic growth. The spirit of our ‘unity in diversity’ should be equally preserved by upholding the values of secularism.

> The **Supreme Court of India** upheld the inclusion of **"Socialism"** and **"Secularism"** in the **Preamble** through the **42nd Amendment Act, 1976**, dismissing claims that the terms were inconsistent with the Constitution's original intent. Petitioners argued that the words imposed ideological constraints and altered the Constitution retrospectively. However, the Court ruled that the Preamble is an **integral part** of the Constitution and can be amended under **Article 368**, provided the basic structure remains intact. The Court affirmed that "socialism" ensures economic justice, while "secularism" guarantees equal respect for all religions, reflecting principles already embedded in the Constitution’s values and framework.

# SC seeks report on Pennaiyar water sharing between T.N. and Karnataka

### **The Pennaiyar River: A Lifeline for Tamil Nadu and Karnataka**

The **Pennaiyar River**, also known as the **South Pennar River**, is an important river flowing through the states of **Karnataka** and **Tamil Nadu**. It plays a significant role in the socio-economic and ecological systems of the regions it traverses. However, disputes over its water sharing have led to conflicts, necessitating intervention from the Supreme Court of India, which has recently sought a report on water sharing between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.

---

### **Geographical Overview**
1. **Origin and Course**:
   - The Pennaiyar River originates from the **Nandi Hills** in the **Chikkaballapura district** of Karnataka.
   - It flows southeast for approximately **497 kilometers**, passing through Karnataka and Tamil Nadu before emptying into the **Bay of Bengal** near Cuddalore.

2. **Tributaries**:
   - Major tributaries include the **Chinnar**, **Markandeya**, and **Vaniyar** rivers.

3. **Catchment Area**:
   - The river’s catchment spans parts of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu, supporting agricultural activities and local livelihoods.

---

### **Significance**
1. **Agriculture**:

# From a republic to a republic of unequals

Constitution day on November 26, 2024 marked 75 years of the adoption of the Constitution and constitutional governance in independent India. The Constituent Assembly debates show the intellectual engagement of leaders from a spectrum of ideologies, right wing to left wing, in building a single political identity that was accommodative of the interests and rights of multiple cultural groups.

The Constitution-makers accepted the liberal framework, but wanted the state to play a positive role in intervening and reducing inequality due to poor social indicators at the time of Independence. With liberalism, as a political ideology, there was an insistence that there should be freedom for citizens to carry out activities without any state interference. There was the belief that only in a free environment could human potentialities, be they intellectual, moral and physical, be realised. Thus, liberty became the core value of liberalism.

The Indian Constitution makers agreed to create a liberal political state in India. But considering the social and economic inequalities, they felt that a complete withdrawal of the state would perpetuate the existing inequalities and worsen it further. So, it was that the state should be given a positive role to intervene and create conditions for everyone to participate equally in the development process. Thus, affirmative action and reservation policies to treat unequals in an unequal manner to achieve the constitutional vision of equality have become an important aspect of the Indian Constitution.

### An egalitarian outlook

Its vision of equality aims to create an egalitarian society to minimise economic inequalities among the people. Reflecting John Rawls’ egalitarian liberalism, including the three important principles of equal basic liberties, equal opportunities and difference, the Constitution aims to create an egalitarian society. The fundamental rights in Part III and the Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP) in Part IV of the Constitution reflect all the above three principles of egalitarian liberalism. Thus egalitarian liberalism aims to reduce inequality and not create an absolute equal society. Article 38(2) of DPSP insists that the state shall strive to minimise the inequalities of income and eliminate inequalities in status, facilities and opportunities. The constitutional ideological framework lays emphasis on reducing inequalities and creating an egalitarian society based on equal opportunities and facilities through state intervention. Further, Article 39(c) emphasises that the economic system ought not to result in a concentration of wealth and means of production to the common detriment.

The Supreme Court of India has reiterated this principle in many of its judgments till the end of the 1990s. In D.S. Nakara & Others vs Union Of India (1982), the Court said that the basic framework of socialism in the Constitution is to provide a decent standard of life to the working people and social security from cradle to grave, reiterating the role of the welfare state in India. In Air India Statutory Corporation vs United Labour Union & Ors (1996), the Court said that the ideological aspects of the Indian Constitution found in the Preamble, Fundamental Rights and DPSP aim to establish an egalitarian social order, protecting social and economic justice and the dignity of individual by providing equality of status and opportunities.

In Samatha vs State of Andhra Pradesh & Ors. (1997), the Court interpreted that the meaning of the word “socialism” in the Constitution is to reduce inequalities in income and provide equal opportunities and facilities to create an egalitarian social order. Justice V.R. Krishna Iyer’s interpretation of Article 39(b) of the DPSP, in State Of Karnataka And Anr Etc vs Shri Ranganatha Reddy & Anr. Etc, that public and private resources fall within the ambit of community resources, was in line with the constitutional ideology of creating an egalitarian society by strengthening the state’s power of redistribution of resources for common good towards reducing inequality.

But recently, the Court overturned this interpretation without locating it within Article 39(c), which empowers the state to intervene and regulate the economic system to prevent the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few towards creating an egalitarian society.

### Economic reforms and inequality

After the adoption of neoliberal economic reforms in India, the constitutional ideology took a back seat and the idea of a welfare state as envisaged in the Constitution has withdrawn its commitments towards creating an egalitarian society. Lucas Chancel and Thomas Piketty from the Paris School of Economics have documented the rising inequality in India in their work, “Indian Income Inequality, 1922-2015: From British Raj to Billionaire Raj?” (2019).

Their research shows that the top 1% of earners had a share of less than 21% of total income in the 1930s. But after Independence, due to welfare state intervention, based on constitutional ideology, this gap reduced where the top 1% earners had a share of 6% of the total income in the 1980s.

After the implementation of neoliberal reforms in the 1990s, there were major structural changes that happened in the Indian economy, which prioritised private capital investment and a slow withdrawal of the welfare interventionist state. The state took the positive role of creating and strengthening markets rather than working towards creating an egalitarian society, as envisaged in the Constitution. As a consequence of this, the top 1% income has reached 22% of the total income pushing back to an inequality situation worse than that in the pre-Independence period. They reiterated this inequality status in their recent research in 2024 emphasising that the top 1% of income and wealth shares have reached 22.6% and 40.1% by 2022-23, which is considered very high.

The “State of Inequality in India Report” (2022), prepared by the Institute for Competitiveness (commissioned by the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister), highlighted the Periodic Labour Force Survey 2019-20, which recorded that average monthly wages of ₹25,000 (₹3 lakh an annum) is being earned by the top 10% and the remaining 90% earn less than ₹.25,000 a month. This shows extreme inequality and how the majority are being pushed into poverty, violating constitutional ideology.

### An overlap with social inequality

Further, the report titled “Towards Tax Justice and Wealth redistribution in India” (2024 by the World Inequality Lab at the Paris School of Economics), has brought in evidence to show how economic inequality and social inequality overlap in India. By 2022-23, 90% of the billionaire wealth was held by the upper castes in India. Scheduled Tribes are not present in billionaire wealth. Other Backward Classes (OBC) have a mere 10% presence and Scheduled Castes have a 2.6% representation in billionaire wealth. The report further emphasises that between 2014 and 2022, the OBC share has reduced from 20% to 10% and upper caste share has increased from 80% to 90% in billionaire wealth. The upper castes are the only group which owns wealth more than its proportion of population, reiterating how social capital and economic advantages are overlapping in India. Further, Oxfam International highlights the rise in the number of billionaires from nine in the year 2000 to 119 in 2023. It further compares income inequality and shows that it will take 941 years for a minimum wage earner to earn what a top corporate executive earns a year in India.

The constitutional vision of creating an egalitarian social order by minimising income inequality and eliminating social inequality is under threat from the neoliberal ideological order. Violating the constitutional ideology, inequality levels are widening, strengthening wealth concentration among the few. Further, social inequality overlaps with economic inequality to give the upper castes a greater advantage in contemporary India.

> India, founded as a republic committed to **equality, justice, and fraternity**, is increasingly grappling with deepening inequalities. Economic disparities, with the richest 1% holding a disproportionate share of wealth, highlight growing economic divides. Social inequalities persist, driven by caste, gender, and regional disparities, undermining the constitutional promise of equality. Political power is often concentrated among elites, sidelining marginalized voices. These trends challenge India's foundational ideals and risk turning it into a **republic of unequals**. Addressing this requires urgent reforms in wealth redistribution, affirmative action, and inclusive governance to realign the nation with its constitutional values of justice and equality.

# Between hope and hurdles on the high seas

### **Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) Agreement: The High Seas Treaty**

The **Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) Agreement**, commonly referred to as the **High Seas Treaty**, is a landmark international treaty aimed at the sustainable use and conservation of marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction. These areas, which include the **high seas** and the **deep-sea bed**, cover nearly **two-thirds of the world's oceans** and are crucial for maintaining global ecological balance. Negotiated under the auspices of the **United Nations**, the treaty was finalized in **March 2023**, marking a significant step toward global environmental governance.

---

### **1. Importance of the High Seas**
- **Global Commons**: The high seas are not under any single nation’s jurisdiction, making their governance a shared international responsibility.
- **Biodiversity Reservoir**: These areas harbor a vast array of marine life, from plankton to whales, contributing to ecological stability and supporting global food chains.
- **Climate Regulation**: Oceans absorb a significant portion of the planet’s carbon dioxide and heat, playing a critical role in mitigating climate change.
- **Economic Value**: High seas support industries like fishing, shipping, and deep-sea mining, which contribute to global economies but often exploit these resources unsustainably.

---

### **2. Objectives of the BBNJ Agreement**
The treaty aims to:
1. **Protect Marine Biodiversity**: Prevent the overexploitation of marine resources and safeguard endangered species and ecosystems.
2. **Establish Marine Protected Areas (MPAs)**: Create a framework for setting up **protected zones** in the high seas to preserve biodiversity.
3. **Regulate Human Activities**: Manage activities such as fishing, deep-sea mining, and shipping to minimize their environmental impact.
4. **Benefit Sharing**: Ensure equitable access to marine genetic resources and their benefits, particularly for developing nations.
5. **Promote Scientific Research**: Facilitate international collaboration in marine research while ensuring transparency and access to data.
6. **Capacity Building**: Support developing countries with technology transfer, funding, and training to participate in ocean conservation efforts.

---

### **3. Key Provisions**
1. **Marine Protected Areas (MPAs)**:
   - The treaty establishes a process to designate **protected zones** where activities harmful to biodiversity are restricted or prohibited.
2. **Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs)**:
   - Nations must conduct **EIAs** for activities in the high seas to evaluate their potential impact on marine ecosystems.
3. **Equitable Benefit Sharing**:
   - Benefits from marine genetic resources, such as pharmaceuticals derived from deep-sea organisms, must be shared equitably among nations, particularly with developing countries.
4. **Global Cooperation**:
   - The treaty mandates cooperation among countries, fostering transparency and accountability in the use of marine resources.

---

### **4. Challenges in Implementation**
- **Enforcement**: Ensuring compliance in vast, unregulated ocean areas is complex and requires robust monitoring systems.
- **Funding**: Developing nations need financial and technological support to implement conservation measures.
- **Coordination**: Aligning the treaty’s provisions with existing frameworks, such as the **United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)**, poses logistical challenges.
- **Resistance from Industries**: Fishing, shipping, and mining industries may resist regulations that could limit their operations.

---

### **5. Significance**
- **Conservation Milestone**: The BBNJ Agreement is a critical step in addressing marine biodiversity loss and protecting ecosystems vital for global health and prosperity.
- **Climate Action**: By regulating human activities, the treaty contributes to the fight against climate change, ensuring oceans continue to function as carbon sinks.
- **Equity**: It upholds the principles of equity and fairness by enabling developing nations to benefit from marine genetic resources and participate in decision-making.

---

### **6. The Road Ahead**
The successful implementation of the **High Seas Treaty** requires:
- **Global Collaboration**: Countries must work together to establish MPAs and enforce conservation measures.
- **Technological Innovation**: Developing advanced tools for monitoring and enforcement in international waters.
- **Awareness and Advocacy**: Promoting the importance of ocean conservation among industries, governments, and citizens.

---

### **Conclusion**
The **BBNJ Agreement** marks a historic achievement in global environmental governance, addressing the urgent need to protect the high seas and their biodiversity. By fostering international cooperation, equity, and sustainable practices, the treaty lays the foundation for safeguarding the oceans for future generations. However, its success hinges on effective implementation, robust funding, and the collective will of the international community to prioritize the health of the planet over short-term economic gains.

India’s recent signing of the Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) Agreement — better known as the High Seas Treaty — has drawn both praise and scepticism from maritime observers. Hailed as a landmark step in ocean governance, the treaty seeks to protect marine ecosystems and promote the sustainable use of resources in areas beyond national jurisdiction. However, despite its laudable intentions to address critical gaps in international maritime regulation, the pact’s structural complexities and potential challenges warrant examination.

As the third implementing agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the BBNJ treaty follows earlier accords on deep-sea mining and fisheries management. Its provisions focus on three objectives: conserving marine biodiversity, ensuring equitable sharing of benefits from marine genetic resources, and mandating environmental impact assessments for harmful activities. Yet, like many ambitious multilateral agreements, it risks faltering against geopolitical rivalries, jurisdictional overlap, and weak enforcement mechanisms.

### Fraught with challenges

The treaty’s ambitious goals are tempered by its lack of a clear implementation roadmap. With only 14 of its 104 signatories having ratified the agreement, it remains far from the required threshold of 60 needed to come into force. Much of the hesitation stems from disputes over maritime territories, particularly in regions such as the South China Sea, where overlapping claims complicate consensus on Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). Southeast Asian nations remain divided on whether high-seas “national parks” could affect territorial claims or limit economic opportunities for coastal communities that depend on marine resources. Bay of Bengal states echo similar apprehensions about MPAs affecting livelihood and resource access, underscoring the broader regional hesitations surrounding the treaty’s implementation. Critics argue that the treaty’s emphasis on the “high-seas principle” risks overshadowing the “common heritage of mankind” concept, which prioritizes preservation over access. One of the treaty’s most contentious provisions involves marine genetic resources. The treaty obligates nations to share the profits derived from exploiting these resources through a global fund. However, without robust accountability measures, this provision risks being undermined by wealthier nations underreporting their activities. The pact also risks conflicting with regimes like the Convention on Biological Diversity, potentially disadvantaging smaller states and fragmenting enforcement.

Capacity-building and technology transfers present yet another challenge for low and middle-income countries. The treaty calls for equitable partnerships in ocean science, but lacks enforceable mechanisms, leaving less capable nations vulnerable to being sidelined. Asymmetry threatens to perpetuate inequalities in maritime research and governance.

The treaty’s focus on the high seas overlooks the interconnectedness of marine ecosystems, where harmful activities in EEZs often cascade into international waters. The 2021 X-Press Pearl disaster off Sri Lanka, which spilled hazardous chemicals into the Indian Ocean, is a stark reminder of how localised incidents can have global repercussions. Similarly, overfishing within the EEZs in West Africa has depleted fish stocks far beyond national jurisdictions, exacerbating marine resource scarcity on the high seas

While the BBNJ Agreement aspires to reshape global ocean governance, its potential hinges on bridging the gap between ambition and action. Its greatest limitation lies in failing to reconcile high-seas governance with coastal regulations, assuming international waters can be managed in isolation despite the impact of pollution, overfishing, and habitat destruction in EEZs.

More troubling is the reluctance of coastal states to assume greater responsibility for activities within their waters. While the treaty mandates environmental impact assessments (EIAs) for planned activities, it remains silent on the damaging harms during oil and gas exploration — that the pact does not cover — and which constitutes an important economic interest of states. This gap, compounded by the disinclination of states to accept an international review of EIAs, exposes the inherent weaknesses in the treaty’s enforcement framework, particularly in regions with weak institutional capacity and conflicting domestic and international legal standards.

### Bridging the divide

For the High Seas Treaty to succeed, it must overcome its structural and political limitations. This requires a radical shift in maritime governance — one that integrates high-seas and coastal regulations into a cohesive framework. Coastal states, particularly those in the Global South, need incentives to align their domestic laws with international norms, while wealthier nations must commit to providing technical and financial support to ensure the treaty’s benefits are equitably shared.

The treaty’s success ultimately hinges on fostering a collective commitment among nations to safeguard the oceans as a shared global resource. Without political consensus, clear strategies, and enforceable mechanisms, the BBNJ risks becoming an ineffective instrument — an outcome the oceans, already under immense stress, cannot afford.

> The **Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) Agreement**, or **High Seas Treaty**, finalized in 2023, aims to protect and sustainably manage biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction, covering nearly two-thirds of the oceans. It establishes provisions for **Marine Protected Areas (MPAs)**, **Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs)**, equitable sharing of marine genetic resources, and global cooperation. The treaty addresses challenges like overfishing, deep-sea mining, and climate change, ensuring benefits for developing nations through funding and capacity building. Despite implementation challenges, such as enforcement and funding, the treaty is a historic milestone in global ocean conservation, fostering equity and sustainability for future generations.

# Six decades since Thumba launch, slew of private entities prepare for flight

November 21 was 61 years since the birth of the Indian space programme. On this date in 1963, scientists launched a Nike-Apache sounding rocket from Thumba in Kerala. These rockets helped the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) master the solid propellant technology powering India’s launch vehicles today. Around the same time as this anniversary, India launched its first satellite onboard a SpaceX rocket even as multiple Indian private sector entities geared up for launches of their own.

### Launches of merit

NewSpace India, Ltd. launched the 4,700-kg GSAT-N2/GSAT-20 satellite onboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Florida. N2 wasn’t launched onboard an Indian launch vehicle because its weight exceeded the payload capacity of the country’s most powerful rocket, the LVM-3, which can place satellites weighing up to four tonnes in the geostationary transfer orbit (GTO). INSAT-1D was the last such satellite launched from Florida, in 1990.

GSAT-N2 is a Ka-band high throughput communication satellite built by ISRO to enhance broadband services in underserved areas, including the northeast, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, and Lakshadweep. It will also support services like in-flight internet connectivity and the Smart Cities Mission.

The satellite was placed in a GTO with a perigee of 250 km, an apogee of 59,730 km, and at a 27.5°inclination. From here, the satellite will use its thrusters to move to a geostationary orbit at 63° E longitude over the next few days.

Next, ISRO is preparing to launch its PSLV-C59 mission bearing the European Proba-3 mission. The Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) will fly in its extended length configuration (XL), which was last used to launch Aditya-L1 in September 2023.

The twin Proba spacecraft to study the Sun arrived in Chennai on November 6 and will be integrated with the launch vehicle. Liftoff is currently scheduled for 4 p.m. IST on December 4.

India’s astronaut-designate Shubhanshu Shukla, who is set to fly to the International Space Station in 2025, is undergoing training at the European Space Agency’s European Astronaut Centre. This part of the training is to familiarise astronauts-to-be with the European modules of the space station.

### From the private sector

Four Indian private companies are preparing to launch their payloads/satellites into orbit.

Pixxel, which is Indian-American, unveiled ‘Fireflies’, its six hyperspectral satellites expected to be launched early next year. Each satellite weighs around 50 kg, has a native 5 m spatial resolution, and scans 40-km swaths for data in more than 150 spectral bands. These satellites constitute the first batch in what is eventually expected to become a constellation of 24 satellites. These satellites are capable of providing data that can help detect crop diseases, water-stressed areas, real-time deforestation, and ocean pollution early.

Second, GalaxEye Space is flying its “It’s NOT a Satellite, It’s Just a Tech Demo” on board the PSLV’s Orbital Experimental Module (POEM) platform. This is when the final stage of a PSLV finishes deploying its payload and enters earth orbit, becoming an orbital platform where onboard instruments can run experiments. The Tech Demo will test subsystems of a synthetic aperture radar (SAR).

PierSight Space will also fly a mission on a PSLV POEM called ‘Varuna’, which will demonstrate a deployable reflectarray antenna and test SAR and aeronautical information service avionics in orbit.

HEX20 will fly its ‘Nila’ satellite onboard SpaceX’s Transporter 13 mission in February 2025. ‘Nila’ is a 5-kg cubesat that can host different payloads and provide data-processing services. A ground station will be built in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, to control and receive data from the satellite.

Catalyx Space’s SR-0 satellite launched onboard the third developmental flight of the Small Satellite Launch Vehicle mission re-entered the earth’s atmosphere on November 3. The company announced the satellite had achieved all its objectives in its three-month lifespan.

AAKA Space Studio launched India’s first Space Analog Mission in Leh, Ladakh, in collaboration with the ISRO Human Spaceflight Centre, IIT-Bombay, and the University of Ladakh. The site was chosen for its similarity to surfaces on the moon and Mars.

One person from AAKA Space Studio will stay in the habitat in Leh for 21 days to test habitat sustainability, life-support systems, and the human experience of isolation.

SatSure is working with the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology for “automated image feature extraction models for building footprints, roof type, roads, and water bodies among other classes for more than two lakh villages”. This is the Indian government’s largest programme to map rural property. Drones under the government’s ‘Svamvita’ programme will capture images of 3-5 cm resolution and SatSure will use its machine-learning tools developed for satellite data to extract and classify the relevant features.

### Space science updates

India celebrated its full membership of the Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO), an international effort to build the world’s most advanced radio telescope in Australia and South Africa. India will contribute cash as well as advanced electronics and engineering for telescope components in exchange for scientific data collected by the telescope.

> Six decades after the first rocket launch from **Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station** in 1963, India’s space ecosystem is witnessing a transformative shift with private players entering the sector. Enabled by the government's push for **space sector privatization** and the establishment of **Indian National Space Promotion and Authorization Center (IN-SPACe)**, numerous private entities are developing cutting-edge technologies for satellite launches, space exploration, and data services. Startups like **Skyroot Aerospace** and **Agnikul Cosmos** have achieved significant milestones, fostering innovation and competition. This evolution positions India as a global leader in affordable and accessible space services, complementing ISRO’s established capabilities.
