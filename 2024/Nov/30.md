# Plastics treaty draft skips key issue: limiting production

The preliminary draft of the **Global Plastics Treaty**, finalized after five days of deliberations at the **United Nations-led negotiations** in Busan, South Korea, marks a significant yet contentious step in addressing the global plastic pollution crisis. The treaty's core purpose is to limit the production, trade, and harmful effects of plastics and their constituent chemicals, but its current framework has sparked mixed reactions.

### **Background and Significance**

Plastic pollution has become a global environmental and public health crisis. Annually, over 400 million tons of plastic are produced, much of which ends up in oceans, rivers, and landfills, creating long-lasting ecological damage. Plastic is not biodegradable and breaks down into microplastics, which have been found in drinking water, food, and even the human bloodstream. Compounding this issue is the presence of toxic chemicals in plastics, which pose severe health risks.

The **Global Plastics Treaty** seeks to establish legally binding obligations for countries to tackle this problem comprehensively. The treaty aims to address the lifecycle of plastics, from production to disposal, ensuring global cooperation in reducing pollution, fostering sustainable production, and managing waste effectively.

### **The Preliminary Draft**

The draft treaty is a starting point in outlining global responsibilities for managing plastic production and pollution. It includes mechanisms to promote recycling, minimize single-use plastics, and improve waste management infrastructure. It also emphasizes the importance of global cooperation in research and innovation to find alternatives to conventional plastics.

### **Criticism from the High Ambition Coalition**

Despite its progress, the draft has faced criticism for failing to fully address the treaty’s core purpose: significantly curbing plastic production and trade and addressing the hazards of chemicals used in manufacturing plastics. A coalition of about 67 countries, including the **European Union (EU)** and the **High Ambition Coalition** (a group of Pacific Island nations and other countries), has expressed disappointment.

1. **Production Limits**: The coalition argues that the treaty’s current draft does not impose strict limits on global plastic production, which continues to grow at alarming rates. Without such restrictions, the treaty risks becoming a superficial measure that fails to address the root cause of plastic pollution.

2. **Chemical Hazards**: Plastics are manufactured using a range of chemicals, many of which are known to be harmful to human health and the environment. The draft does not adequately address the regulation or phasing out of such hazardous chemicals, leaving a critical gap in ensuring comprehensive protection.

3. **Enforcement Mechanisms**: The coalition also points out the lack of clear enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance by all nations. Without accountability, there is a risk that countries might not adhere to the treaty’s obligations, undermining its effectiveness.

### **The Way Forward**

To achieve the treaty’s full potential, the following steps are essential:
- **Stronger Commitments**: Binding commitments to limit plastic production and eliminate single-use plastics must be incorporated.
- **Chemical Regulation**: The treaty must address the lifecycle of plastics, including the harmful chemicals used in production.
- **Global Cooperation**: Developing nations require financial and technical support to transition to sustainable plastic alternatives.
- **Monitoring and Enforcement**: Robust mechanisms to track progress and enforce compliance are crucial.

### **Conclusion**

The preliminary draft of the Global Plastics Treaty is a promising start but needs substantial enhancements to align with the treaty's ambitious goals. For the treaty to make a meaningful impact, global leaders must address production limits, chemical hazards, and accountability mechanisms. As negotiations continue, there is hope that international cooperation will result in a comprehensive and enforceable treaty that effectively combats plastic pollution and protects the environment for future generations.

> The preliminary draft of the Global Plastics Treaty, developed at UN-led negotiations in Busan, South Korea, aims to address plastic pollution by promoting recycling, limiting single-use plastics, and improving waste management. However, 67 countries, including the EU and the High Ambition Coalition, have criticized it for falling short of its core purpose: curbing plastic production, regulating hazardous chemicals, and enforcing compliance. The coalition urges stronger commitments to limit production, phase out toxic chemicals, and ensure global accountability. While a step forward, the treaty needs significant improvements to effectively combat plastic pollution and its environmental and health impacts.

# yclone Fengal to cross the coast close to Puducherry this afternoon

### **What is a Cyclone?**

A **cyclone** is a large-scale air mass that rotates around a strong center of low atmospheric pressure. Cyclones are classified based on their wind speed and the region where they occur. They typically form over warm ocean waters in tropical and subtropical regions.

#### **Types of Cyclones**
1. **Tropical Cyclones**:
   - Form over warm tropical oceans.
   - Characterized by high winds, heavy rain, and storm surges.
   - Examples: Cyclone Amphan, Cyclone Fani.
   
2. **Extratropical Cyclones**:
   - Form in mid and high latitudes.
   - Associated with cold and warm air masses interacting.

3. **Polar Cyclones**:
   - Form over the polar regions.

#### **Stages of Cyclone Formation**
1. **Formation and Development**:
   - Warm ocean waters (>26°C) fuel evaporation and cloud formation.
   - A low-pressure area develops, pulling in surrounding moist air.

2. **Maturation**:
   - The system organizes into a spiral, with winds circulating around the low-pressure center (the eye of the cyclone).
   - The eye is calm, while the eyewall has the highest wind speeds and intense rainfall.

3. **Dissipation**:
   - Cyclones weaken when they move over cooler waters or land, losing their energy source.

---

### **Naming of Cyclones**

The naming of cyclones is a systematic process managed by regional meteorological bodies under the guidance of the **World Meteorological Organization (WMO)**. Cyclone names make communication about storms easier and reduce confusion when multiple systems are active.

#### **How Are Cyclones Named?**
1. **Regional Committees**:
   - The world is divided into regions managed by specialized meteorological bodies, such as:
     - **IMD (India Meteorological Department)**: Manages naming for the North Indian Ocean, including the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea.
     - **NOAA**: Manages naming for the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific.

2. **Pre-decided Lists**:
   - Each region maintains a list of names contributed by its member countries.
   - For example, countries in the North Indian Ocean region (India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, etc.) submit names, which are used sequentially.

3. **Characteristics of Names**:
   - Names must be simple, distinctive, and culturally sensitive.
   - They are gender-neutral and avoid religious or politically sensitive references.

---

### **Cyclone Naming System in the Indian Ocean**

For the North Indian Ocean region, including the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, the naming process follows these guidelines:
1. **Member Contributions**:
   - Countries submit lists of names. For example:
     - India: Agni, Akash, Bijli.
     - Bangladesh: Fani, Bulbul.
     - Oman: Gonu, Luban.

2. **Sequential Usage**:
   - Names are used in the order of submission and cannot be reused once they have been used for a significant cyclone.

3. **Recent Example**:
   - The current cyclone, **Cyclone Fengal**, would be named based on the sequential list maintained by the IMD, contributed by a member country.

---

### **Benefits of Naming Cyclones**
1. **Improved Communication**:
   - Helps the public and officials quickly understand the threat and refer to the storm unambiguously.

2. **Awareness and Preparedness**:
   - Names are easier to remember than technical numbers or codes, helping people respond better.

3. **Avoids Confusion**:
   - Unique names prevent confusion when multiple cyclones are active.

---

### **Conclusion**
Cyclones like **Fengal** are named following a systematic and internationally agreed process to ensure clarity and efficiency in disaster communication. This organized system, coupled with advancements in meteorological science, helps in early warning dissemination, preparation, and saving lives during natural disasters.

> A cyclone is a large-scale air mass rotating around a low-pressure center, classified as tropical, extratropical, or polar based on its formation region. Cyclones form over warm ocean waters and can cause heavy rainfall, high winds, and storm surges. Naming cyclones simplifies communication and avoids confusion during multiple active systems. The naming process is managed by regional meteorological bodies, such as the **India Meteorological Department (IMD)** for the North Indian Ocean. Member countries contribute lists of culturally sensitive, gender-neutral names used sequentially. This system enhances public awareness, preparedness, and efficient disaster communication, helping mitigate cyclone impacts.

# Indians need to share contraceptive responsibility

In 1952, India pioneered a **national programme for family planning**, whose focus has since changed — from improving maternal and child health to stabilising the population. As this programme evolved, so too did permanent methods of contraception.

During 1966-70, about 80.5% of all sterilisation procedures in India were vasectomies. This percentage declined every year due to changing policies that, together with other factors, placed less and less of an emphasis on vasectomies. The five rounds of the **National Family Health Survey (NHFS)** also show the use of male sterilisation, especially in the last three decades, to be steadily decreasing in all States. In fact, the vasectomies percentage remained constant at around 0.3% in NFHS-4 (2015-16) and NFHS-5.

### Gender and the disparity

This trend goes against Section 4.8 of the National Health Policy 2017, which aimed to increase the fraction of male sterilisations to at least 30%. Even today, India is far from meeting this target. Official data also show a large disparity between the rates of **female and male sterilisation — 37.9% and 0.3%,** respectively. Such huge differences indicate that women continue to bear virtually all of the burden of sterilisation, which in turn poses a challenge for India to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 5 — ‘gender equality and empowerment of all women and girls by 2030’ — among others.

In one attempt to bridge this gap, the world observes Vasectomy Day on the third Friday of November (it was on November 15 this year). In 2017, India observed a ‘vasectomy fortnight’ as well.

The initiative is to revitalise the procedure by increasing awareness, generating demand among men, and debunking misconceptions. In the end, the goal is for people already looking for contraceptives as well as those who would if they knew about safe options to consider vasectomies more favourably.

But for these concerted efforts, policies still overlook multiple issues on the ground, keeping them ineffective and allowing the gap between male and female sterilisation rates to persist.

### The ground reality, solutions

For example, two of the three writers of this article surveyed a village in Chhatrapati Sambhaji Nagar, Maharashtra, in March 2024 as part of a field exercise. The women said sterilisation was their responsibility and that the men do not believe they need to have vasectomies. Most of them also expressed a belief that men should not be “burdened” by it because they already work hard to make ends meet, and that undergoing the procedure could rob the men of their day’s wages, worsening their hardship.

These women were also unaware of the Indian government’s cash incentives to those who undergo vasectomies to offset the loss of wages. In fact, many studies in India have suggested that illiteracy, male egos, misconceptions about its impact on libido, and family opposition have led to the poor acceptance of vasectomies. Many men are not aware of their role in ensuring the safe passage of reproductive years in the lives of their female partners.

The unavailability of skilled providers has aggravated the situation, especially in rural areas. To make matters worse, many trained community health workers themselves know little about no-scalpel vasectomies.

As things stand, with increasing awareness of gender equality and rights, it is certainly possible to build a society in which male sterilisation is accepted as normative through proper and timely course correction.

As a **first step**, sensitisation should begin during early adolescence in schools, where awareness programmes and monitored peer-group discussions can lay the foundation for accepting sterilisation as a shared responsibility. Sustained social and behaviour change communication initiatives will be instrumental in debunking myths around and destigmatising vasectomies. Vasectomy is a safe and simple procedure compared to tubectomy, the corresponding surgical procedure for women involving their fallopian tubes.

**Second**, these information, education and communication activities should be supplemented with greater conditional cash incentives for vasectomies with the goal to improve male participation.

A study in Maharashtra in 2019 showed that more men in rural tribal areas opted for vasectomies after being offered a conditional cash incentive. Madhya Pradesh’s move in 2022 to increase this incentive by 50% is appreciable in this light.

### An international comparison

**Third**, India should draw from the lessons from other countries that have increased vasectomy uptake. South Korea has the highest prevalence of the procedure worldwide, and has reported that men are more likely to shoulder contraceptive responsibilities as a result of progressive societal norms and greater gender equality. Similarly, Bhutan has popularised vasectomy among its men by making the procedure socially acceptable, availing good-quality services, and organising government-run vasectomy camps. Brazil increased vasectomy uptake by running awareness campaigns on mass media. The prevalence rate has risen, from 0.8% in the 1980s to 5% in the last decade.

Greater public awareness of vasectomies allows both partners in a union to make informed family planning decisions. In tandem, the government must strengthen the national health system to align with policy objectives, invest in training more health professionals to perform the procedure, and promote technical advancements to increase the use of non-scalpel vasectomies.

The resulting policy should not have only intention. It should also lay out concrete steps to achieve its targets. The need of the hour is demand- and service-focused efforts rather than mere formulation.

> Contraceptive responsibility in India remains disproportionately placed on women, with limited involvement from men. While female-centric methods like sterilization dominate family planning, male participation through options like condoms or vasectomy is minimal due to social stigma, lack of awareness, and entrenched gender norms. This imbalance burdens women with the physical, emotional, and financial costs of contraception. Encouraging men to share responsibility requires comprehensive sex education, widespread awareness campaigns, and destigmatization of male contraceptive methods. A balanced approach to contraceptive responsibility not only promotes gender equality but also ensures better reproductive health outcomes for both partners, strengthening family welfare.

# ONOS bitten

The **One Nation, One Subscription (ONOS)** plan is a transformative initiative aimed at democratizing access to scholarly research in India. Approved by the Union Cabinet on November 25, 2024, ONOS seeks to address the significant barrier posed by high subscription fees charged by academic journals, enabling equitable access to research for scholars and the public alike.

### **Background and Problem**
Access to scholarly research has long been dominated by expensive subscription models. Academic journals typically charge fees for both publishing and accessing research papers, creating a dual-revenue stream. While researchers often have to pay publication fees, those who wish to read these papers must also pay subscription or individual access fees. Research institutes, particularly universities and colleges, mitigate this barrier by subscribing to journal bundles, granting their scholars access through library resources.

However, over time, the fees charged by journals have escalated significantly, outpacing the financial capacity of many research institutions, especially underfunded government institutes. In response, academic librarians formed **consortia**, pooling resources and bargaining collectively to negotiate better terms with publishers. While consortia brought some relief, the fundamental issue of steep costs and limited access remained, leaving smaller institutions and independent researchers at a disadvantage.

### **The ONOS Initiative**
ONOS was first proposed in India’s **fifth draft National Science, Technology, and Innovation Policy (2020)** to address these challenges. The plan replaces the decentralized consortia model with a centralized system led by the national government. Instead of multiple institutions negotiating separate deals with publishers, the government acts as a single buyer, negotiating a unified subscription fee with academic journals. This allows the government to leverage its substantial bargaining power to secure access to journals at a significantly lower cost.

### **Key Features and Benefits**
1. **Universal Access**:
   - ONOS ensures that all government-funded research institutes, universities, and even smaller colleges have access to expensive journals.
   - It levels the playing field by removing disparities between well-funded and underfunded institutions.

2. **Cost Efficiency**:
   - Centralized negotiations under ONOS reduce duplication of costs across institutions, optimizing the allocation of public funds.
   - Publishers will now deal with one entity, simplifying negotiations and administrative processes.

3. **Empowering Researchers**:
   - Scholars across the country, regardless of their affiliation or institutional resources, can access global research outputs without financial barriers.
   - This boosts research productivity and fosters innovation.

4. **Public Access**:
   - ONOS aligns with open science principles, potentially providing the general public with access to valuable scientific knowledge.

### **Challenges and Criticisms**
While ONOS is a promising reform, it is not without challenges:
- **Budgetary Constraints**: The national government must allocate substantial resources upfront to cover subscription costs for all institutions.
- **Publisher Pushback**: Some publishers may resist lower negotiated fees, potentially leading to prolonged negotiations or restricted access to specific journals.
- **Implementation Complexity**: Coordinating with diverse institutions and ensuring seamless access will require robust infrastructure and administrative oversight.

### **Impact on the Research Ecosystem**
ONOS has the potential to significantly enhance India’s research ecosystem:
- It democratizes access to knowledge, empowering researchers from Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities.
- Increased access may lead to higher-quality research output, aiding India’s global scientific standing.
- It reduces dependency on foreign funding by enabling indigenous research capacity.

### **Conclusion**
The ONOS plan is a bold step towards making research universally accessible in India. By centralizing subscriptions and reducing costs, ONOS addresses inequities in access to academic resources, fostering a more inclusive and collaborative research environment. While challenges remain, its successful implementation could serve as a model for other countries grappling with similar issues, advancing the global movement for open science and equitable knowledge sharing.

> The **One Nation, One Subscription (ONOS)** plan, approved by India’s Union Cabinet, aims to democratize access to academic research by replacing institutional consortia with a centralized subscription system managed by the government. ONOS addresses the high costs of journal subscriptions, enabling underfunded institutions and scholars to access expensive research resources. It promotes universal access, cost efficiency, and equity in the research ecosystem, empowering researchers across the country. However, challenges include budgetary demands, publisher resistance, and implementation complexities. If successful, ONOS could boost India’s research productivity, reduce disparities, and serve as a global model for equitable access to scientific knowledge.
