# After climate talks, nations gather to iron out a treaty to curb plastics

The upcoming **fifth round of discussions** of the **Intergovernmental Negotiations Committee (INC)** on **December 1** in **Busan, South Korea**, is a critical juncture in the global effort to address the plastic crisis. Representatives from **175 countries** aim to finalize a legally binding international treaty to tackle plastic pollution, building on the outcomes of previous meetings held in **Punte Del Este (Uruguay), Paris (France), Nairobi (Kenya), and Ottawa (Canada)**. This round of negotiations is widely anticipated to be the final step toward drafting an actionable framework for eliminating plastic waste and promoting sustainable practices.

### Background and Objectives
Plastic pollution is one of the most pressing environmental challenges, with nearly **11 million tons** of plastic entering oceans annually. By 2040, this figure could triple without significant intervention. Plastic’s persistence in ecosystems, its impact on marine and terrestrial life, and its contribution to microplastic contamination demand urgent global action. Recognizing this, the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA) initiated the INC process in **2022**, aiming to create a comprehensive treaty to address all stages of the plastic lifecycle—from production to disposal.

The treaty seeks to:
- **Reduce Plastic Production**: Limit the production of single-use plastics and promote alternative materials.
- **Encourage Recycling and Waste Management**: Develop global standards for waste management and recycling infrastructure.
- **Regulate Microplastics**: Address the rising concern of microplastic contamination in water, soil, and the food chain.
- **Support Developing Nations**: Provide financial and technological assistance to low-income countries to manage plastic pollution effectively.

### The Role of Busan Negotiations
The **Busan negotiations** are crucial as they aim to finalize the draft text of the treaty. Key aspects under consideration include:
1. **Legally Binding Targets**: Setting clear, enforceable targets for plastic reduction and management.
2. **Global Collaboration**: Establishing mechanisms for knowledge-sharing, capacity-building, and financial support among nations.
3. **Monitoring and Accountability**: Creating systems to track progress, ensure compliance, and penalize non-compliance.
4. **Flexibility for Developing Nations**: Allowing transitional periods and providing support for nations with limited resources.

If the negotiations succeed, the draft treaty will be adopted at a **convention next year**, where Ministers from signatory nations will formally ratify the agreement. This will lay the foundation for periodic meetings, similar to the **annual climate Conference of Parties (CoP)**, to review progress, update targets, and address emerging challenges.

### Challenges to Agreement
Reaching consensus among 175 countries is no small task. Key challenges include:
- **Diverging National Interests**: Major plastic-producing countries and industries may resist strict measures, citing economic impacts.
- **Financing and Equity**: Developing nations seek assurances of financial and technical support to implement treaty provisions.
- **Scope and Ambition**: Disagreements persist over whether the treaty should emphasize recycling and waste management or focus on curbing production.

### Implications of a Successful Treaty
A legally binding treaty on plastic pollution would be a historic achievement, comparable to the **Paris Agreement** on climate change. It could:
- **Transform Industries**: Push industries to innovate in sustainable materials and packaging.
- **Reduce Pollution**: Significantly cut plastic waste entering ecosystems, protecting biodiversity and public health.
- **Foster Global Collaboration**: Create a unified approach to addressing plastic pollution, aligning nations toward a common goal.

### Conclusion
The Busan negotiations represent a pivotal moment in the fight against plastic pollution. A successful outcome would set the stage for a landmark treaty, uniting nations in their commitment to phasing out harmful plastics and adopting sustainable practices. However, the road to consensus requires balancing ambition with equity and ensuring that all nations, regardless of economic standing, can contribute to and benefit from this global effort.

> The **fifth round of Intergovernmental Negotiations Committee (INC)** talks on December 1 in **Busan, South Korea**, aims to finalize a legally binding global treaty to combat plastic pollution. Building on previous discussions, the treaty seeks to reduce plastic production, promote recycling, address microplastics, and support developing nations. Key challenges include balancing ambitious targets with financial and technical support for poorer nations and managing divergent national interests. If successful, the treaty will be adopted next year, with periodic reviews akin to climate **Conference of Parties (CoP)**. This agreement could significantly reduce plastic waste, foster innovation, and unify global efforts against plastic pollution.

### Explanation of the Words **Secular** and **Socialist** in the Indian Constitution

The words **‘Secular’** and **‘Socialist’** were inserted into the **Preamble** of the Indian Constitution through the **42nd Constitution Amendment Act, 1976**, during the Emergency period under the leadership of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. These terms reflect the foundational principles of the Indian state, emphasizing equality, justice, and the absence of discrimination based on religion or economic status. Below is a detailed explanation of each term and their significance within the framework of the Indian Constitution.

---

### 1. **Secular**
- **Definition in Context**: 
  The word **‘Secular’** denotes that India is a Republic that upholds equal respect and recognition for all religions. It ensures the **separation of religion from the State**, safeguarding the freedom of individuals to practice, propagate, or not adhere to any religion.

- **Constitutional Basis**:
  - **Article 25-28**: These articles guarantee the **right to freedom of religion**, allowing citizens to freely practice and propagate their beliefs without state interference.

  - Overemphasis on socialism has sometimes led to inefficiencies in public sector undertakings and hindered private sector growth.

---

### 3. **Inclusion through the 42nd Amendment**
- **Why Added**: 
  - To reflect the socio-political ideology of the time, emphasizing **equality and justice** amidst a period of economic and social unrest.
  - To signal India’s commitment to **social welfare** and religious neutrality, especially during the Emergency, when state control over various aspects of public life was heightened.

- **Legal Challenges**:
  - The inclusion of these terms was challenged in 2020 on grounds that they were not part of the **original Constitution**, and their retrospective application violated the intent of the **Constituent Assembly**.
  - The **Supreme Court of India** dismissed these arguments, stating that the terms reflect **existing principles** already embedded in the Constitution through Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles.

---

### 4. **SC's Observations on Secularism and Socialism**
- The **Supreme Court** recently reiterated that:
  - **‘Secular’** denotes equal respect for all religions, reaffirming that India is not a theocratic state but one where all religions are treated equally.
  - **‘Socialist’** reflects India’s commitment to eliminating exploitation in all forms—be it economic, political, or social.
- The Court emphasized that the **Preamble is an inalienable part** of the Constitution, and Parliament has the power to amend it under **Article 368**, as long as it adheres to the **basic structure doctrine**.

---

### Conclusion
The inclusion of **‘Secular’** and **‘Socialist’** in the Preamble reinforces India’s foundational principles of equality, justice, and inclusivity. While the words themselves were added in 1976, the underlying concepts were deeply rooted in the Constitution’s **Fundamental Rights**, **Directive Principles**, and the vision of the Constituent Assembly. These terms continue to serve as guiding principles for governance in India, promoting harmony and welfare in a diverse and dynamic society.

# Return to action

The recent climate negotiations at **COP29** in **Baku** concluded after two extra nights of intense discussions with an agreement that, while officially hailed as progress, left many developing nations frustrated. The final **“roadmap”** includes a commitment to triple public climate finance for developing countries, raising the goal from $100 billion annually to **$300 billion by 2035**. Additionally, countries pledged to mobilize a total of **$1.3 trillion per year** by 2035 from both public and private sources. However, these commitments fall significantly short of what many countries, particularly in the Global South, had demanded, raising concerns about the efficacy of these pledges in addressing the escalating climate crisis.

### The Context of Negotiations
Countries attending the conference brought ambitious demands to the table, reflecting the urgent need for decisive action to combat climate change. Developing nations sought substantial financial commitments, particularly in public finance, to support climate mitigation and adaptation measures. They also emphasized the need for mechanisms that could facilitate **affordable technology transfer** and support vulnerable populations in building **resilient infrastructure**. Despite these pressing needs, the final agreement reflects a scaled-back version of these demands, underscoring the inherent tensions and inequalities in international climate negotiations.

### Key Outcomes
1. **Financial Commitments**:
   - The agreement includes a commitment to **triple public finance** for developing nations, raising the goal to **$300 billion per year by 2035**. While significant, this amount is only 20% of the original demand made by developing countries.
   - A broader goal of scaling up finance to **$1.3 trillion annually** from both public and private sources by 2035 was also pledged.

2. **Gaps and Limitations**:
   - The $300 billion figure, though substantial, lacks accompanying provisions to ensure its effective use. For instance, there are no mechanisms to prioritize **public finance**, which is essential for affordable and equitable climate action.
   - The absence of frameworks to support **technology transfer** and **infrastructure investments** in vulnerable regions limits the potential impact of these funds.
   - The reliance on private finance raises concerns about affordability, as private investments often come with conditions that can increase the financial burden on developing countries.

### Reactions and Criticism
- **Developing Countries’ Frustration**: Many nations in the Global South have expressed disappointment, arguing that the roadmap fails to address their most urgent needs. They had pushed for greater public finance commitments and mechanisms to ensure the fair distribution of funds, particularly for adaptation projects in regions most affected by climate change.
- **Developed Nations’ Relief**: Developed countries, on the other hand, view the agreement as a balanced outcome. By committing to a mix of public and private financing, they have avoided placing undue strain on their national budgets while meeting their obligations under international climate agreements.
- **Lack of Transformative Measures**: Critics argue that the roadmap lacks transformative measures to significantly alter the current trajectory of global warming. The absence of specific provisions for equitable finance distribution and technological support limits the agreement’s ability to catalyze meaningful climate action.

### The Broader Implications
While $300 billion annually by 2035 is a substantial increase in public climate finance, its effectiveness hinges on how these funds are mobilized and allocated. Public finance is crucial for projects that prioritize equity and accessibility, such as building climate-resilient infrastructure, supporting vulnerable communities, and fostering clean energy transitions in developing countries. Without clear frameworks for these priorities, the pledged funds may not fully address the disparities between developed and developing nations in their ability to combat climate change.

Moreover, the reliance on private finance to meet the $1.3 trillion target raises concerns about the affordability and accessibility of such investments. Private investors typically prioritize returns, which could lead to higher costs for recipient nations and limit the scope of investments in adaptation and social welfare projects.

### Conclusion
The COP29 agreement reflects progress but highlights the persistent gap between the demands of developing nations and the willingness of developed countries to meet those demands. While the financial commitments are noteworthy, the lack of provisions for public finance prioritization, technology transfer, and equity-focused investments weakens their potential impact. Moving forward, addressing these gaps will be critical to ensuring that the pledged funds contribute effectively to mitigating climate change and supporting the most vulnerable populations. Without more transformative action, the planet remains on a perilous path, with disproportionate burdens falling on the Global South.

> The **COP29** negotiations in **Baku** concluded with a roadmap pledging to triple public climate finance for developing countries to **$300 billion annually by 2035** and mobilize **$1.3 trillion annually** from public and private sources. However, developing nations were left frustrated as the commitments fell short of their demands, representing only 20% of what was sought. The absence of mechanisms for prioritizing **public finance**, supporting **technology transfer**, or funding **infrastructure for vulnerable populations** limited the agreement’s potential. Critics argue the reliance on private finance raises equity concerns, leaving the planet on a perilous path and the Global South bearing disproportionate burdens.

# The Constitution still thrives, let it show India the way essay

**The Constitution Still Thrives: Let It Show India the Way**

The **Constitution of India**, adopted on **November 26, 1949**, is a living document that continues to shape and guide the world’s largest democracy. Its resilience over seven decades is a testament to the visionary foresight of the framers and its capacity to adapt to the changing needs of society. Amid the challenges of social, economic, and political turbulence, the Constitution remains a symbol of hope, justice, and unity, showing the path toward an equitable and inclusive future.

### 1. **The Constitution as a Guiding Light**
The Indian Constitution is much more than a legal framework; it embodies the ideals and aspirations of a diverse nation. Anchored in the principles of **justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity**, it reflects a deep commitment to democracy, secularism, and social justice. The Preamble, often called the “soul” of the Constitution, declares India to be a **sovereign, socialist, secular, and democratic republic**, providing a blueprint for its governance and progress.

Despite the challenges of time, the Constitution has shown remarkable adaptability. Amendments, such as the inclusion of the **Right to Education** and **reservations for economically weaker sections**, illustrate its ability to address evolving societal needs while preserving its core values.

---

### 2. **Challenges to Constitutional Ideals**
While the Constitution thrives, its principles are often tested by political, social, and economic challenges:
- **Polarization and Division**: Increasing communal tensions and identity politics threaten the secular fabric of the nation. The Constitution’s commitment to **equal respect for all religions** must remain a guiding principle to foster unity in diversity.
- **Inequality and Poverty**: Economic disparity continues to widen, contradicting the socialist vision of reducing exploitation and ensuring equitable distribution of wealth. Strengthening welfare policies rooted in **Directive Principles of State Policy** is essential to bridge this gap.
- **Erosion of Democratic Values**: Misuse of state machinery, attacks on freedom of speech, and suppression of dissent undermine the Constitution’s democratic ethos. Upholding **fundamental rights** and ensuring accountability is vital for preserving democracy.
- **Judicial Independence**: Ensuring an impartial judiciary remains critical for upholding constitutional values, especially as executive overreach can pose a threat to checks and balances.

---

### 3. **The Constitution as a Dynamic Force**

---

### 4. **How the Constitution Shows the Way Forward**
The Constitution provides a roadmap for India’s progress. Its emphasis on **democratic governance**, **social justice**, and **human rights** can address the nation’s challenges if implemented in letter and spirit:
- **Empowering Citizens**: Promoting awareness of constitutional rights and duties can strengthen democratic participation and accountability.
- **Strengthening Institutions**: Independent institutions like the **Election Commission**, **Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG)**, and **judiciary** are pillars of constitutional democracy. Safeguarding their autonomy ensures fairness and transparency.
- **Education and Equality**: Universal access to education, health, and economic opportunities aligns with the Constitution’s vision of social and economic justice.
- **Sustainable Development**: Articles related to environmental protection, such as **Article 48-A** and **Article 51-A(g)**, emphasize the need for policies that balance development with ecological sustainability.

---

### 5. **A People’s Constitution**
The Constitution thrives not just because of its text but due to the people who uphold it. Civil society, media, and an engaged citizenry play critical roles in ensuring that constitutional values remain alive. Movements for **women’s rights**, **LGBTQ+ equality**, and **freedom of expression** reflect the collective effort to make the Constitution a lived reality.

The Constitution’s ability to withstand the pressures of time and remain relevant stems from its deep connection to India’s pluralistic ethos. It serves as a constant reminder that the strength of a democracy lies in the protection of individual rights and collective responsibilities.

---

### 6. **Conclusion**
The Indian Constitution continues to thrive as a beacon of hope, showing the nation the way forward in an era of complexities and challenges. Its enduring principles provide a robust foundation for democracy, justice, and inclusivity. As India progresses, the Constitution must remain the guiding force, reminding us that unity in diversity, respect for rights, and adherence to justice are the keys to building a strong and equitable society. By committing to its ideals and ensuring their implementation, India can confidently navigate the path to a prosperous and harmonious future.

> The **Indian Constitution**, adopted in 1949, remains a resilient and adaptable framework guiding the nation’s progress. Anchored in **justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity**, it upholds democracy, secularism, and social justice. Despite challenges like communal tensions, economic inequality, and democratic erosion, its adaptability ensures relevance through amendments and judicial safeguards like the **basic structure doctrine**. By empowering citizens, strengthening institutions, and promoting sustainable development, the Constitution provides a roadmap for inclusive growth.

Stubble burning, the practice of setting fire to agricultural residue left after harvesting, is a significant contributor to air pollution in many regions of India, particularly in **Punjab, Haryana**, and **Uttar Pradesh**. Farmers often resort to burning crop residue, primarily rice stubble, due to time constraints and lack of affordable alternatives before the sowing of the next crop. This seasonal activity exacerbates air pollution, leading to severe health and environmental issues, especially in the National Capital Region (NCR). Recent advancements in **satellite data** have emerged as a critical tool in monitoring and mitigating the impacts of stubble burning.

### **1. The Impact of Stubble Burning**
Stubble burning has far-reaching consequences, including:
- **Air Pollution**: The burning of crop residue releases **particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10)**, **carbon dioxide (CO2)**, **methane (CH4)**, and other harmful gases, significantly degrading air quality.
- **Health Risks**: Prolonged exposure to pollutants causes respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular diseases, and exacerbates pre-existing conditions like asthma, particularly among vulnerable populations.
- **Environmental Damage**: Stubble burning depletes soil nutrients, reduces soil fertility, and contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, intensifying climate change.
- **Economic Costs**: The pollution necessitates healthcare expenditures and productivity losses while imposing clean-up costs on governments.

### **2. Role of Satellite Data in Monitoring Stubble Burning**
**Satellite data** has revolutionized the way stubble burning is monitored, offering real-time, accurate, and large-scale insights into the phenomenon. Key contributions of satellite data include:

- **Detection and Mapping**:
  - Satellites equipped with thermal imaging and infrared sensors, like those in the **Sentinel-2**, **MODIS**, and **Landsat** programs, detect active fires and pinpoint stubble burning locations.
  - **NASA’s VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite)** and ISRO’s remote sensing satellites track fire occurrences and their intensity.

- **Quantifying Air Pollution**:
  - Satellite sensors measure pollutant concentrations, such as PM2.5 and NO2, in affected regions.
  - Atmospheric monitoring systems like **Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS)** use satellite data to model the dispersion of pollutants.

- **Early Warnings and Policy Interventions**:
  - Real-time satellite data enables authorities to issue early warnings, enforce bans, and deploy resources to prevent or manage fires.
  - Data sharing between agencies facilitates collaborative decision-making to curb stubble burning.

- **Public Awareness and Accountability**:
  - Satellite maps showing fire locations and pollution levels raise public awareness, prompting collective action and holding stakeholders accountable.

### **3. Challenges in Using Satellite Data**
While satellite technology is invaluable, its application faces challenges:
- **Resolution Limitations**: Low-resolution satellite imagery may miss smaller fires or inaccurately attribute fire locations.
- **Data Accessibility**: Not all stakeholders have the expertise or resources to access and interpret satellite data effectively.
- **On-Ground Action**: Despite precise data, enforcement and incentivization for alternatives often lag behind, limiting the impact of monitoring efforts.

### **4. Solutions and Alternatives to Stubble Burning**
To address stubble burning effectively, a combination of technological, policy-driven, and socio-economic measures is needed:
- **Promoting Alternatives**: Mechanized solutions like **Happy Seeders** (machines that plant seeds without requiring stubble removal) and **biodegradable decomposers** can reduce dependency on burning.
- **Incentivizing Farmers**: Providing subsidies for machinery and financial support for residue management can encourage farmers to adopt eco-friendly practices.
- **Awareness Campaigns**: Educating farmers about the long-term environmental and health impacts of stubble burning is essential.
- **Strengthening Policy Enforcement**: Using satellite data to monitor violations can enhance the implementation of laws against stubble burning.

### **5. Future Prospects**
Advancements in satellite technology and data analytics hold immense potential for addressing stubble burning. Integrating satellite data with **machine learning models** and **IoT devices** can provide even more precise forecasts and actionable insights. Collaborative efforts between government agencies, research institutions, and the private sector can further enhance the utility of satellite-based monitoring.

### **Conclusion**
Stubble burning remains a critical challenge, with severe consequences for public health and the environment. Satellite data has emerged as a powerful tool for monitoring and mitigating its impacts by offering real-time insights and enabling targeted interventions. However, the success of these efforts depends on the effective implementation of policies, promotion of sustainable alternatives, and collaboration between stakeholders. By leveraging technology and fostering community-driven solutions, India can address stubble burning and move toward a cleaner, healthier future.
