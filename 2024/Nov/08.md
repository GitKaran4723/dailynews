# Inspection exposes flaws in egg distribution scheme in schools in Karnataka

A recent inspection aimed at evaluating the implementation of the newly launched egg distribution scheme in government and aided schools revealed notable non-compliance. Despite the program's goal to provide eggs to students for nutritional benefits, many schools have failed to do so even when students requested eggs. The inspection, which covered 357 randomly selected schools across the state, found that 66 schools (around 20%) did not adhere to the scheme’s guidelines. Instead of eggs, students were provided with alternatives like chikkis or bananas.

The Department of School Education and Literacy (DSEL) has taken corrective measures by issuing notices to these non-compliant schools and holding 98 officials responsible for the lapse. Among those held accountable are 50 Block Education Officers (BEOs) and 48 Assistant Directors of the PM-Poshan Scheme, emphasizing the seriousness of the oversight. This response underlines the government's commitment to ensuring that the scheme’s objectives are met and that administrative lapses do not undermine its impact.

### Details of the Scheme

The egg distribution scheme, launched on September 25, was created in collaboration with the Azim Premji Foundation (APF) as part of the government’s efforts to address malnutrition, anaemia, and nutrient deficiencies among schoolchildren. Under the scheme, students in all government and aided schools are provided with eggs six days a week. For children who do not consume eggs due to dietary preferences or religious beliefs, bananas and chikkis are offered as alternatives. The program aims to enhance the physical health and development of children, ensuring they receive the necessary nutrients to support growth and cognitive function.

### The Importance of the Scheme

India has long faced challenges related to child malnutrition, with a significant percentage of children experiencing stunted growth, anaemia, and other nutrient-related deficiencies. Nutrient-dense foods such as eggs play a crucial role in combating these issues, as they are rich in protein, vitamins, and essential minerals. The scheme’s focus on distributing eggs aims to fill the nutritional gaps in children’s diets, contributing to better health outcomes and improved academic performance.

By implementing this program, the government aims to support the physical development of students, reduce rates of malnutrition, and create an environment conducive to learning. Eggs are a cost-effective and highly nutritious option, making them an ideal choice for a large-scale school feeding initiative.

### Issues and Challenges

The inspection’s findings highlight several challenges in the scheme’s implementation. The non-compliance reported in 20% of inspected schools points to potential issues such as logistical hurdles, supply chain disruptions, administrative oversight, or reluctance on the part of school authorities to adhere to guidelines. While bananas and chikkis are viable alternatives, their nutrient profile does not match that of eggs, potentially limiting the scheme’s intended impact.

Accountability has become a key focus in addressing these challenges. By issuing notices and holding officials responsible, the DSEL aims to reinforce adherence to the scheme and ensure that such lapses are not repeated. However, continuous monitoring and a robust support system are essential for the successful long-term implementation of the scheme. Training sessions for school administrators and better supply chain management could help mitigate these issues.

### Conclusion

The egg distribution scheme launched in government and aided schools is an important initiative aimed at combating malnutrition and promoting healthy growth among students. The recent inspection, which exposed non-compliance in 20% of schools, has prompted action by the DSEL to ensure that guidelines are followed more rigorously. By holding officials accountable and addressing challenges in implementation, the government is taking steps to make the scheme more effective. Continued oversight, better logistics, and enhanced training for school staff are vital for the scheme to meet its objectives and benefit the intended student population.

> An inspection of the recently launched egg distribution scheme in government and aided schools revealed significant non-compliance, with 66 out of 357 schools (about 20%) not adhering to the program.

# Beyond AI: City’s traffic needs smart management, signal synchronisation

Improving city traffic systems requires a multifaceted approach that goes beyond simple infrastructure changes. While AI and technology play key roles, global examples show that successful traffic management systems integrate smart management, real-time data, and innovative policies. Here are some strategies and global examples that can inspire better traffic management:

### 1. **Adaptive Traffic Signal Control**
   - **Example**: **Los Angeles, USA**: The city has implemented an advanced adaptive traffic control system that uses sensors and real-time data to adjust signal timing based on traffic flow. This system, known as ATSAC (Automated Traffic Surveillance and Control), synchronizes traffic signals to optimize the flow of vehicles, reducing congestion and travel time.
   - **Application**: Implementing adaptive signal systems in major intersections of cities can lead to smoother traffic flow and reduced waiting times.

### 2. **Integrated Traffic Management Systems (ITMS)**
   - **Example**: **Singapore**: Singapore’s Land Transport Authority (LTA) uses an ITMS that integrates various data sources, such as GPS from taxis and public transportation, to monitor and manage traffic. The system provides real-time traffic information to drivers and dynamically adjusts traffic lights and signs.
   - **Application**: Cities can adopt similar ITMS that combine data from CCTV cameras, sensors, and public transit to improve response times and manage traffic in real-time.

### 3. **Public Transportation Upgrades and Integration**
   - **Example**: **Curitiba, Brazil**: Curitiba is known for its innovative Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system, which operates like a subway but on dedicated road lanes. The integration of public transport with traffic management has reduced congestion and made commuting more efficient.
   - **Application**: Enhancing public transportation and integrating it with traffic management can reduce private vehicle usage and ease congestion.

### 4. **Signal Synchronization (Green Wave)**
   - **Example**: **Copenhagen, Denmark**: The city implemented a “green wave” system where traffic lights are synchronized to allow cyclists and vehicles to pass through multiple intersections without stopping if they maintain a certain speed. This reduces stop-and-go traffic and encourages eco-friendly travel.
   - **Application**: Synchronizing traffic lights along major roads can improve vehicle flow, decrease fuel consumption, and minimize emissions.

### 5. **Smart Parking Solutions**
   - **Example**: **San Francisco, USA**: The city uses a smart parking system called SFpark that uses sensors and real-time data to help drivers locate available parking spaces. This reduces the time spent searching for parking, which accounts for a significant portion of urban congestion.
   - **Application**: Implementing smart parking solutions with real-time availability updates can reduce road congestion and improve traffic flow.

### 6. **Congestion Pricing**
   - **Example**: **London, UK**: The city’s congestion charge requires drivers to pay a fee to enter central areas during peak hours, reducing traffic volume and encouraging the use of public transport. This policy has successfully decreased traffic congestion and pollution levels.
   - **Application**: Implementing congestion pricing in densely populated areas can dissuade non-essential vehicle trips and promote alternative transportation options.

### 7. **Real-Time Traffic Apps and Information Dissemination**
   - **Example**: **Tokyo, Japan**: Tokyo uses real-time traffic monitoring systems that inform drivers about road conditions and alternative routes through apps and traffic signs. This dynamic management helps drivers make informed decisions and reduces bottlenecks.
   - **Application**: Developing or enhancing apps that provide real-time traffic updates, road closures, and alternative routes can help drivers avoid congestion.

### 8. **Smart Traffic Cameras and AI-Powered Analytics**
   - **Example**: **Amsterdam, Netherlands**: The city employs AI-powered cameras and sensors to monitor traffic and adjust signals accordingly. This system helps identify issues like accidents and congestion hotspots and can predict and mitigate potential traffic jams.
   - **Application**: Installing AI-based surveillance can enhance traffic flow analysis, automate signal adjustments, and improve safety by alerting authorities to incidents in real-time.

### 9. **Promoting Alternative Transportation**
   - **Example**: **Bogotá, Colombia**: The city has invested in extensive cycling infrastructure and closed certain roads to vehicles on weekends (Ciclovía). This has reduced traffic congestion and promoted sustainable travel.
   - **Application**: Creating safe, dedicated cycling lanes and pedestrian zones can encourage alternative transport and ease vehicle traffic.

### 10. **Comprehensive Traffic Education Programs**
   - **Example**: **Stockholm, Sweden**: The city’s Vision Zero initiative incorporates education programs that inform citizens about traffic rules and the importance of safe driving. This program has contributed to reduced traffic incidents and congestion.
   - **Application**: Traffic management efforts should include educating drivers and pedestrians on traffic safety and promoting courteous driving behavior.

### **Conclusion**
Improving city traffic systems requires a combination of adaptive technology, policy changes, and public education. Drawing inspiration from cities like Singapore, Copenhagen, and London can guide initiatives to create smart, efficient, and sustainable traffic management systems. Emphasizing real-time data integration, adaptive signal control, and promoting public and alternative transportation can help cities reduce congestion and enhance urban mobility.

> Improving city traffic systems requires smart management and global best practices. Examples include adaptive traffic signals in Los Angeles that adjust based on real-time data, Singapore's Integrated Traffic Management System for optimized flow, and Copenhagen's synchronized "green wave" for smoother travel. Cities like London use congestion pricing to reduce traffic, while San Francisco has smart parking solutions. Public transport upgrades, like Curitiba's Bus Rapid Transit, and real-time traffic apps in Tokyo aid traffic management. AI-powered analytics in Amsterdam enhance safety and response. Promoting cycling, as seen in Bogotá, and educational initiatives like Stockholm’s Vision Zero contribute to sustainable, safer traffic systems.

# All or any

The Constitution of India embodies an economic philosophy rooted in socialist principles, primarily reflected in the Directive Principles of State Policy. Articles 39(b) and (c) articulate the state’s obligation to ensure the equitable distribution of “material resources of the community” to subserve the common good and prevent the concentration of wealth detrimental to the public interest. A significant legal question has been the extent to which the state’s obligation to fulfill these principles can impinge upon individuals’ fundamental rights.

Recently, a nine-judge Bench of the Supreme Court ruled that not all private resources fall within the scope of “material resources” as referenced in Article 39(b). This decision is pivotal as it addresses whether this directive principle should be interpreted expansively to include any privately-owned assets as resources of the community, or if limitations should be applied. The Court’s majority opinion rejected previous judicial interpretations that suggested an expansive approach, emphasizing that such an interpretation could bring any privately-owned resource under state control. The Bench’s decision reflects a contemporary understanding of economic realities and argues that the Directive Principles should not be viewed through a fixed ideological lens.

The judgment outlined that while private resources theoretically could be considered community resources, their inclusion for state acquisition or distribution must be evaluated based on several “non-exhaustive factors.” These include the nature and characteristics of the resource, whether its acquisition is necessary for public welfare, the scarcity of the resource, and the impact of its concentration in private ownership. This view balances state intervention with individual property rights, ensuring that such actions are justified only when clearly beneficial to the community.

The ruling also aligns with the principle of eminent domain, traditionally used in land acquisition, which requires fair compensation and public purpose justification. Similarly, the allocation of natural resources must adhere to transparent processes to ensure fairness. Historically, the nationalization of industries and utilities has needed constitutional backing, typically justified by Directive Principles emphasizing the common good.

The majority opinion contends that Article 39 was intentionally drafted with broad language by the Constitution-makers to allow flexibility for future regimes without binding them to any specific economic ideology. This ensures that the principles can adapt to varying economic contexts and state needs over time. However, Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia’s dissent presents a contrasting view that emphasizes ongoing societal inequalities. He questioned the decision to limit the scope of what constitutes “material resources” and suggested that a better approach would be to trust the legislature’s discretion in applying these principles for equitable economic governance.

Justice Dhulia’s dissent underscores the persistent economic disparities within Indian society, implying that a more expansive view might empower the state to address systemic inequality more effectively. He posited that limiting the scope of Article 39 could restrict future legislative action aimed at redistributing resources for the public good.

### Conclusion

The Supreme Court’s ruling redefines the application of Article 39 by delineating the limits on state acquisition of private resources under the directive of the common good. The decision underscores that while some privately-owned resources may be deemed community assets, they must meet specific criteria for state action. This nuanced interpretation aims to respect individual property rights while balancing the state’s role in promoting public welfare. Justice Dhulia’s dissent highlights the ongoing debate about how best to address social inequality and whether legislative judgment should have more flexibility. This ruling will likely shape future legal and policy decisions related to economic rights and state intervention.

> The Supreme Court ruled that not all private resources fall under “material resources of the community” as outlined in Article 39(b) of the Indian Constitution. This decision limits state power to acquire private property for the common good unless specific criteria, such as the nature and necessity of the resource, are met. The majority opinion emphasized that Article 39 was designed with broad wording to allow flexibility without tying it to a particular economic ideology. However, Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia's dissent argued for a more expansive interpretation to address persistent societal inequalities and suggested leaving the matter to legislative discretion.

# India, Pakistan and modifying the Indus Waters Treaty

India’s decision to serve a formal notice on August 30, 2024, to review and modify the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) reflects deep-seated concerns regarding the sustainability of its water resources amidst changing domestic demands. This move is guided by Article XII (3) of the IWT, which permits revisions through mutual agreement. The treaty, originally signed in 1960 between India and Pakistan with the assistance of the World Bank, governs the allocation of the Indus River and its tributaries, splitting the control of waters between the two nations to ensure equitable distribution.

### Reasons for the Review

1. **Increased Domestic Water Needs**: India’s population growth and urban expansion have significantly heightened the demand for water. The existing provisions of the IWT, formulated more than six decades ago, may no longer adequately address the country’s current demographic and agricultural landscape. India seeks modifications to better align the treaty’s framework with the needs of its growing population and evolving agricultural requirements.

2. **Clean Energy Development**: As part of its environmental commitments and efforts to meet emission targets, India is accelerating the development of clean energy sources, including hydropower. The current treaty’s restrictions limit the scope for developing new hydroelectric projects on the western rivers (Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab), which India can use under specific conditions. India’s notice points to the necessity of revisiting these provisions to facilitate its clean energy agenda, crucial for reducing carbon emissions and supporting sustainable growth.

3. **Cross-Border Terrorism**: The persistent challenge of cross-border terrorism, particularly in Jammu and Kashmir, has been cited as a significant factor impacting the treaty’s effective operation. India argues that hostile activities have disrupted the full and smooth utilization of its water rights. This context adds a security dimension to the need for revisiting the treaty, highlighting how external factors can impede cooperative water management.

### Potential Modifications

India’s aim in seeking modifications likely includes:
- **Updated Allocation Mechanisms**: Revising the terms of water sharing to accommodate increased domestic use and development needs.
- **Enhanced Hydropower Utilization**: Modifying treaty clauses to expand the scope for India to develop more hydropower projects, ensuring alignment with its clean energy objectives.
- **Addressing Security Concerns**: Integrating mechanisms to safeguard treaty operations from disruptions linked to cross-border tensions and terrorism.

### Impact and Challenges

**Diplomatic Relations**: This move could strain India-Pakistan relations further. The IWT has been one of the few enduring agreements between the two nations, despite their history of conflict. Modifying the treaty may be viewed by Pakistan as an attempt to alter the status quo, potentially leading to diplomatic and regional tensions.

**International Scrutiny**: The IWT has often been praised as a successful example of transboundary water cooperation. A push for revisions may attract international attention, with observers keen to see how the proposed changes will balance India’s developmental aspirations with the treaty’s cooperative spirit.

**Negotiation Complexities**: Modifying a longstanding treaty requires consensus from both parties, which could be challenging given the current political dynamics between India and Pakistan. Reaching a mutually beneficial agreement would demand careful negotiation and possibly third-party mediation.

**Water Management and Sustainability**: Any changes to the treaty must ensure that the restructured framework supports sustainable water use. With climate change impacting river flows and water availability, updates should incorporate adaptive strategies that safeguard long-term water security.

### Conclusion

India’s formal notice to review the Indus Waters Treaty underscores its need to adapt water-sharing agreements to contemporary realities, including population growth, clean energy goals, and security concerns. While the move seeks to address legitimate domestic priorities, it poses challenges for bilateral cooperation and may test the resilience of an agreement that has held through decades of regional volatility. The outcome will depend on the ability of both nations to engage in constructive dialogue that balances national interests with the principles of equitable resource sharing.

> On August 30, 2024, India served a formal notice to review and modify the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) under Article XII (3) to address its growing domestic water needs and adapt to current realities. The move highlights India’s concerns about population growth, agricultural demands, and the need to accelerate hydropower development for clean energy to meet emission targets. Additionally, India cited the impact of cross-border terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir as a factor impeding full utilization of its rights under the treaty. Revising the treaty could strain India-Pakistan relations and will require careful negotiation to balance interests and ensure sustainable water management.

# All eyes on Baku and the climate finance goal

The New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) will be a key determinant of COP29 (also touted as a ‘finance COP’) turning out to be successful. The foundation of climate finance actions is unequivocally centred on addressing the “needs and priorities of developing countries”, as mandated in Article 9 of the Paris Agreement. NCQG, and set to be finalised at COP29, will shape the future of climate finance. COP29 is being held in Baku, Azerbaijan, from November 11 to 22, 2024.

### Unresolved battles

In the debate over the NCQG, countries with diverse interests are taking sharply differing positions, as highlighted in the recent high-level ministerial dialogue on NCQG ahead of COP29. Key unresolved issues include the structure and the scope of the NCQG, the scale of financial contributions, and time frames, and sources. Developing countries insist that the financial burden must not shift unfairly onto them. They emphasise the responsibility of developed countries to provide support, laying stress on the need for equity in climate finance, with a balance between adaptation and mitigation. Their position favours clear, quantitative targets, with a focus on public finance, grants, and concessional loans, alongside specific, predictable time frames of either five or 10 years.

In contrast, developed countries push to broaden the contributor base, advocating for a more inclusive approach to climate finance. They prioritise outcome-driven strategies, targeting low emissions and climate resilience, while exploring innovative financing and flexible, multilayered finance structures.

The $100 billion annual climate finance pledge, made in 2009 and extended to 2025, has been a glaring source of distrust. Developed countries missed the original 2020 deadline, only meeting the target in 2022, undermining faith in their commitments and leaving developing countries struggling with the consequences of delayed action. Moreover, the $100 billion target is woefully insufficient. Trillions are needed. The Standing Committee on Finance estimates that for 48% of costed needs from 98 parties, the amount required for climate action ranges between $5.036 trillion and $6.876 trillion.

Although the OECD reports that the $100 billion goal was met for the first time in 2022, with developed countries mobilising $115.9 billion, the reality exposes serious flaws. There are insufficient resources for adaptation, and the over-reliance on loans, instead of grants, is pushing vulnerable countries further into debt.

Grants-based public finance must be the core of climate finance, with concessional loans supplementing but not replacing it. Private investment is useful for clean energy but falls short in adaptation projects, where the returns are less clear. This investment bias towards mitigation leaves crucial adaptation efforts such as infrastructure resilience and disaster management severely underfunded. Accessing funds from entities such as the Green Climate Fund and Global Environment Facility remains a significant hurdle for developing countries, hindering their ability to adapt.

### Issue with expanding the contributor base

Discussions on expanding the contributor base for the NCQG raise significant concerns regarding equity and the effectiveness of climate finance negotiations. According to submissions on the new collective quantified goal on climate finance, Switzerland and Canada have proposed expanding the contributor base to include additional countries based on criteria such as emissions and GNI per capita (PPP). The Canadian and Swiss proposals largely seek to target China along with oil-producing countries such as Bahrain, Brunei, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Considering climate change impacts, aspects such as vulnerability, energy poverty and human development are extremely important.

The discussions on expanding the contributor base are not new and were pushed during the Paris Agreement talks. Developed countries argued that wealthier nations should step up, citing shifting global economies. The developing countries pushed back, seeing it as an attempt to sidestep the core principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities that underpin climate negotiations. This move was seen as a threat to dilute accountability, shifting the burden away from those historically responsible for the climate crisis. The discussion on the contributor base exceeds the intended mandate, risking delays in crucial negotiations. Given the pressing need for climate action, this debate risks stalling progress at COP29.

The foundation of the NCQG and climate finance commitments should be firmly anchored in Article 9 of the Paris Agreement, which mandates a balance between adaptation and mitigation finance, emphasising public and grant-based finance for adaptation to avoid increasing the debt burden on developing countries.

Yet, developed countries are advancing a narrative focused on “low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development”, which carries significant political implications for their legal obligations under the Paris Agreement and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

This narrative shift appears to be an attempt to dilute explicit responsibilities by broadening the scope of interpretation. Such a shift undermines both the spirit and the letter of Article 9 of the Paris Agreement, violating the principle of pacta sunt servanda, which demands that treaties and agreements be upheld in good faith.

The Standing Committee on Finance (SCF) has updated the operational definition of climate finance. The current definition of climate finance is “Climate finance aims at reducing emissions and enhancing sinks of greenhouse gases, aims at reducing vulnerability, increasing adaptive capacity, and mainstreaming and increasing resilience of human and ecological systems to negative climate impacts, and includes financing for actions identified in a country’s nationally determined contribution, adaptation communication, national adaptation plan, long-term low-emission development strategy, or other national plan for implementing and achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement and the objective of the Convention”.

The absence of an explicit reference to additionality in the adopted definition is a critical oversight, as it leaves room for ambiguity on whether climate finance constitutes new and incremental support. Finance refers to the targeted allocation of public funds from developed to developing countries to support climate mitigation and adaptation, while investment involves the allocation of capital with the expectation of profit, which may not align with climate priorities. Counting private investments as part of the NCQG risks diluting the accountability and the responsibility of developed countries to provide clear, targeted, and equitable climate finance, as private capital often lacks the public purpose and oversight essential to meeting international climate objectives, especially adaptation. Having common accounting frameworks continues to be critical.

### On the NCQG

Developing countries need not only finance but also technology transfer and capacity building as a means of implementation to support both mitigation and adaptation. However, procedural barriers within multilateral mechanisms, which often prioritise ‘value-for-money’ over ‘need-for-money’, can hinder their access to funds.

As COP29 approaches and the NCQG is set to be finalised, the negotiations will decide if climate finance truly addresses the urgent needs of developing countries burdened by the climate crisis they did not cause.

The NCQG’s success hinges on whether it restores faith in multilateralism and rebuilds the fractured trust between developed and developing countries. If the process fails to account for historical responsibility, the unique challenges of developing countries, and the need for capacity building, it risks widening the divide. As the world heads towards Baku, the critical question remains: will the negotiations on global climate finance deliver just outcomes or just promises?

> The New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) is crucial for the success of COP29, known as the "finance COP," focusing on climate finance to support developing nations. Scheduled for November 11-22, 2024, in Baku, Azerbaijan, COP29 aims to finalize the NCQG, shaping future climate finance commitments. As outlined in Article 9 of the Paris Agreement, climate finance actions must prioritize the "needs and priorities of developing countries." Establishing the NCQG is expected to provide a clear pathway for financial contributions and support that enable developing countries to tackle climate change effectively, reinforcing global collaboration for sustainable development and climate resilience.

# Are pro-natalist policies the way to address the ageing population problem?

Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu recently expressed concern about Andhra Pradesh’s ageing population and urged the people of his State to have more children. Days later, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin attended a mass wedding event in Chennai. He said that the Census and delimitation process may encourage couples to give up thoughts of having a small family. Are pro-natalist policies the best way of addressing the ageing population problem? Gita Sen and Udaya Shankar Mishra discuss the question in a conversation moderated by Jagriti Chandra. Edited excerpts:

While India’s Total Fertility Rate dropped to 1.9 in 2021, below the replacement fertility rate of 2.1, implying population stabilisation, there are sharp regional variations. Could you tell us more about the national and regional context of population growth?

   There is often a lot of confusion regarding population growth attaining the replacement level of fertility. Though the population growth in India has slowed down, the country’s population will keep on growing till 2070 as of now, whereas the world population will keep on growing till 2080. This means that our population will stop growing earlier than the world average. The reason behind the trajectory of population growth in India is its population momentum, which can occur after a period of high fertility, and which is when a large cohort of women come into the reproductive age bracket over time. Although the fertility rate declines, they still contribute significantly to the quantum growth in population. The replacement level of fertility rate is indicative of the fact that in terms of replacement reproduction, every mother is getting replaced by another mother. But that does not in any way imply that India’s population growth is going to immediately experience a negative growth rate.

Having said that, We must also elaborate on the birth rate and death rate transition in India, which will give you the the outcome of growth rate. Between 2060 and 2070, the death rate will cross the birth rate curve. Until then, the growth rate will continue. But there is a distinct north-south divide in the growth rate. Population growth in the south is slower than in the north. But the age composition of the population continues to remain in a manner such that it can sustain the population.

There are two concerns which need to be highlighted. One is the issue of sustaining the population, and the other is the aspect of federal representation, which was enunciated by Mr. Stalin. The issue of sustaining the population encompasses the size of the working age population, the size of the non-working population, the population age, structure, and composition. But federal representation is in terms of share of the population of a State, which needs some rethinking. In this regard We had done some work with the last Finance Commission where we added demographic performance in the reading of populations, so that you are not just looking at population count but also qualitative aspects such as longevity.
 
 The scale and pace of ageing is actually measured in terms of the proportion of population that has aged. In 2021, Bihar’s proportion of aged population was 7.7% as against India’s 10.1%. Compare this with Tamil Nadu or Kerala, where the proportion was higher than the national average — 16.5% in Kerala and 13.7% in Tamil Nadu. When this pattern is projected for 2036, the share of the elderly population in Tamil Nadu will grow from 13.7% to 20.8% and in Kerala from 16.5% to 22.8%, whereas in Bihar it will grow from 7.7% to 11%. So, the pace of ageing in the northern States with high fertility is much lower. And I would say this pace of ageing is not only due to reduction in fertility levels, but also due to increasing longevity in southern States.

### Is rapid ageing necessarily a bad thing or is it part of a natural progression in how a population changes over time? What should we really worry about?

  It is part of the natural progression. The question, however, is when you think of the population of a State or a country. There are different kinds of development approaches, and policies towards population and fertility play a big role in whether ageing is something to worry about and how to handle it. So, what we should really worry about are in fact a whole range of development and social factors, including health factors, as a population grows older. These include non-communicable diseases, heart issues, cancers, etc. The second is about jobs and what work is going to be possible for an older population. As the economy becomes more and more IT linked, physical strength and musculature have become less critical. This opens doors for the kind of work that an older population can do. There are other elements too, such as migration, and how one handles gender inequality and care services, which are critical regardless of the age of the population.

 In fact, the pessimistic outlook of ageing is primarily because of the reading of ageing in a static way rather than a dynamic way. A dynamic reading of ageing would take into account life expectancy, which should be moving upwards. Second, the characteristics of the future elderly population would be very different from the present-day elderly population. So, apart from numbers, we should also take into account the characteristics of the ageing population as all the elderly can’t be deemed unproductive.

### Given the pace of ageing in southern States, is having more children the solution?

 In the first half of independent India, we were concerned about a ‘population bomb’. As a result, we tried different policies, such as forced sterilisations, which didn’t work very well and which led to human rights violations. Now we seem to be swinging in the other direction, which is, how can we make people have more babies? We are talking about incentives. The incentives that Mr. Naidu is talking about are absurd. For instance, he mentioned that you can only stand for local elections if you have more than two babies. Earlier policies said one could only stand for local elections if one had less than two babies. So, we keep swinging. If anybody thinks that people will make decisions about electoral participation on the basis of whether they have more or less babies, that is absurd. What happened when we had the disincentive previously? Any local strongman who had five children would simply claim that he had only two and say the remaining three were not his, and that they belonged to either his brother or neighbour. Now if you tell people you need to have two or more, it is very easy to trot out someone else’s child and say these are mine.

### Why do young couples not want to have kids? Shouldn’t government policies also try and understand and study those?

 Since 2015, worldwide, a number of countries, such as Hungary, Poland, Greece, Finland, and Sweden, where ageing is a major issue, have moved in the direction of pro-natalist policies. Under such policies, governments try to increase maternity leave or paternity leave and increase child support or reduce taxation if you have more children. They also try to give cash incentives for people to have children. Why don’t these work? Because of the cost of living. Is there adequate housing? What is the cost of raising a child? What does it cost to put a child in kindergarten and then school? Even in India, these issues are very serious. The other aspect is the big opportunity cost for women, who are largely responsible for the unpaid care of babies. They drop out of work, either permanently or for a short period of time. And when they go back, they would have lost their place in the promotion ladder. So, it is unlikely that women are going to want to have two-three children.

### Given all these regional disparities, what should be at the heart of population policies?

  The human cost, human rights, and gender equality questions. Second, we need to look at the effectiveness of our policies. This can’t be through coercion, but by making them worthwhile in society, which also have financial costs. So, we need to address the the needs of an older population by way of healthcare, or taking advantage of technology to create job opportunities. There is also a huge potential for trained, empathetic carers when we have a very serious employment problem. But we can’t treat our care service workers as though they are cheap labour. We need to take care of them.

But We would like to also add that from an ecological sustainability point of view, maybe it is not such a bad idea to move towards a smaller population size and towards replacement fertility. We need to think of planetary requirements and a standard of living that provides people with a decent way to live, ensures work-life balance, and gender equality.

What we should really worry about are a whole range of development and social factors, including health factors, as a population grows older

> Pro-natalist policies, like those encouraged by Andhra Pradesh's and Tamil Nadu's leaders, aim to address ageing population challenges by promoting higher birth rates through incentives and benefits. While these measures can temporarily boost population growth and support economic balance, they have limitations, including high costs, sustainability concerns, and insufficient long-term impact. Effective solutions require a multi-faceted approach: enhancing workforce productivity through education and skills development, implementing managed immigration to supplement the labor force, leveraging technology to counteract labor shortages, and supporting older adults' active participation in the workforce. Combining these strategies offers a more sustainable approach to demographic challenges.

# India should be part of RCEP, CPTPP: NITI Aayog CEO B.V.R Subrahmanyam

NITI Aayog CEO B.V.R. Subrahmanyam's statement advocating for India’s participation in the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) underscores the potential benefits of deeper economic integration for the country. Both trade agreements represent substantial portions of the global economy and involve key trading partners, providing potential avenues for economic growth, enhanced market access, and strategic positioning in global trade networks.

### Background on RCEP and CPTPP

The **RCEP** is the world’s largest trade bloc, comprising 15 Asia-Pacific nations, including China, Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and the 10 ASEAN countries. It seeks to reduce tariffs, simplify trade, and foster economic cooperation among member nations. India was initially part of the negotiations but withdrew in 2019, citing concerns about the potential for significant trade deficits and insufficient safeguards for its domestic industries, particularly agriculture and manufacturing.

The **CPTPP**, previously known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), is a trade agreement among 11 Pacific Rim countries, including Japan, Canada, Australia, and Mexico. The pact focuses on reducing trade barriers, setting high standards for trade practices, and promoting regulatory cooperation.

### Benefits of Joining RCEP and CPTPP

1. **Enhanced Market Access**: Membership in RCEP and CPTPP would provide India with greater access to some of the largest and fastest-growing markets in the world. This would enable Indian exporters to compete on a level playing field, benefiting sectors like textiles, pharmaceuticals, and IT services.

2. **Strengthened Trade Networks**: Participation would help India strengthen its position in global supply chains, which are increasingly shifting due to geopolitical tensions and the need for diversification. Being part of these trade blocs would enhance India’s attractiveness as an investment destination, fostering economic growth and job creation.

3. **Diversified Trade Partnerships**: India’s inclusion in these agreements would reduce its dependence on a few key trading partners, allowing it to diversify trade partnerships and mitigate risks associated with economic or political shifts.

4. **Alignment with Global Standards**: The CPTPP, in particular, sets high standards for trade, labor, and environmental practices. Aligning with such standards could push domestic reforms, boosting competitiveness and enhancing India's reputation as a reliable trade partner.

5. **Geopolitical Strategy**: Membership in these trade blocs could bolster India’s strategic influence in the Asia-Pacific region, allowing it to balance China’s dominance in regional trade. By being part of the same economic networks as its neighbors and partners, India would have a stronger voice in shaping trade rules and economic policies.

### Challenges and Concerns

1. **Domestic Industry Protection**: One of the main reasons India opted out of RCEP was the fear of being flooded by cheaper imports, especially from China. Concerns remain about the impact on local industries that might struggle to compete with imports in sectors such as agriculture and manufacturing.

2. **Regulatory Standards**: Joining agreements like the CPTPP would require India to meet stringent regulatory and trade standards. This could mean significant policy shifts and adjustments to align with the agreement’s high labor, environmental, and intellectual property norms.

3. **Trade Deficits**: India has historically run trade deficits with many of the RCEP member nations. There are fears that joining such agreements could exacerbate these deficits unless carefully managed through strategic negotiations and phased implementation.

### The Way Forward

To make joining RCEP and CPTPP viable, India would need to take a strategic approach. This would involve:
- **Strengthening Domestic Industries**: Ensuring that Indian industries are competitive enough to leverage opportunities in global markets through support measures like infrastructure improvement, technology upgrades, and policy reforms.
- **Safeguard Mechanisms**: Negotiating protective clauses that prevent market oversaturation by imports, especially for sensitive sectors.
- **Capacity Building**: Equipping small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to participate in global trade by improving access to finance and providing training on compliance with international standards.

### Conclusion

NITI Aayog CEO B.V.R. Subrahmanyam’s call for India’s participation in RCEP and CPTPP reflects the potential economic and strategic benefits of deeper integration into global trade networks. While challenges remain, strategic preparation, targeted reforms, and careful negotiation can position India to harness the benefits of such participation, promoting long-term economic growth and resilience.

Membership could boost India’s economic growth, align it with global trade standards, and increase its strategic influence in the Asia-Pacific region. However, challenges include protecting domestic industries from increased competition, meeting stringent regulatory standards, and managing trade deficits. To join effectively, India would need to strengthen its industries, negotiate safeguard mechanisms, and build SME capacity. Strategic preparation and targeted reforms could enable India to benefit from such trade partnerships and bolster its global trade position.

# Can the state acquire all private property?

A nine-judge Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court, in a majority judgment (8:1), held that not every private resource can be considered a ‘material resource of the community’ to be used by the government to serve the ‘common good.’ This overturns the earlier interpretation formed in 1977 that has been followed by the Supreme Court till 1997.

What are constitutional provisions?

Part IV of the Constitution contains the Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP). These are principles that the government should follow to achieve social and economic justice in our society. Article 39(b) in Part IV provides that ‘ownership and control of material resources of the community are so distributed as best to subserve the common good.’

The Constitution originally guaranteed right to property and compensation for acquisition as a Fundamental Right under Articles 19(1)(f) and 31 respectively. Article 31C was added through the 25th amendment in 1971. It provided an exception that laws made to fulfil the principles under Articles 39(b) and (c) shall not be void on the ground that it violated Fundamental Rights including right to property. In the Kesavananda Bharati case (1973), a 13-judge Bench of the Supreme Court upheld the validity of Article 31C but made it subject to judicial review. In 1978, the right to property was omitted from Fundamental Rights and made a constitutional right under Article 300A. Any law to acquire private property by the government should only be for a public purpose with adequate compensation meted out.

What were earlier judgments?

In State of Karnataka versus Ranganatha Reddy (1977), a seven-judge Bench of the Supreme Court upheld a Karnataka State law that nationalised private bus transport services. Justice V.R. Krishna Iyer wrote a separate ‘afterword’ interpreting the phrase ‘material resource of the community’ contained in Article 39(b). He held that it embraces all national wealth, not merely natural resources, and all the private and public sources of meeting material needs. This minority judgment formed the basis of the Sanjeev Coke Manufacturing Company versus Bharat Coking Coal Limited (1982) case, that upheld the nationalisation of coke oven plants. It was again relied on in Mafatlal Industries Limited versus Union of India (1996).

What is the current ruling?

In Property owners’ association versus State of Maharashtra, a seven-judge Bench referred the issue of interpretation of Article 39(b) to a nine-judge Bench. The current majority opinion (for seven judges including the CJI) held the interpretation of V.R. Krishna Iyer, that every privately-owned property could be used by the state as a ‘material resource’ to ‘subserve the common good’, as a rigid economic ideology that advocates greater governmental control over private resources. Therefore, it was rejected by the majority opinion which said that India has moved on from a socialistic model to a market-based liberalised economic model.

It held that to qualify as a ‘material resource of the community,’ a resource must be ‘material’ and ‘of the community.’ The ‘public trust doctrine’ and context-specific key factors that would determine this are the inherent characteristics of the resource; its impact on community well-being; its scarcity; and the impact due to its concentration in private hands. Hence, certain resources like forests, ponds, spectrum, mines and minerals may fall within the scope of Article 39(b) even if they are privately held. However, not every private resource automatically qualifies just because it meets material needs. The term ‘distribute’ in Article 39(b) also carries a wide meaning that can include both government acquisition and redistribution to private players, as long as it serves the common good. Justice Nagarathna concurred partially with the seven-judge majority while opining that all private resources except ‘personal effects’ like apparel, jewellery etc., can be transformed into a ‘material resource of the community’ through nationalisation, acquisition etc. Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia wrote the sole dissenting opinion where he upheld the interpretation of V.R. Krishna Iyer in the Ranganatha Reddy case and opined that it is for the legislature to decide on how the ownership and control of material resources is to be distributed.

What is the way forward?

Our economy has changed from a socialistic pattern to a liberalised, market-oriented model. The ensuing growth has uplifted vast majority of people from abject poverty. However, there is also a growing inequality that needs to be addressed. This judgment should protect the small farm and forest lands of marginalised sections from forceful acquisitions by the government. Equally important is the sustainable exploitation and distribution of material public resources within the domain of the government.

We must bear in mind that we have not inherited the earth and its resources from our ancestors but have borrowed it from our future generations.

> No, the state cannot acquire all private property. The Supreme Court of India has ruled that only certain types of private resources can be deemed "material resources of the community" under Article 39(b) of the Constitution, which justifies acquisition for the common good. The court emphasized that acquisition depends on specific criteria like the resource's nature, scarcity, and necessity for public welfare. While the state can acquire land and natural resources with due process and compensation under eminent domain, acquiring other private assets requires clear justification and alignment with constitutional principles to prevent unjust state overreach and protect individual rights.

# Are CSR contributions to agriculture properly tracked?

A decade ago, India became the first country to legally mandate Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). Section 135 of the Companies Act 2013 outlines the rules and regulations governing CSR. According to the National CSR Portal, from 2014 to 2023, ₹1.84 lakh crore of CSR funds were disbursed. With the extent of contributions increasing, a question arises: how can CSR help agriculture?

### CSR’s contribution to agriculture

Nearly 47% of the population depends on agriculture for employment, and the fraction of India’s labour force in agriculture is significantly higher than the global average of 25%. Economically, agriculture accounts for 16.73% of India’s GDP. Now that India’s food production is on a relatively stable footing, concerns focus on the degradation of the natural resource base, stagnant farmer incomes, and threats caused by climate change.

Lately, there have been clear signs from corporate entities that they wish to contribute to climate action and sustainability in the agricultural sector in India through their CSR budgets. According to an outlook report prepared by a CSR platform last year, 23% of companies surveyed had “environment and sustainability” as their CSR priority area. Capital requirements and infrastructural development are the most important needs of Indian agriculture today — and this is also where CSR activities have previously contributed and are expected to continue doing so. Some examples of such activities include establishing grain banks, farmer schools, livelihood projects based on agriculture and allied activities, water conservation projects, and energy-efficient irrigation. The recent paradigm shift in agriculture towards sustainability and modern agriculture makes a good case for CSR funds from the private sector.

### The main obstacle

There is an important problem that hinders CSR’s potential in agriculture: there is currently no way to fully determine the extent of funding going into these projects consistently and distinctively, and to categorise them based on targeted sectors of CSR activities. In other words, current reporting mechanisms have little to no emphasis on agriculture-related CSR initiatives. Under activities mentioned in Schedule VII of the Companies Act, activities targeting agricultural sustainability could fall under 11 of the 29 development sectors of CSR allocations. These are gender equality; agroforestry; poverty, eradicating hunger and malnutrition; technology incubators; animal welfare; environmental sustainability; livelihood enhancement projects; conservation of natural resources; rural development projects; socio-economic inequalities; and women’s empowerment. But there’s little chance of tracking the funds spent for agriculture-related initiatives alone because these 11 sectors encompass a great variety of activities, many of which are unrelated to agricultural sustainability, thus affecting reporting and limiting sectoral impact assessments.

Given the importance of agriculture for the Indian economy and its place in the country’s plans and strategies to engender more sustainable growth and effect a just transition, specifying agriculture as a distinct sector in CSR activities is crucial. Transitioning the reporting framework based on sectors receiving funds would also help streamline and better target the available funds, add more meaning to the contributions, and ensure transparency. Likewise, identifying the prevailing sustainability issues vis-à-vis agroecosystems and directing funds according to requirements will help drive tractable changes.

Tracking CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) contributions to agriculture has been an area of concern due to the challenges involved in monitoring and assessing the impact of these initiatives. While India mandates CSR contributions under the Companies Act, 2013 for eligible companies, ensuring transparency and proper allocation of funds across sectors, including agriculture, can be complex. Here’s an explanation of the current state of CSR tracking in agriculture:

### 1. **Regulatory Framework and Mandate**
Under the Companies Act, 2013, companies with a certain turnover, net worth, or profit must allocate 2% of their average net profits over the past three years towards CSR activities. This has led to significant investments in various sectors, including agriculture. However, these contributions are often directed towards a range of activities under categories such as rural development, water management, and environmental sustainability, which may overlap with agricultural initiatives.

### 2. **Challenges in Tracking CSR Contributions**
   - **Broad Reporting Categories**: Many CSR projects in agriculture fall under broad categories such as “rural development” or “environmental projects.” This makes it difficult to distinctly identify and track funds specifically allocated to agriculture.
   - **Diverse Implementations**: CSR contributions to agriculture can vary widely, from supporting farmer training programs to investing in sustainable farming practices, irrigation projects, or technology-driven solutions. The lack of standardized reporting formats for these diverse activities complicates comprehensive tracking.
   - **Third-Party Implementations**: Corporations often partner with NGOs, government agencies, or other organizations to implement CSR initiatives. This can lead to inconsistencies in reporting and tracking the actual allocation and utilization of funds.
   - **Impact Assessment**: While the Companies Act mandates disclosure of CSR activities, the depth of reporting on the actual impact of these contributions varies. The quality and transparency of data on how much is effectively reaching agricultural initiatives and benefiting farmers can be limited.

### 3. **Current Efforts and Tools for Tracking**
   - **Annual CSR Reports**: Companies are required to publish annual reports detailing their CSR activities, which include information about projects and financial allocations. However, the granularity of these reports varies, and they may not always specify agriculture-focused contributions clearly.
   - **Government Oversight**: The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) oversees CSR compliance and has implemented guidelines to ensure accountability. However, monitoring the specific use of funds in agriculture is still developing.
   - **NGO and Independent Tracking**: Some non-profit organizations and independent entities monitor CSR spending and its impact. These groups can provide insights into sector-specific contributions, including agriculture, but comprehensive, nationwide data remains fragmented.

### 4. **Recommendations for Better Tracking**
   - **Improved Reporting Standards**: Implementing more detailed and specific reporting formats could help in accurately tracking contributions to agriculture.
   - **Dedicated CSR Portals**: Creating centralized online platforms where companies must report detailed project-specific CSR spending could improve transparency.
   - **Impact Evaluation Frameworks**: Establishing standard methodologies for evaluating the outcomes and impacts of CSR contributions would help determine the effectiveness of investments in agriculture.

### 5. **Conclusion**
While CSR contributions to agriculture do exist and are significant, the current system of tracking them is not as robust or transparent as it could be. Enhanced reporting standards, better oversight mechanisms, and focused impact assessments are needed to ensure that contributions specifically aimed at supporting agriculture are properly tracked and their benefits effectively evaluated.

> CSR contributions to agriculture in India are mandated under the Companies Act, 2013, but tracking and assessing these contributions effectively is challenging. Reporting often falls under broad categories like “rural development,” making it difficult to isolate agriculture-specific funding. Companies partner with NGOs and other entities, adding inconsistencies to reporting and impact tracking. While annual CSR reports and oversight by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs provide some data, detailed, transparent tracking remains insufficient. Improved reporting standards, centralized tracking platforms, and standardized impact evaluation methods are needed to better monitor CSR contributions and ensure they are benefiting agricultural initiatives effectively.

# The Bahmani dynasty and its architectural grandeur in Bidar

When the Bahmani Sultanate shifted its capital from Gulbarga (now Kalaburagi) to Bidar (previously known as Muhammadabad) in 1422, the ninth ruler of Bahmanis-Ahmad Shah I, faced challenges and struggled with political unrest and factionalism. However, he was successful in maintaining the integrity of the Bahmani dynasty, which had seen impressive growth in the past.

According to the historians, the kingdom was marred by internal strife for power. Despite several hurdles, Ahmad Shah I created an environment that attracted scholars from around the world. Besides promoting art and literature, the Mahmud Gawan Madrasa — an educational institution was established during his rule.

Historians say that shiftingthecapital oftheBahmani kingdom from Gulbarga to Bidar was a strategic move as it made easier to administer thekingdom and theBidar’shilly terrain providedasecurity. Also itsconnectivityto trade routesencouragedtradeand economic growth,andeventually helped it maintain distancefrom rival kingdoms, thatbroughtpoliticalstability to the kingdom.

The Bahmani dynasty had 18 kings and ruled for almost 200 years .It made Gulbarga as its capital for the first 75 years followed by Bidar for over a century. Of the 18 Bahmani rulers, the first eight — Allauddin Hasan Gangu Bahman Shah, Muhammad Shah I, Allauddin Mujahid Shah, Dawud Shah I, Muhammad Shah II, Ghiyas-ud-Din Tahmatan Shah, Shams-ud-din Daud Shah II, and Taj-ud-Din Feroz Shah — made Gulbarga as their capital from 1347 to 1422.

Ahmad Shah I, Ala-ud-Din Ahmed Shah II, Ala-ud-Din Humayun Shah, Nizam-ud-din Ahmad Shah III, Shams-ud-din Muhammad Shah III, Shihab-ud-din Mahmud Shah, Ahmed Shah IV, Ala-ud-Din Muhammad Shah, Wali-ullah Shah and Kaleem-ullah Shah ruled from Bidar as capital between 1422 and 1538.

### The Bidar fort

The imposing Bidar fort is well protected with a three-layered fortification spread across 67 acres with a perimeter of 5.5 km. Its outer walls measure 5-m thick and 10-m high, interspersed with seven gates and 37 bastions. The irregular rhomboid-shaped fort houses palaces, mosques, and courtyards.

The fort has seven grand arched gates, of which the Gumbad Darwaza and Sharaza Darwaza were the two most prominent entrance gates.The other five gates – Carnatic Darwaza, Mandu Darwaza, Kalyani Darwaza, Kalmadgi Darwaza, Delhi Darwaza were named based on their directions.

### Rangeen Mahal

It is one of the preserved palaces in the fort. The square timber columns at the entrance area support a beautifully carved wooden ceiling lying on wooden brackets with pendant banana-bud motifs derived from Indian traditional architecture. The inner walls of the hall are decorated with underglaze-painted tiles depicting foliate designs and flowering vases. The panels are framed by basalt colonnettes inlaid with mother-of-pearl, the carved wooden ceiling and dome with radiating motifs in Rangini mahal may be considered amongst the finest of all Deccani decorative arts.

Takht Mahal(Throne Palace) once housed the splendidthrone of the Bahmanis, and though in ruins , is indicative of the regality of the palace. Diwan-e-Aam has three storied structures. Both the palaces are built around rectangular courtyards.

The Solah Khamba Masjid(16 pillars mosque) was originally a ceremonial audience hall, however, historians believe that the structure was renovated to convert into a space where prayers could be conducted. The roof of the structure consists of a large dome surrounded by small domes.The Fort Complex also houses Gagan Mahal and Tarkash Mahal which are in dilapidated condition.

The Hazar Kothari structure in the fort was built for safe exit of the rulers family during attack from the enemies.According to local historians, there is an underground hall which leads to the outer wall of the fort.

### Cannons recovered

Founder of Team Yuva, Vinay Malge, said that several cannons were scattered throughout the fort on each bastion, ramparts and gates. He recalled that nearly six small cannons were recovered from the moat during restoration taken up by his team members a few years ago. The Karez system (also known as Qanat system) - an ancient Persian technology used for water supply that was introduced by the Bahmani Sultans in the 15th century and the water management system was further expanded and modified by subsequent rulers that played a crucial role in Bidar’s agricultural prosperity. Currently, the Karez system has been damaged or clogged and measures, and steps should be taken to revive and restore the Karez system, Malge says.

The fort’s evolution showcases the cultural and architectural exchange between various dynasties that ruled Bidar. Historians and several authors claim that the Bidar fort was built by Kakatiya ruler-Madhav Varma II in the 10th century. However, the fort underwent significant modifications, expansions, and renovations by subsequent rulers, including Bahmani Sultanate (1347 -1518) Barid Shahi Dynasty (1527-1619), Mughal Empire (1619-1724) Nizam of Hyderabad (1724 -1948). “In every direction, great loops of bleak black crenelations swept over miles over hills and down steep valleys, a seemingly endless expanse of towers and walls, gateways and bastions, arch-shaped merlons and fortified escarpments.” This is how William Dalrymple, an India-based Scottish historian, describes the Bidar fort in his book White Mughals.

### Contributions of Khaja Mahmud Gawan

Khaja Mahmud Gawan has made great contributions to the Bahmani Sultanate; from education to the administrative sector, his initiatives have left a lasting legacy. Due to his honesty towards Bahmani’s,Gawan was offered the post of mansabdar in Alauddin Ahmed Shah’s court, further he was made minister during the reign of Humayun. Later, Muhammad Shah II made Gawan the Prime Minister. His administrative reforms, educational patronage and economic initiatives shaped the Deccan region during the 15th century.

Gawan introduced a streamlined revenue system, boosting trade and commerce. He also divided the kingdom into smaller administrative units for efficient governance and established a fair judicial system.

Mahmud Gawan Madrasa built in 1472, which was considered to be one of the oldest and most influential Islamic educational institutions in India.

The magnificent Madrasa structure reflects the blend of Persian, Arabic and Indian architectural styles. A large rectangular complex with a central courtyard, decorated with intricate stone carvings, calligraphy and ornate tile work on the minaret add to the structure’s grandeur. The structure is protected by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).

The Gawan Madrasa taught Islamic theology, philosophy and mathematics that attracted scholars from different regions. Historians claim that the Library in Gawan Madrasa houses a vast collection of rare manuscripts and books, and also has residential quarters for accommodation for students. Recently, the madrasa was adopted by Shaheen Group of Institutions under the Adopt-a-Heritage scheme and a MoU was signed by ASI in August 2024.

> The Bahmani dynasty, which ruled the Deccan region from the 14th to 16th centuries, left a significant architectural legacy in Bidar, their capital. Known for blending Persian, Turkish, and indigenous styles, Bahmani architecture in Bidar includes grand forts, mosques, palaces, and madrasas. The Bidar Fort is an outstanding example, featuring intricate tile work, expansive courtyards, and defensive structures. The Madrasa of Mahmud Gawan, another iconic structure, showcases the dynasty's commitment to education and culture. These monuments reflect the dynasty's power, artistic sophistication, and the cultural fusion that defined their reign, leaving an indelible mark on India's historical landscape.
