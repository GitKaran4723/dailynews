# Urgent deadline

**G-20 Summit in Rio: Addressing Global Challenges Amidst Geopolitical Tensions**

The recent **G-20 summit in Rio de Janeiro**, hosted by **Brazilian President Lula Da Silva**, underscored critical global issues such as **hunger, poverty**, and **climate justice**, especially for the **Global South**. However, despite ambitious goals and high expectations, the summit’s outcomes fell short, diluted by geopolitical tensions and competing global priorities.

### **1. Hunger, Poverty, and Inequality**
President Lula highlighted the urgency of tackling **global hunger** and **poverty**, describing them as a "scourge that shames humanity." He advocated for policies like taxing the **super-rich**, proposing a **2% global wealth tax** that could generate over $200 billion annually. Such measures could address the stark inequalities that disproportionately affect the **Global South**. However, the **G-20 declaration** lacked concrete action plans for these issues, reflecting a missed opportunity to galvanize global consensus on eradicating poverty.

**Prime Minister Narendra Modi** emphasized that the **Global South** bears the brunt of global crises and advocated for equitable global governance, calling for the reins of decision-making to reflect the aspirations of the majority of the world’s population. Despite this focus, the summit’s declaration offered limited tangible outcomes for poorer nations.

---

### **2. Geopolitical Tensions and Their Impact**
The timing of the Rio summit was overshadowed by pressing global conflicts:
- The **Israel-Gaza conflict**, which erupted after the October 7 attacks, diverted attention and led to a polarizing humanitarian debate. The G-20 declaration expressed only “deep concern” over the situation in **Gaza** without detailing solutions.
- The ongoing **Russia-Ukraine war**, which previously disrupted consensus at the **Bali** and **New Delhi** G-20 summits, remained a divisive issue. The Rio declaration avoided direct mention of Russia, instead focusing on the “suffering” caused by its repercussions on **global food and energy security**.

These geopolitical crises diluted the focus on hunger, poverty, and climate justice, limiting progress on pressing issues for the **Global South**.

---

### **3. Climate Justice and Global Warming**
With **Brazil** set to host **COP31 in 2025**, there were expectations that the G-20 would highlight climate financing and justice. Developing nations have long demanded commitments from developed countries to provide resources for **mitigation**, **adaptation**, and **loss and damage** due to climate change. However, the summit’s timing, following the **U.S. presidential election results**, dampened hopes for strong commitments.

Former U.S. President **Donald Trump’s** campaign rhetoric, including “Drill, baby, drill,” signals resistance to climate action, compounded by his cabinet’s climate skeptics. If Trump wins in 2024, global efforts to tackle fossil fuel exploitation and fund climate initiatives could face significant setbacks.

---

### **4. The Role of the Global South**
The summit was the third in a series hosted by **Global South** nations (Indonesia in 2022, India in 2023), with **South Africa** set to host in 2025. This quartet—**Indonesia, India, Brazil, and South Africa**—bears the responsibility of championing the concerns of developing countries. They must ensure the next G-20 summit prioritizes:
- Concrete plans for **poverty eradication** and **hunger alleviation**.
- Meaningful commitments on **climate finance** and **sustainability**.
- Reforming **global governance** to reflect the realities of the Global South.

---

### **5. The Road Ahead**
As the **G-20 returns to the U.S. in 2026**, the urgency for actionable outcomes intensifies. The Global South must use its leadership to steer discussions toward equitable solutions, leveraging the 2025 summit in South Africa as a platform for unified advocacy. Tackling hunger, poverty, and climate change requires bridging geopolitical divides and ensuring that the priorities of the developing world are not sidelined.

The Rio summit underscored the challenges of multilateral negotiations but also highlighted the need for sustained focus on the concerns of the world’s most vulnerable populations. By aligning G-20 and COP agendas, the Global South can pave the way for a more just and sustainable future.
