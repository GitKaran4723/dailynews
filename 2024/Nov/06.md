# State has no right to acquire every private property, asserts SC

A nine-judge Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court ruled that not all resources owned by private entities can be classified as “material resources of the community” that the government can acquire and use for the “common good.” This significant decision limits the state’s power to take over private assets solely under the pretext of serving public interest, marking a departure from past economic practices.

The judgment pointed out that such state acquisition powers hark back to rigid, socialist economic models where state control over private assets was more common. The court acknowledged that India's economic framework has evolved over the decades, shifting from an era dominated by public sector investments to one where public and private investments coexist and contribute to national growth.

The ruling emphasized the balance between public interest and private ownership, highlighting that the state must respect the rights of private players while pursuing the common good. This decision reflects an understanding of India’s current economic model, which values private investment and entrepreneurship as essential components for growth, innovation, and economic stability.

The court’s observations indicate that while the state has an obligation to act for the welfare of its people, it cannot encroach upon private property without valid, well-founded reasons that align with constitutional provisions. This ruling is significant as it delineates the boundaries of governmental power in the context of private assets, reaffirming the importance of protecting private property rights in a mixed economy.

The judgment signals a move towards fostering a legal and economic environment where private enterprise is respected and protected, encouraging confidence among private investors. It reinforces the principle that state intervention should be measured, necessary, and justified by genuine public interest, not arbitrary or reminiscent of outdated economic doctrines.

In conclusion, the Supreme Court’s ruling establishes a nuanced approach where private property rights are safeguarded, reinforcing the co-existence of public and private investments in India’s economic system. It limits the state’s power to acquire private resources under the guise of serving the community, ensuring that such actions are consistent with modern constitutional and economic principles.

> The Supreme Court's nine-judge Constitution Bench ruled that not all privately-owned resources can be deemed “material resources of the community” for state acquisition under the pretext of serving the “common good.” This decision limits the government’s power to take over private assets without clear justification, moving away from past socialist economic models. The court acknowledged India's shift to a mixed economy where public and private investments coexist. It emphasized that while the state must act for public welfare, private property rights should be respected. This ruling reinforces investor confidence and ensures state intervention is justified and aligned with constitutional principles.

# Rising STEM research demands revitalised education

Higher educational institutions in India face significant challenges. While private engineering colleges, the newer Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT) and universities have expanded access to education over the last few decades, studies show that a vast majority of students graduating from these colleges lack the basic skills that are required by industry. Research institutes have also voiced concerns about the quality of students who wish to pursue higher studies. While industries and premier research institutions have managed with top students from these colleges, there is a problem now. Across various sectors, there is a struggle to find students who are skilled, and it is alarming that the number of students pursuing higher education has dwindled. At this rate, institutions, which are already grappling with the issue of faculty shortages, will face even greater challenges in the years ahead. Large sums of money announced for initiatives such as quantum computing, cybersecurity or artificial intelligence could go underutilised in the absence of qualified talent. This widespread problem threatens the socio-economic fabric of the country.

### Quality of training is an issue

The root cause lies in the quality of training in teaching institutions. Many faculty members are products of their own institutions and are often pressured to chase papers and patents for their colleges to maintain their rankings, often at the expense of scholarship and pedagogy. This results in poor-quality graduates, with a domino effect on industry standards, research output, and faculty quality. While upskilling programmes, outreach initiatives, internships and online courses could address the problem to some extent, these efforts are not scalable enough to meet ever-increasing demand for skilled professionals. This article offers some broad ideas, based on the experiences of the writers, which may be of help. These suggestions call for a rebalancing of current efforts and a more imaginative use of existing resources.

Premier institutes such as the IITs, the Indian Institutes of Information Technology, the National Institutes of Technology, the Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research, the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), and other centrally funded institutions recruit about 5% of India’s undergraduate students. For instance, IIT Bhubaneswar admits fewer than 60 students annually for its computer science programme. In comparison, the private KIIT University admits over 2,000 students a year for the same discipline. Similar comparisons can be made between IIT Madras and private institutions such as SRM and VIT. This means almost all the students in the pipeline to industries and research institutions come from colleges where 95% of the students study. The proposals in this article aim to strengthen this pipeline and foster greater collaboration between research institutions and teaching institutions. To make the distinctions clear in this article, institutions with large undergraduate programmes will be referred to as “teaching institutions” and those focused on research (such as premier institutes) as “research institutions,” even though they engage in both teaching and research. The ideas in this article are for research institutions, teaching institutions, and the agencies that monitor them — all geared toward improving research, pedagogy, and incentive structures. These proposals echo the objectives of the National Education Policy (NEP) and the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF).

The first idea is to stop ranking teaching institutions and their faculty members based heavily on research output, such as papers and patents. Given the lack of a robust research environment in many teaching institutions, this emphasis on research output encourages participation in predatory conferences and publications. India, unfortunately, is a country with a large presence of predatory outlets. As a result, limited resources are diverted from improving pedagogy to producing low-quality research, further degrading student learning outcomes. Ranking teaching institutions separately, based more on their teaching quality, could alleviate some of this pressure.

### Change focus

Until the quality of students entering the pipeline improves, faculty at teaching institutions should focus more on pedagogy and less on research. While this may reduce research output in the short term, it will significantly enhance the quality of education and research in the long term. Teaching institutions should lay greater emphasis on faculty development programmes, mentorship, teacher evaluations, and newer courses, online and offline. Collaborations with research institutions on teaching methods and pedagogy should be strongly encouraged. One way to achieve this is by creating a dedicated teaching track within the academic hierarchy at these institutions, such as ‘teaching assistant, associate and full professor’. Faculty members interested in pursuing research should be encouraged to collaborate with their counterparts in research institutions. Funding agencies can incentivise and mandate such collaborative projects. The ANRF’s Partnerships for Accelerated Innovation and Research (PAIR) programme already calls for such initiatives.

For this idea to succeed, it is important that faculty promotion criteria in teaching institutions are based on pedagogical skills, assessed through appropriate metrics. This can be incentivised through State and Central government funding to establish centres of excellence in pedagogy, such as centres of excellence in research, and by mandating pedagogical components and inter-institutional collaborations when evaluating grant proposals.

### Explore joint agreements

The second idea is for research institutions to establish joint degree agreements with teaching institutions. These agreements should be stronger than one-off workshops or outreach programmes. For instance, top-performing students at teaching institutions could spend their final two years in research institutions, receiving a “hyphenated degree” bearing the insignia of both institutions. To make this feasible, the curricula at teaching institutions must be aligned with those of research institutions, in content and pedagogy. Faculty from research institutions can engage with their counterparts in teaching institutions through regular workshops, on-site visits, and hands-on training in the best pedagogical practices. Resources must be allocated to support these partnerships as they will help reverse the decline in the quality of teaching in undergraduate-focused institutions. This initiative can begin with one research institution partnering with one teaching institution for a couple of degree programmes, and expand gradually.

Such joint agreements would yield three major benefits: improved student quality in research institutions, enhanced teaching and curriculum quality in teaching institutions, and revitalisation of the teaching institutions themselves. Variations of this model already exist on a small scale. For instance, select third-year civil engineering students from NIT Surat spend their final year at IIT Bombay and are automatically admitted to the M.Tech. programme. Similar student-transfer programmes exist between community colleges and research-intensive universities in the United States, significantly improving both access and quality. Many Indian teaching institutions already have agreements with international universities, so there is no reason why such agreements cannot be established in India, and even within the same city. These agreements would not only facilitate student mobility but also promote faculty exchanges between the two types of institutions. The ideas proposed in this article, which advocate a rebalancing of current efforts, can produce two key outcomes: a much needed refocus on pedagogy that will raise the quality of undergraduate education; and an improvement in research output as a result of less pressure on faculty. These proposals do not require major additional resources, but only a willingness to embrace creative thinking. While science and engineering have been used as examples, the ideas here are equally applicable to fields such as the arts, humanities, and social sciences. Revitalising the country’s teaching institutions is critical to producing a larger, higher-quality talent pool, capable of driving innovative research and scientific discoveries.

> The increasing demand for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) research calls for a revitalized approach to education. To foster innovation and meet global challenges, educational systems must focus on hands-on learning, interdisciplinary approaches, and critical thinking skills. Strengthening STEM curricula can bridge the gap between academic theory and practical application, preparing students for advanced research and real-world problem-solving. Investment in teacher training, modern infrastructure, and access to resources is essential to nurture creativity and curiosity. Revamped STEM education will equip students to contribute effectively to scientific advancements and maintain a competitive edge in the evolving research landscape.

# On India-Canada diplomatic relations.

Tensions between Canada and India have risen following Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s allegations of potential Indian intelligence links to the killing of Canadian citizen Hardeep Singh Nijjar, whom India classified as a Khalistani terrorist. Although Nijjar faced no criminal charges in Canada, he was on a no-fly list and had his bank accounts frozen. This diplomatic rift led to both countries expelling their top diplomats and has intensified tensions between Hindu and Sikh communities in Canada.

### Historical Context of India-Canada Relations

India has long been critical of Canada’s perceived leniency toward Khalistani separatists and extremists. The most notable grievance is Canada’s handling of the 1985 Air India bombing, carried out by Canada-based Khalistani extremists, which killed 329 people, including children. This attack was the deadliest airline terrorism incident before 9/11, and India has frequently pointed to Canada’s perceived failure in preventing the bombing and lack of support during subsequent investigations.

The Air India bombing left a lasting scar on India-Canada relations, and the perceived tolerance of extremist rhetoric within Canada’s borders has remained a sore point. India views Canada’s inaction as evidence of its role as a safe haven for Khalistani groups who advocate for the separation of Punjab from India.

### The Sikh Community and Political Influence in Canada

The Sikh community constitutes only about 2% of Canada’s population but holds significant political influence due to its geographic concentration, particularly in areas with substantial Sikh populations. This has translated to notable political representation; at one time, there were four Sikh ministers in Trudeau’s cabinet, and many Sikh MPs belong to Trudeau’s Liberal Party. This representation is not unique to the Liberals; other parties also seek support from the Sikh community.

The concept of a “vote bank,” common in Indian politics, does not translate directly to Canadian political terminology. However, there is a perception in India that the Trudeau government’s engagement with Sikh issues is motivated by political expediency. While the Canadian government removed terms like “Sikh” and “Khalistani” from reports identifying extremist threats, there is no concrete public evidence that the Trudeau government’s allegations against India are driven solely by appeasing a Sikh voter base, which contains only a minority of Khalistan supporters.

### Political Implications and Accusations

Mr. Trudeau’s government has faced criticism for failing to counter Chinese interference in Canadian elections, leading to a public inquiry into foreign involvement in Canadian politics. Against this backdrop, making allegations about Indian involvement in Nijjar’s killing could be seen as an attempt to project a stronger stance on foreign interference and bolster the government’s fragile image on this issue.

Evidence of Canada’s complex relationship with the Sikh community includes its parliament marking Nijjar’s killing with a moment of silence, Trudeau and other leaders attending events featuring Khalistan flags, and the glorification of Talwinder Parmar, the mastermind of the Air India bombing. While these gestures may appear to signal tacit support for Khalistani sympathies, they are part of broader political outreach that all major Canadian parties, not just Trudeau’s Liberals, have engaged in.

Despite affirming support for India’s territorial integrity, Trudeau’s government has not explicitly condemned Khalistani extremism, adding to the perception of a lack of decisive action. However, recent surveys show that 54% of Canadian Sikhs intend to vote for the Conservative Party in the next election, while 21% support the Liberal Party, suggesting that political support among Sikhs is varied and not as India perceives it.

### Conclusion

The diplomatic rift between Canada and India reflects deep-seated historical and political complexities, with Canada’s handling of Khalistani extremism remaining a significant issue for India. While the Sikh community in Canada holds political influence, the allegations made by Trudeau against India may also be linked to domestic political pressures and an effort to address foreign interference concerns. This situation highlights the delicate balance in Canada-India relations, driven by both historical grievances and contemporary political realities.

> Tensions between Canada and India escalated after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau alleged potential Indian intelligence involvement in the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Canadian citizen labeled a Khalistani terrorist by India. This led to the expulsion of top diplomats and heightened Hindu-Sikh tensions in Canada. India has long criticized Canada for being lenient toward Khalistani extremists, citing failures like the 1985 Air India bombing. The Sikh community, influential in Canadian politics, is often linked to these issues, though not all support Khalistan. Trudeau’s stance may be influenced by political pressures, including bolstering his image amid concerns about foreign interference.
