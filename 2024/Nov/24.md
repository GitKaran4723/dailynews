# Deadlock over climate finance pushes COP29 to brink of failure

**COP29 in Baku: Struggles Over a New Climate Finance Target**

The **UN climate summit (COP29)** in **Baku** has underscored the persistent divide between developed and developing nations over climate finance, leaving critical negotiations for the **New Collective Quantitative Goal (NCQG)** unresolved despite extended discussions. Scheduled to conclude on Friday, the conference ran into overtime on Saturday with little progress, reflecting the challenges of global climate diplomacy. The NCQG aims to establish a new financial framework to support developing countries in addressing climate change, but disagreements over its scope, structure, and equity have hindered consensus.

### **1. The New Collective Quantitative Goal (NCQG)**
The NCQG seeks to replace the longstanding $100 billion annual climate finance commitment made by developed nations in 2009, which remains unmet. It aims to:
- Mobilize significantly larger funds to meet the rising costs of mitigation, adaptation, and loss and damage.
- Address the needs of developing countries facing disproportionate climate impacts due to historical emissions by developed nations.
- Align financial commitments with the goals of the **Paris Agreement**, particularly limiting global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.

The new framework is expected to account for the unique vulnerabilities of least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing states (SIDS), while also facilitating technology transfer and capacity-building efforts.

---

### **2. Key Challenges at COP29**
The inability to reach an agreement on the NCQG reflects deep-seated tensions and differing priorities between developed and developing nations:

- **Unmet Promises**:
  - Developing countries have expressed frustration over the failure of developed nations to deliver the original $100 billion annual target, eroding trust and confidence in new pledges.
  - Many developing countries view the NCQG as an opportunity to rectify past shortcomings and demand accountability.

- **Disagreement Over Scope**:
  - Developed nations emphasize leveraging **private finance** to meet ambitious financial targets, but developing nations insist on prioritizing **public finance**, which is more reliable and equitable.
  - Questions remain about the allocation of funds, particularly for **loss and damage**, adaptation, and capacity building.

- **Equity and Responsibility**:
  - Developing nations argue that the **“polluter pays” principle** and historical emissions must guide financial contributions, placing a greater burden on developed countries.
  - Developed nations counter that emerging economies, such as China and India, must also contribute more significantly given their growing emissions.

- **Accountability and Transparency**:
  - Mechanisms to track and ensure the effective use of funds remain contentious, with developing nations seeking greater clarity on fund disbursement and utilization.

---

### **3. Implications of the Stalemate**
The failure to make significant progress at COP29 has several implications:
- **Widening the Trust Gap**: The inability to agree on the NCQG risks deepening mistrust between developed and developing nations, potentially hampering future climate negotiations.
- **Impact on Vulnerable Countries**: Delays in establishing robust financial frameworks leave LDCs and SIDS more vulnerable to climate impacts, increasing their reliance on short-term, inadequate aid.
- **Risk of Unilateral Action**: Prolonged disagreements may prompt countries to pursue independent climate strategies, weakening collective global action.

---

### **4. The Road Ahead**
To move forward, stakeholders must address the underlying tensions and focus on inclusive solutions:
- **Rebuilding Trust**: Developed countries must honor past commitments and demonstrate good faith by scaling up public finance.
- **Innovative Mechanisms**: Exploring hybrid models combining public and private finance, while ensuring transparency and accessibility for vulnerable nations, can help bridge differences.
- **Focus on Equity**: The NCQG must reflect the principle of **common but differentiated responsibilities (CBDR)** to ensure fairness and inclusivity.

---

### **Conclusion**
The stalemate at COP29 reflects the complexity of aligning diverse national interests with the urgency of global climate action. While the lack of progress on the NCQG is disappointing, the continued discussions highlight the determination of nations to find common ground. Moving forward, a collaborative, transparent, and equity-driven approach will be essential to mobilize the financial resources needed to prevent catastrophic climate impacts and foster a sustainable, inclusive future for all.

> The **COP29 summit in Baku** failed to achieve significant progress on the **New Collective Quantitative Goal (NCQG)**, a financial framework to support developing nations in addressing climate change. Disagreements persist between developed and developing countries over unmet $100 billion pledges, the balance between public and private finance, and equitable responsibility. Developing nations demand greater public finance and accountability, while developed countries advocate for leveraging private funds. The deadlock exacerbates trust issues and leaves vulnerable nations without adequate support. Moving forward, honoring past commitments, ensuring equitable contributions, and fostering transparency are essential to bridge divides and advance global climate action.

# Govt. unfazed by high import bills and trade deficit spikes

**Addressing India’s Rising Import Bills and Trade Deficit**

India’s recent surge in import bills, with record-high goods imports reaching $66.34 billion in October 2024, has raised concerns about its trade deficit, which stood at $27.14 billion for the same month. The rise in imports is attributed to India’s faster economic growth compared to the rest of the world, as well as the import of critical inputs like electronics and precious metals used in export-oriented goods. While the uptick in exports, which grew by 17.5%, partially offsets the deficit, addressing the rising import bill and trade gap requires a comprehensive approach.

---

### **1. Understanding the Challenges**
The import surge and trade deficit arise from a combination of factors:
- **High Import Dependency**: India depends heavily on imports for critical sectors such as energy (crude oil, natural gas), electronics, and precious metals.
- **Global Economic Slowdown**: Sluggish growth in developed economies reduces the demand for Indian exports, widening the trade gap.
- **Export-Driven Imports**: A significant portion of imports, such as components for electronics or raw materials, are used to manufacture goods for export, making outright import restrictions counterproductive.
- **Rising Consumption**: India’s robust economic growth and expanding middle class drive higher consumption of imported goods, particularly electronics and luxury items.

---

### **2. Policy Solutions**
To address rising import bills and trade deficits, India must adopt a mix of short-term measures to manage imports and long-term strategies to boost domestic production and export competitiveness.

#### **A. Enhancing Domestic Production**
- **Focus on Make in India**: Encourage local manufacturing of high-import goods such as electronics, machinery, and semiconductors. For example, strengthening the **Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme** for sectors like electronics and pharmaceuticals can reduce dependency on imports.
- **Renewable Energy Investments**: India’s energy imports, particularly crude oil, constitute a large portion of its trade deficit. Accelerating investments in renewable energy, such as solar and wind, can reduce fossil fuel imports.
- **Support for Domestic Mining**: Enhancing domestic extraction and processing of precious metals and rare earth elements can cut down on imports of these high-value goods.

#### **B. Export Promotion**
- **Value-Added Exports**: Focus on exporting high-value goods rather than raw materials. Strengthening sectors like electronics, automobiles, and engineering can help India capture more value in global trade.
- **Market Diversification**: Explore non-traditional markets in Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia to reduce dependency on slow-growing developed economies.
- **Export Incentives**: Simplify and expand schemes like **RoDTEP (Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products)** to make Indian goods more competitive internationally.

#### **C. Import Substitution**
- **Encourage Local Alternatives**: Provide incentives for domestic production of consumer goods like electronics, reducing dependency on imports from countries like China.
- **Tariff Adjustments**: While outright restrictions are not advisable, calibrated tariffs on non-essential imports can dissuade excessive inflow while protecting domestic industries.

#### **D. Improving Trade Logistics**
- **Reduce Supply Chain Bottlenecks**: Investments in port infrastructure, digitized customs processes, and integrated logistics networks can reduce costs for exporters and improve trade balance.
- **Ease of Doing Business**: Streamlining regulations for exporters and manufacturers can help them compete more effectively in global markets.

#### **E. Bilateral and Multilateral Trade Agreements**
- **Trade Agreements**: Negotiate favorable trade deals with key partners to secure lower tariffs on Indian exports and ensure access to critical imports at competitive prices.
- **Regional Cooperation**: Strengthen ties within organizations like **ASEAN** and **SAARC** to create regional trade advantages.

---

### **3. Structural Reforms**
- **Skill Development**: Train the workforce in advanced manufacturing techniques and high-tech industries, reducing reliance on imported expertise and components.
- **R&D Investments**: Increase public and private spending on research and development to foster innovation and reduce dependency on imported technology.

---

### **4. Monitoring and Adaptation**
- **Real-Time Trade Analysis**: Use advanced data analytics to monitor trade trends and adjust policies dynamically.
- **Balanced Approach**: While managing imports is essential, measures must ensure that export-driven imports or inputs for key industries are not unduly restricted.

---

### **Conclusion**
India’s rising import bills and trade deficit reflect the challenges of managing a rapidly growing economy in a globalized world. Addressing these issues requires a balanced approach, focusing on boosting domestic production, enhancing export competitiveness, and fostering self-reliance in critical sectors. By leveraging initiatives like **Make in India**, expanding renewable energy, and improving trade logistics, India can reduce its import dependency and strengthen its position in global trade. A combination of strategic policies, technological advancements, and targeted reforms can ensure sustainable economic growth and a more balanced trade environment.

> India's record-high import bills, reaching $66.34 billion in October 2024, and a trade deficit of $27.14 billion reflect dependency on imports for critical sectors like energy, electronics, and precious metals. To address this, India must focus on enhancing domestic production through initiatives like **Make in India** and the **PLI scheme**, promoting renewable energy, and encouraging local manufacturing of high-import goods. Boosting exports via market diversification, value addition, and export incentives is essential. Strategic policies such as calibrated tariffs, improved trade logistics, and favorable trade agreements can reduce import reliance. A balanced approach is critical for sustainable growth and trade balance.

# What can CAQM do to improve Delhi air?

Air pollution in Delhi has been in the ‘severe’ and ‘severe plus’ category for the most part of the last 10 days. This week, the Supreme Court pulled up the **Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM)**, the government’s monitoring agency, on its inadequate pollution control response.

### What is the CAQM?

The CAQM in the National Capital Region (NCR) and adjoining areas came into existence through an ordinance in 2020, which was later replaced by an Act of Parliament in 2021. The CAQM was set up for better coordination, research, identification and resolution of problems surrounding air quality and connected issues. It initially had 15 members, comprising officials, past and present, of the environment ministry and other departments of the Union government, as well as officials of various State governments, and representatives from NGOs and other agencies. The CAQM is now headed by Rajesh Verma and there are 27 members.

The CAQM replaced the **EPCA (Environmental Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority)**, which was formed in 1998 by the Supreme Court. However, the EPCA was not backed by a statute and experts had raised the issue that it lacked the teeth to act against authorities which did not follow its orders. Despite that drawback, it was under the EPCA that many of the measures being followed by the CAQM started, including the Graded Response Action Plan or GRAP, a list of temporary emergency measures to control air pollution.

### What are the powers of CAQM?

Under the Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas Act, 2021, the CAQM was given the power to take all measures, issue directions and entertain complaints, as it deems necessary, for the purpose of protecting and improving the quality of air in the NCR and adjoining areas. Under Section 14 of the Act, the CAQM can initiate stringent actions against officers for not following its orders.

### Why did the SC pull up the CAQM?

Over the years, the Supreme Court which has been hearing an ongoing case on air pollution, has pulled up different governments and agencies for their laxity. On September 27, Justice A.S. Oka and Justice Augustine George Masih orally observed about CAQM: “Like pollution, your directions are in the air.” The court was referring to various stakeholders not following the CAQM’s orders despite specific provisions under the 2021 Act. “There has been total non-compliance of the Act. Please show us a single direction issued to any stakeholder under the Act... We are of the view that though the Commission has taken steps, it needs to be more active. The Commission must ensure that its efforts and directions issued actually translate into reducing the problem of pollution,” the Bench observed. On November 18, the Supreme Court slammed the CAQM for delayed action while directing stringent curbs under Stage IV of the GRAP and noted that rather than taking pre-emptive action to contain air pollution, it waited in vain for the air to improve. Stage IV is the highest level of restrictions under GRAP, and according to the CAQM’s rules, it is supposed to be implemented when the air quality category is likely to fall to ‘severe plus’, and is likely to remain in that level for three or more days. The court pulled up the CAQM for delaying implementation of curbs though the AQI had slipped to the ‘severe plus’ category.

### Is the CAQM to blame for Delhi’s pollution?

Though the CAQM makes plans and coordinates with different agencies, it is the agencies that have to implement them on the ground.

An official of the CAQM said the commission has improved coordination and planning. “For example, though the paddy stubble burning, which is a source of severe pollution, happens in October-November, we start meeting State officials from February and continue talks till the season is over,” the member said. The CAQM had also coordinated with Punjab and Haryana to prepare action plans for controlling stubble burning in 2022 and it is updated every year.

About challenges that the commission faces, the official said, “Over the years, though we were looking at different sources of pollution and trying to control them, our main focus was on controlling stubble burning. But from now onwards, we will try to focus on multiple areas. We will be putting more energy and time on controlling dust and vehicular pollution too.”

Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment, said that the decision to impose GRAP should be taken proactively by the CAQM. Pollution forecasting methods have to be more accurate, she added.

> The **Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM)** can improve Delhi's air quality by enforcing strict measures to tackle pollution sources. Key actions include:

1. **Controlling Stubble Burning**: Promote alternatives like Happy Seeders and bio-decomposers while monitoring via satellite data.
2. **Curbing Vehicular Emissions**: Expand public transport, enforce emissions standards, and promote electric vehicles (EVs).
3. **Industrial Pollution Control**: Ensure industries switch to cleaner fuels and follow emission norms.
4. **Construction Dust Management**: Mandate dust suppression measures and penalize violators.
5. **Public Awareness**: Launch campaigns to encourage green practices.
6. **Real-Time Monitoring**: Enhance air quality data systems for swift interventions.

A multi-sectoral approach and strict enforcement are essential.

# Why is there a row over climate finance?

The **29th edition of the Conference of Parties (COP)**, arguably the most important of the UN’s climate conferences, was scheduled to end on November 22, after 11 days of negotiations, and take a collective step forward in addressing rising carbon emissions. However, deliberations are expected to carry on beyond the deadline with several sticking points outstanding.

### What is the significance of COP29?

Going into the talks, developing countries had stated that at least a trillion dollars per year from 2025-35 would be necessary to meet emission targets. This was seen to be the **New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG)** on climate finance which refers to money that will be given to developing countries by developed countries to help the former meet their goals to transition away from the continued use of fossil fuels and curb greenhouse gas emissions. Developing countries have been repeatedly saying that the figure should be “trillions of dollars.” To this end, developed countries have mobilised and transferred $115 billion in 2021-22 — a controversial clause that has yet to be resolved in the universal agreement — but per the Paris Agreement, a new target higher than $100 billion must be agreed upon by 2025. The talks in Baku were expected to conclusively agree upon a number but there continues to be a sharp split between developed and developing countries on the quantum and other basic aspects of what this NCQG should look like.

### What do developing countries want?

This block of countries include China, India and the Group of 77 countries. There are also other coalitions such as the **Like Minded Developing Countries (LMDC), Least Developing Countries (LDC), Small Island Developing Countries (SIDS)** etc. Nearly all developing countries fall into one or multiple groupings and while they have differences, they are largely agreed on the point that it is the developed countries that should pay the bulk of climate finance.

More importantly, they specified that this money had to be provided not only to help countries meet their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) but also buffer against existing threats of climate change, and make good for climate damage already wrought. The NDCs are targeted, voluntary plans by all countries to reduce carbon emissions by certain quantities until 2030. The NCQG, the developing countries say, should also reflect contributions by developed countries on the basis of their historical contribution to existing carbon concentrations in the atmosphere as well as their per capita GDP. To put this in perspective, it is important to note that even if all countries fulfilled their stated voluntary commitments, it would as of now only translate to a 2% cut, and this year — the latest scientific assessments suggest — carbon emissions will likely increase 0.8% over 2023.

### What does the developed world say?

However developed countries, led by the European Union, say these demands are unreasonably high. They aver that “all actors” (read countries) should collectively work to hike up climate finance to $1.3 trillion per year by 2035. While agreeing that they must “take the lead” they have only a set a goal of $250-300 billion by 2035 per year. Moreover this would consist of a “variety of sources,” including “public and private, bilateral and multilateral, and alternative sources.”

This suggests that another major demand of the developing world, of ensuring most of the money is in the form of grants or low-cost loans, remains unmet.

### Have any concrete agreements been made?

A week before the conference began, China had petitioned the Presidency of COP29 to discuss “climate-change related unilateral restrictive trade measures” at the conference. This is an unusual request as trade issues are discussed on forums such as the World Trade Organization. China proposed this as part of a grouping of countries called BASIC (Brazil, South Africa, India, China).

The petition is primarily directed at a European Union proposal called the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), which imposes a tax on products imported into the EU that don’t conform to carbon-emission norms required by the Union. The CBAM is currently operating in a “transitional phase” but will come into full effect from January 1, 2026.

The first day of the conference saw an agreement on carbon markets to be supervised by the UN. Such a market would allow countries to trade carbon credits — certified reductions of carbon emissions — among themselves and whose prices are determined as a consequence of emission caps imposed by countries.

The market itself follows from a section in the Paris Agreement, called Article 6. Sub- sections within the Article spell out how countries can bilaterally trade carbon among themselves (Art 6.2) and participate in a global carbon market (6.4). Though most of the necessary nuts and bolts to make operational such a carbon market, supervised by a United Nations body, were in place since 2022, there were several niggles, particularly on ensuring that the carbon credits generated are genuine and its antecedents are transparent.

While there is criticism among environmentalist groups that enough discussions on this didn’t take place, this is supposed to be a mechanism to facilitate climate finance. India has been discussing bilateral deals to trade carbon with several countries. An agreement such as the one in Baku could be a catalyst, and activate India’s own carbon-trading market.

> The row over **climate finance** stems from disputes between developed and developing nations over funding responsibilities to combat climate change. Developing countries demand greater **public finance** from developed nations, emphasizing their historical emissions and the need for equitable support for mitigation, adaptation, and loss and damage. Developed nations push for leveraging **private investments**, which developing countries argue are unreliable and inaccessible for vulnerable regions. The failure to meet the $100 billion annual climate finance commitment has deepened mistrust. Additionally, debates over transparency, fund allocation, and accountability further exacerbate disagreements, leaving critical issues unresolved at summits like **COP29**.
