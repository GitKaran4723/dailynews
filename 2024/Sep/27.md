# Centre advises Indian nationals to leave Lebanon, mulls naval evacuation

India has issued a **strong advisory** to its nationals to leave **Lebanon** immediately due to escalating violence in the region. The advisory comes in the wake of **Israeli bombing raids** over southern Lebanon and the capital, **Beirut**, which have intensified in the past three days. This is part of a broader conflict that began with **Hezbollah**, a Lebanese armed group, launching rockets into Israeli cities such as **Safed** and **Haifa** following a series of Israeli airstrikes aimed at Hezbollah targets in Lebanon.

The **Embassy of India** in **Beirut** has urged Indian citizens not to travel to Lebanon and advised those currently in the country to leave. For those unable to leave immediately, the embassy recommends exercising **extreme caution**, restricting movements, and maintaining close contact with the embassy through email or emergency phone numbers. There are around **3,000 Indians** living in Lebanon, and official sources have suggested that the **Indian government** is considering a **naval evacuation** to ensure the safety of its citizens in case the situation deteriorates further.

This is the first advisory issued by India since the conflict began, with the security situation rapidly worsening following cross-border attacks between Hezbollah and Israel. Given Lebanon’s fragile political and economic state, the renewed hostilities could exacerbate the situation, posing significant risks to foreign nationals in the country. The advisory reflects India's commitment to ensuring the safety of its citizens abroad during times of crisis. 

As tensions escalate between **Israel and Hezbollah**, with airstrikes and missile exchanges intensifying, there is growing concern that the conflict could spiral into a larger regional war, drawing in more actors and complicating evacuation efforts.

The escalating violence between **Israel** and **Hezbollah** in Lebanon and the subsequent advisory for Indian nationals to leave Lebanon will have several implications for India:

### 1. **Impact on Indian Nationals**:
   With **3,000 Indian nationals** currently residing in Lebanon, most of them working in industries such as construction, services, and skilled labor, their safety becomes a priority. The advisory issued by the Indian government may lead to an **evacuation operation**, similar to previous efforts like **Operation Rahat** during the Yemen crisis in 2015. Ensuring the safe return of these citizens may place logistical and financial pressures on India.

### 2. **Geopolitical Implications**:
   The ongoing conflict could strain India's **diplomatic relations** with both **Israel** and the **Arab world**. India maintains strong ties with Israel, especially in defense and technology sectors, and at the same time, has deep historical and strategic relationships with Arab nations, including Lebanon. Increased hostilities could force India to navigate a delicate **diplomatic balancing act**, maintaining its neutral stance while prioritizing peace and stability in the region.

### 3. **Energy Security**:
   The **Middle East** is a critical source of India's **energy supplies**, with a significant portion of India's crude oil imports coming from the region. Prolonged conflict in the Middle East can **disrupt energy supplies**, lead to price fluctuations, and increase India's energy costs, affecting both the economy and its industrial sectors.

### 4. **Economic and Trade Effects**:
   Lebanon itself is not a major trade partner for India, but continued instability in the region could affect **India’s broader trade** with the **Middle East** and **West Asia**, especially in terms of **exporting goods** and **remittances** sent by Indian workers in the Gulf region. Lebanon serves as a commercial and logistical gateway for some West Asian markets, and disruptions there can have cascading effects on trade routes and regional commerce.

### 5. **Security Concerns**:
   The growing tensions and involvement of terrorist organizations like **Hezbollah** raise **security concerns** for India, which has its own issues with terrorism. There is a possibility of **spillover effects** from the conflict, especially in terms of how global terror networks may influence militancy and extremism. Additionally, any escalation involving **Iran**, which supports Hezbollah, could have further implications for India, given its energy and strategic ties with Tehran.

In summary, while the direct economic ties between India and Lebanon may not be substantial, the **regional instability** in **West Asia** has far-reaching consequences for India, particularly in terms of **energy security, geopolitical strategy**, and the safety of **Indian nationals**. The situation demands careful diplomatic maneuvering and preparedness to mitigate potential disruptions.

> India has advised its nationals to leave **Lebanon** due to escalating violence following **Israeli bombing raids** in response to attacks from **Hezbollah**, a Lebanese armed group. The **Indian Embassy** in **Beirut** issued an advisory urging citizens to avoid travel to Lebanon and for those in the country to leave immediately or exercise caution. Around **3,000 Indians** reside in Lebanon, and the **Indian government** is considering a **naval evacuation** due to the deteriorating security situation. The advisory follows **cross-border hostilities** between Israel and Hezbollah, which began with Hezbollah's rocket attacks on Israeli cities, escalating into an ongoing conflict.

# The Karnataka government has decided to reject the Kasturirangan Committee report,

The **Karnataka government** recently announced its decision to reject the **Kasturirangan committee report**, which sought to protect **Ecologically Sensitive Areas (ESAs)** in the **Western Ghats** from environmental degradation. This decision, despite earlier indications that the report would be reviewed, marks a significant policy stance by the state. The **Kasturirangan report**, submitted in **2013**, aimed to balance ecological preservation with developmental needs in the Western Ghats, a biodiversity hotspot recognized for its rich flora and fauna and its importance in regulating the regional climate.

### Background of the Kasturirangan Report

The Kasturirangan committee was formed after widespread opposition to the earlier **Madhav Gadgil report** (2011), which recommended strict environmental regulations in the Western Ghats. The Gadgil report was considered too stringent by many state governments, including Karnataka, as it proposed large-scale restrictions on development activities to preserve around **75% of the Western Ghats** as an ESA. The **Kasturirangan committee**, formed to ease these concerns, recommended reducing the ESA to cover around **37%** of the Western Ghats region.

The report also advocated for a **ban on mining, quarrying, and certain construction activities** in the ESAs, as well as tighter regulation of industrial projects. The idea was to safeguard the environment without hampering the economic development of local communities. While the central government and environmentalists largely supported the Kasturirangan report, it faced strong opposition from various state governments and local communities.

### Karnataka Government’s Stand

Despite months of deliberation, the Karnataka government rejected the report, stating that implementing the recommendations would harm the livelihoods of people residing in the Western Ghats region. The decision was driven by concerns from local communities, who feared that the restrictions on land use and industrial activities would severely impact agriculture, infrastructure projects, and employment opportunities. Many local residents, farmers, and political representatives have been vocal in their opposition, arguing that the strict environmental measures could curtail developmental prospects in the region.

The state’s decision also comes after considering demands from elected representatives from the **Malnad region**, which encompasses parts of the Western Ghats. These leaders had raised concerns that declaring large tracts of land as ecologically sensitive would lead to land-use restrictions, potentially displacing communities and halting development projects in the area.

### Environmental and Ecological Concerns

Environmentalists and ecologists, on the other hand, have voiced strong opposition to the Karnataka government’s rejection of the Kasturirangan report. They argue that the **Western Ghats**, being one of the world’s eight biodiversity hotspots, need urgent protection to preserve their unique ecosystems and biodiversity. The Western Ghats play a crucial role in maintaining the ecological balance, influencing rainfall patterns, and supporting water resources across peninsular India. Environmentalists warn that failure to implement the report’s recommendations could lead to further environmental degradation, increase the vulnerability of the region to natural disasters like floods and landslides, and threaten its rich biodiversity.

The **2018 Kerala floods** and the frequent landslides in the Western Ghats have been linked to unregulated development in the fragile region, with experts citing the need for stricter environmental safeguards. By rejecting the Kasturirangan report, Karnataka is likely to face increased scrutiny from environmentalists and the broader public over its handling of ecological issues.

### Conclusion

The Karnataka government’s decision to reject the Kasturirangan report reflects the ongoing tension between **environmental conservation** and **developmental needs**. While local communities and political leaders argue for protecting livelihoods and promoting growth, environmentalists stress the need to safeguard the unique ecological balance of the Western Ghats. This decision will likely lead to continued debates on how best to balance these two pressing concerns in one of India’s most important ecological regions. The future of the Western Ghats will depend on finding a sustainable approach that addresses both environmental preservation and the developmental aspirations of its people.

The Kasturirangan Committee was established in 2012 to provide a more balanced approach to the preservation of the Western Ghats, following criticism of the earlier Gadgil Committee report. The key focus of the Kasturirangan committee was to recommend a sustainable development model for the ecologically fragile Western Ghats, while considering the concerns of local communities dependent on the region for their livelihoods.

Key Recommendations of the Kasturirangan Committee:
Demarcation of Ecologically Sensitive Areas (ESAs):

The committee suggested that 37% of the Western Ghats, covering approximately 59,940 sq km, be designated as Ecologically Sensitive Areas (ESAs). This is much lower than the 75% proposed by the earlier Gadgil report.
Developmental Restrictions in ESAs:

The committee recommended prohibiting certain environmentally harmful activities, such as mining, quarrying, thermal power plants, and red-category industries in the ESAs to protect the fragile ecology.
It allowed hydropower projects and eco-friendly tourism with appropriate safeguards.
Sustainable Development:

The report emphasized the need for balancing environmental conservation with the socio-economic needs of the local populations. It proposed that development projects in the non-ESA areas should be allowed with strict environmental regulations.
Involvement of Local Communities:

The committee suggested active involvement of local communities in conservation efforts through the Gram Sabhas to ensure participatory decision-making.
Recommendations for Forest Cover:

The committee identified substantial forest cover in the region that should be protected, while also advocating for afforestation and ecological restoration where necessary.
Implementation at the State Level:

It recommended that the respective state governments should take the responsibility to demarcate the ESAs and implement the recommendations of the report.

> The Karnataka government has decided to reject the Kasturirangan Committee report, which recommended protecting Ecologically Sensitive Areas (ESAs) in the Western Ghats to prevent environmental degradation. The report, which aimed to strike a balance between ecological preservation and development, proposed restrictions on activities like mining and construction in around 37% of the Western Ghats. However, the state government opposed the report due to concerns that these measures could negatively impact local livelihoods, particularly in agriculture and infrastructure development.

# Judge and prejudice

The **Supreme Court of India** has issued a strong reminder to the judiciary, urging judges to avoid making **casual, biased remarks** that can reflect **communal** or **misogynistic** tendencies. The court’s intervention comes in the context of **live-streamed judicial proceedings**, which offer wide visibility beyond the courtroom and can significantly affect public perception. The apex court stressed that judges should maintain **fairness** and **impartiality**, aligning with **constitutional values**, and refrain from letting personal prejudices or off-the-cuff remarks tarnish the integrity of the judicial process.

This admonition arose after the Supreme Court took **suo motu cognizance** of video clips featuring **Karnataka High Court Judge V. Srishananda** making **sexist comments** toward a woman lawyer during two separate judicial proceedings. Additionally, on a previous occasion, the same judge referred to a **Muslim-majority area** in **Bengaluru** as "Pakistan," which was seen as a **communal remark**. Such comments, the Supreme Court noted, not only cast a shadow on the individual judge but also damage the **reputation** and **credibility** of the entire judiciary.

A **Special Bench**, led by **Chief Justice of India (CJI) D.Y. Chandrachud**, observed that the **heart and soul of judging** is to be fair, and judges must maintain **judicial discipline** and adhere to the values enshrined in the **Constitution**. The court highlighted that when judicial remarks cross the line into **bias** or **prejudice**, it impacts the **credibility of the institution** and reduces public faith in the justice system.

The Court's direction serves as a reminder that **judicial decorum** extends beyond legal rulings to encompass how judges interact with lawyers, litigants, and the public during proceedings. In an era where **judicial transparency** is increasing through live-streaming and digital platforms, the **behavior and remarks of judges** are under more scrutiny than ever. Casual remarks, whether **sexist, communal**, or **prejudiced**, have a lasting impact, not just on the individuals involved but on the **institution of justice** as a whole.

This incident reflects a growing consciousness within the Indian judiciary to remain **neutral, accountable**, and in alignment with the evolving societal expectations of **gender sensitivity** and **communal harmony**. It also underscores the importance of judicial officers being mindful of their words and conduct, especially when their statements can be widely circulated and scrutinized by the public.

The Supreme Court’s intervention is seen as an important step toward maintaining the **sanctity** and **dignity** of the judicial institution. By calling out inappropriate behavior and insisting on **higher standards of conduct**, the court is reaffirming the need for judges to act as impartial upholders of the law, free from **personal bias** or **prejudice**.

In summary, the Supreme Court's observations serve as a crucial reminder for the judiciary to uphold the **highest ethical standards**, ensuring that personal biases do not seep into judicial proceedings, thus protecting the **integrity** of the institution and the **trust** of the public in the justice system.

> The **Supreme Court of India** has urged judges to refrain from making **casual remarks** that display **communal bias** or **misogyny**, emphasizing the need for fairness and impartiality. This came after taking **suo motu cognizance** of remarks made by **Karnataka High Court Judge V. Srishananda**, including sexist comments to a woman lawyer and a communal remark referring to a Muslim-dominated locality as "Pakistan." The Supreme Court highlighted the importance of maintaining **judicial decorum**, especially as judicial proceedings are now **live-streamed**, increasing public visibility. The court stressed that such comments can tarnish the credibility of the entire judicial system and affect public trust.

# A life in revolution: Bhagat Singh, a radical thinker and ideologue

**Bhagat Singh** was not just a revolutionary freedom fighter but also a **radical thinker and ideologue** whose ideas transcended mere rebellion against British colonial rule. Born in **1907** in Lyallpur (now in Pakistan), Bhagat Singh grew up in a politically active family that was deeply involved in India’s freedom struggle. His life and writings reveal a young man committed not only to India’s independence but to the cause of **social and economic justice**.

### Early Influence and Revolutionary Ideals

Bhagat Singh’s early exposure to the **Jallianwala Bagh massacre (1919)** and the subsequent **Non-Cooperation Movement** deeply influenced his political outlook. While initially inspired by **Mahatma Gandhi’s** call for nonviolent resistance, Bhagat Singh grew disillusioned with Gandhi’s decision to call off the movement following the **Chauri Chaura incident** in 1922. Bhagat Singh began to align himself with more radical ideologies that advocated for **direct action**.

He joined the **Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA)**, a revolutionary organization, and worked alongside other revolutionaries like **Chandrasekhar Azad**. His shift toward socialism was evident, and he believed that the mere removal of British colonial rule would not solve India's problems unless it was accompanied by the **abolition of class-based exploitation**.

### A Radical Thinker

Bhagat Singh’s understanding of revolution was deeply intellectual. Unlike some of his contemporaries who focused solely on the end of British rule, Bhagat Singh was concerned with the **larger social and economic transformation** of India. He advocated for **socialism** and was heavily influenced by **Marxist ideas**. In his seminal essay, **"Why I Am an Atheist"**, Bhagat Singh challenged not just colonial oppression but also religious dogma, urging people to adopt **rationalism** and **scientific thought**.

His ideas about **revolution** extended beyond nationalism. He saw it as a **social change** that would dismantle inequality, particularly economic inequality. His vision was for a **republic of workers and peasants**, influenced by the **Bolshevik Revolution** in Russia. Bhagat Singh’s commitment to **secularism** was also radical for his time, as he believed that communal divisions would weaken the unity required to overthrow imperialism.

In his June 1928 article, **The Problem of Untouchability**, Singh exhorts the “so-called untouchables, the real sustainers of life” to remember that they “were the backbone of Guru Gobind Singh’s army. Shivaji was able to achieve all he did with your participation and it made him forever shine in history.” Singh urges them to “unite to stand on your own feet and challenge the existing order of society.”

Declaring the idea that “since someone is born in a poor sweeper’s family, he shall continue cleaning toilets all his life” as “utter nonsense”, Singh stokes the depressed classes to “start a revolution from a social agitation.” Singh reminds the untouchables that they “are the pillars of the nation and its core strength. Awake, O sleeping lions! Rebel, raise the banner of revolt.”

In a December 1929 article, **What is Revolution?**, Singh explains, “The spirit of revolution should always permeate the soul of humanity so that reactionary forces may not accumulate to check its eternal onward march. Old order should change, always and ever, yielding place to new, so that one ‘good’ order may not corrupt the world. It is in this sense that we raise the shout ‘Long Live Revolution’.”

In a three-part piece titled, **What is Anarchism?**, published in 1928, Singh reflects, “Anarchists are against God and religion to begin with because they feel this is the root of mental slavery. And then they are against the State because it is the root of physical slavery. They say that motivating people with the temptation of heaven, fear of hell, or with the iron hand of law is the wrong approach and it is also an insult to a superior being like a human.”

In his 1931 Letter to **Young Political Workers**, Singh writes, “According to our definition of the term, **revolution** means the complete overthrow of the existing social order and its replacement with the socialist order... the state, the government machinery is just a weapon in the hands of the ruling class to further and safeguard its interest. We want to snatch it, and handle it, to utilise it for the consummation of our ideal, i.e., social reconstruction on a new, i.e., Marxist, basis.”

### Notable Actions and Legacy

Bhagat Singh’s most famous act of revolution was his participation in the assassination of **John Saunders**, a British police officer, in **1928**, to avenge the death of **Lala Lajpat Rai**. Later, in **1929**, he and his comrades threw non-lethal bombs in the **Central Legislative Assembly** to protest repressive laws. His intent was not to harm but to make the **"deaf" British rulers "hear" the voice of the oppressed**. Bhagat Singh and his colleagues did not escape but courted arrest to use the courtroom as a platform to propagate their revolutionary ideas.

Bhagat Singh was eventually **executed in 1931** at the age of 23. His death, however, did not mark the end of his influence. Over time, he became a **symbol of courage**, **intellectual radicalism**, and **uncompromising nationalism**. His writings and actions have inspired generations of Indians, particularly those involved in **leftist politics**.

### Conclusion

Bhagat Singh's legacy goes beyond his revolutionary activities. He was a profound thinker who recognized the **interconnectedness of political independence, social justice, and economic equality**. His critique of imperialism and capitalism and his vision for an egalitarian society make him a key figure in India’s freedom struggle, but also in broader discussions of **justice and human rights**. His writings remain relevant today, serving as a reminder of the importance of challenging **oppression** in all its forms.

> Bhagat Singh was not only a revolutionary freedom fighter but also a radical thinker and intellectual ideologue. Born in 1907, he was deeply influenced by events like the Jallianwala Bagh massacre and became disillusioned with non-violent approaches after the Chauri Chaura incident. He joined the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) and advocated for socialism and the complete abolition of class-based exploitation.

Unlike many nationalists, Bhagat Singh sought more than just freedom from British rule—he envisioned a social revolution aimed at equality and economic justice. His ideas, influenced by Marxism, were detailed in writings like "Why I Am an Atheist", where he championed rationalism and secularism.

# Storms brewing in East, South China seas

In the last few years, maritime East Asia has become an arena for intensified power politics. The **East China Sea** borders China, Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea. China asserts that the **Senkaku/ Diaoyu islands**, located in the East China Sea and under Japanese control, belong to Beijing. There have been multiple crises over these islands in the past. The **South China Sea** lies between China, Taiwan and five Southeast Asian countries — Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, the Philippines, and Indonesia — and has emerged as one of the most important flashpoints in the **Indo-Pacific**. China has been aggressively pushing its claims in the South China Sea.

### Why are the seas important to China?

China views the East and South China Seas through the prism of **sovereignty, territorial integrity, and national security**. China’s Defence White paper, issued in 2019, declares, **“South China Sea islands and Diaoyu Islands are inalienable parts of the Chinese territory.”** In responding to the criticism regarding China’s activities, it asserts that “China exercises its national sovereignty to build infrastructure and deploy necessary defensive capabilities on the islands and reefs in the South China Sea, and to conduct patrols in the waters of Diaoyu Islands in the East China Sea.” What China perceives as its defensive actions are considered offensive and provocative by the regional countries surrounding the East and South China Seas.

### What is the significance of the seas?

The key maritime trade routes in East Asia pass through these two seas. **Taiwan Strait** is a critical maritime choke point. The region is home to undersea cables that are important for the global digital economy. As per the U.S. Energy Information Administration, in 2023, 10 billion barrels of petroleum and petroleum products and 6.7 trillion cubic feet of liquefied natural gas passed through the South China Sea. It is also home to vast reserves of untapped oil and natural gas.

### What is China doing in the region?

China has been aggressively pushing its territorial claims in both seas in two ways: by building defence-related infrastructure such as ports, military installations, airstrips, and artificial islands and by pushing back against the claims of regional countries. In the East China Sea, China vehemently contested Japanese claims and, both countries found themselves embroiled in multiple crises, the most notable being the arrest of a Chinese captain of a fishing boat in 2010 and Japan’s nationalisation of the Senkaku islands in 2012. These crises saw both countries taking maximalist positions. China had imposed a ban on the export of rare earth minerals to Japan. In the last few years, there has been a slight easing of tensions over the issue regarding the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands. As per the Japan Coast Guard data, 2023 saw the highest level of activity by the Chinese Coast Guard in the contiguous zone of the Senkakus. Owing to China’s assertive foreign policy, its relationship with South Korea, Taiwan and Japan has deteriorated rapidly.

Meanwhile, the **South China Sea** has become a major theatre of Chinese belligerence. The power asymmetry between China and the South China Sea claimant countries is large and is growing continuously. China’s navy is also the largest naval force in the world by numbers. Therefore, the South China Sea is seeing the ever-growing projection of Chinese power. For asserting its claims, China has deployed a Coast Guard and maritime militia. The tactics include dangerous and aggressive manoeuvres at sea, harassing resupply missions, ramming vessels, collisions, and using water cannons and military-grade lasers, etc. These tactics are known as ‘grey zone’ operations, which fall short of war but are designed to alter the status quo.

China has been actively pushing its claims in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of the Philippines. Since 2022, tensions between China and the Philippines have been rising due to a significant increase in the frequency of such incidents. In June-July 2024, multiple incidents of clashes occurred. The Second Thomas Shoal and Sabina Shoal have been the focus of China’s recent assertiveness. The Philippines’ resupply missions to the grounded ship, BRP Sierra Madre, have been repeatedly disrupted by China and have become a point of contention. China aims to drive a wedge between the U.S. and its treaty partners in East Asia. Chinese Coast Guard ships are considerably heavier and larger in terms of tonnage compared with Coast Guard vessels of other countries. For example, the Chinese vessel CCG 5901 (541 feet long and displaces 12,000 tons) is three times larger than the main ships of the U.S. Coast Guard. Hence, China’s frequent ramming of the Philippines’ vessels is dangerous and risky. There is a chance of miscalculation.

In July, China conducted naval exercises with Russia in the South China Seato demonstrate the support that it enjoys over it while projecting its claims. China’s claims in the South China Sea lack a legal basis, according to a permanent court of arbitration ruling in 2016. However, China has rejected that ruling.

### What has been the response from regional countries?

The regional countries have responded in three ways: First, they are building their defence capabilities. Defence spending has increased across the Indo-Pacific with regional countries trying to catch up with China. For example, by 2027, **Japan** wants to double its defence expenditure. The Philippines too is ramping up its defence capabilities and, among others, has acquired the anti-ship, BrahMos missiles from India.

Second, regional countries are responding to China’s activities at sea. From 2016 to 2022, Under President Rodrigo Duterte, the Philippines sought to minimise the friction between Manila and Beijing. Since 2022, the Philippines has been pushing back and publicising these incidents. The change in policy was crafted by the new President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. As a result, the frequency of incidents has gone up. Regional countries are engaged in a battle of narratives as well. They are deploying tools such as public diplomacy. The Philippines has been filming the behaviour of Chinese vessels and is releasing it through social media. The Philippines has also taken international journalists along with its resupply missions in the West Philippine Sea. The shaping of perceptions has become a key battleground.

Third, the Philippines, Japan and South Korea are treaty allies of the U.S. and are strengthening their defence relationship with it. The U.S. and the Philippines have enhanced their cooperation in the South China Seato “historic levels” and expanded cooperation in domains such as base access, training and joint exercises. They are working with Australia and Japan in “a complex multilateral maritime cooperative activity.” It is dubbed as the ‘Squad’. According to U.S. Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin, the U.S.’ commitment to the security of Japan is “ironclad” and includes the Senkaku islands as well. The U.S., Japan, and South Korea are deepening their trilateral cooperation. For the first time in history, the Defence Ministers of the three countries met in Japan in July 2024. In view of aggressive Chinese maritime activities, the press statement noted that these three countries “strongly oppose any unilateral attempts to change the status quo in the waters of the Indo-Pacific.” They also “stressed the importance of fully respecting international law including the freedom of navigation and overflight.”

Despite the efforts at bolstering the **U.S.’ alliances** in the Indo-Pacific, concerns remain about American credibility and the impact of the U.S.’ domestic politics on its external security commitments. There is also a debate about whether the U.S. engagement in East Asia balances the Chinese power or fuels conflict.

> In the last few years, maritime East Asia has become an arena for intensified power politics. The **East China Sea** borders **China, Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea**. China asserts that the **Senkaku/ Diaoyu islands**, located in the East China Sea and under Japanese control, belong to Beijing. There have been multiple crises over these islands in the past. The **South China Sea** lies between China, Taiwan and five Southeast Asian countries — Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, the Philippines, and Indonesia — and has emerged as one of the most important flashpoints in the **Indo-Pacific**. China has been aggressively pushing its claims in the South China Sea.

# L69, G4 countries seek urgent reform of UNSC

As the **United Nations (UN)** approaches its **80th anniversary** in 2025, there are renewed calls for **reform of the UN Security Council (UNSC)**, particularly from the **Group of Four (G4)** nations—**India, Brazil, Germany, and Japan**—which are seeking **permanent membership** in the Council. The G4, along with other international groupings such as the **L69 group** (representing developing countries) and the **C-10 group** (a coalition of African nations), argue that the current structure of the **UNSC** no longer reflects the geopolitical realities of the 21st century and must be reformed to enhance its **legitimacy**, **representativeness**, and **effectiveness**.

### The Current Structure of the UN Security Council

The UNSC was established in **1945** with five permanent members—**the United States, Russia, China, France, and the United Kingdom**—each holding **veto power**. This structure reflected the post-World War II balance of power. In addition, the UNSC has **10 non-permanent members**, elected for two-year terms, without veto rights. While this structure was effective in the mid-20th century, the global power dynamics have shifted significantly since then, with new emerging powers like India and Brazil playing a larger role on the world stage.

### G4’s Call for Reform

The G4 nations have long sought **permanent seats** on the UNSC to reflect their growing influence in global politics and economics. **India**, with its **1.4 billion population** and one of the world’s largest economies, has been a vocal proponent of reform, arguing that the current system is outdated. Similarly, **Brazil**, **Germany**, and **Japan**—all major economic and regional powers—are pushing for permanent representation to reflect their contributions to global security and development.

The G4 argues that the UNSC’s current structure is **unrepresentative** of the broader UN membership. Most notably, Africa and Latin America, two large and populous regions, have no permanent representation on the Council, despite their significant political, economic, and cultural contributions. The **L69 group**, composed primarily of developing countries from Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean, also supports expanding the UNSC to include more permanent members and give a stronger voice to developing nations.

### C-10 and Africa’s Role

The **C-10**, a group of African nations, has also called for a more **equitable representation** of Africa on the UNSC. Africa currently has no permanent seat, despite the continent being central to global peace and security concerns. African nations argue that they should have a greater say in decisions affecting international peace, particularly as many UNSC discussions focus on African conflicts and crises.

The **Ezulwini Consensus**, an African Union-backed proposal, demands **two permanent seats** for Africa, with full veto powers, and an increase in the number of non-permanent members. This push aligns with broader demands for democratizing global governance institutions to ensure they reflect modern geopolitical realities.

### Global Support and Resistance

While the calls for reform enjoy broad support from the **G4**, **L69**, and **C-10**, achieving consensus among the UN’s broader membership is a significant challenge. One of the key hurdles is the **veto power** held by the **P5** (the five permanent members). Any changes to the structure of the UNSC require the approval of at least two-thirds of the UN General Assembly, including all the **P5** members. **China** has been particularly resistant to reforms that would give Japan and India permanent seats, given their regional rivalries.

The **United States** and **Russia** have also been cautious about changes to the Council’s composition, particularly concerning the extension of veto powers to new members. While there is general support for expanding the number of non-permanent seats, the inclusion of new permanent members with veto power remains a contentious issue.

### The Path Forward

As the UN approaches its **80th anniversary**, the debate over **UNSC reform** will likely intensify. For the G4, the L69, and the C-10, reforming the Council is essential to maintaining its **legitimacy** and ensuring that it can effectively address contemporary global challenges. However, significant diplomatic negotiations and compromises will be required to achieve meaningful reform, particularly in overcoming resistance from current permanent members.

In the coming years, the push for a **more representative and inclusive UNSC** will remain a central issue in global governance discussions, as nations seek a Council that truly reflects the world’s current political and economic landscape.

> As the **United Nations (UN)** nears its **80th anniversary**, the **Group of Four (G4)** nations—**India, Brazil, Germany, and Japan**—are pushing for urgent **reform of the UN Security Council (UNSC)**. These nations seek **permanent membership**, arguing that the current structure, with five permanent members (P5), is outdated and does not reflect modern global power dynamics. Other groups like the **L69** (representing developing nations) and the **C-10** (African nations) also support expanding the UNSC to include more representation for **developing countries** and **Africa**, which currently lack permanent seats. 

However, resistance from the **P5**, particularly **China**, complicates the reform process, especially the issue of extending **veto powers** to new members. Achieving reform will require overcoming significant diplomatic hurdles and securing broad consensus, including approval from the P5.

# Is India’s growth story benefiting only big capital?

India’s impressive economic growth post-COVID-19, registering a remarkable **8.2% GDP growth in 2023-24**, has garnered global attention. While this growth rate makes India the fastest-growing major economy, questions remain about who benefits the most from this surge. Critics argue that the **biggest gains** have largely favored **big businesses**, while **small and medium enterprises (SMEs)** and informal sectors continue to face challenges. To assess if India’s growth is primarily benefiting big capital, we must analyze several aspects of the economy.

### Big Business and Capital-Intensive Growth

India’s recent economic growth has been significantly driven by sectors like **technology**, **automobiles**, **pharmaceuticals**, and **banking**, all of which are dominated by large corporations. **Big businesses**, such as **Reliance Industries**, **Tata Group**, and **Infosys**, have reaped substantial profits during this period, bolstered by a favorable policy environment. The Indian government’s **production-linked incentive (PLI) schemes**, aimed at boosting manufacturing in key sectors like electronics, pharmaceuticals, and semiconductors, have disproportionately benefited large firms with greater resources to invest in technology and infrastructure.

Moreover, **corporate profits** have surged in recent years, with major companies reporting record earnings, particularly in industries like **e-commerce**, **banking**, and **IT services**. These sectors are capital-intensive, and their growth has widened the gap between large corporations and smaller businesses. For instance, the **Indian stock market** has reached new highs, but this growth is primarily concentrated in a few **large-cap companies**, reflecting a growth pattern skewed toward big capital.

### The Impact on Small Businesses and the Informal Sector

While big businesses thrive, **small and medium enterprises (SMEs)** and the **informal sector** have struggled to recover from the impacts of the pandemic. SMEs, which account for a significant portion of employment in India, continue to face **credit constraints**, **rising costs**, and **lower demand**. According to reports, a substantial number of small businesses closed during the pandemic, and many are still grappling with financial instability, unable to compete with larger corporations that have easier access to capital and government incentives.

Additionally, the **informal sector**, which employs around **80-90% of India’s workforce**, has not fully recovered from the pandemic-induced disruptions. Wage growth in the informal economy remains stagnant, and many workers face job insecurity. The structural shift toward **formalization** and **digitalization**—while necessary for long-term economic health—has further marginalized workers in sectors like agriculture, construction, and small-scale manufacturing, which rely on traditional methods and informal labor arrangements.

### Inequality and Wealth Concentration

The rise of **inequality** has become a key concern. India's **Gini coefficient**, a measure of income inequality, has worsened in recent years. Reports show that the **top 1% of earners** hold a significant share of the country’s wealth, highlighting the growing wealth gap. While big businesses and wealthy individuals benefit from policies designed to spur growth, the majority of the population, especially in rural and semi-urban areas, faces **unequal access** to economic opportunities.

### Government Initiatives and Efforts

The Indian government has launched several initiatives to bridge this gap, including the **Atmanirbhar Bharat (Self-Reliant India)** mission and **PM SVANidhi** schemes, aimed at supporting small businesses, street vendors, and informal workers. However, the effectiveness of these programs remains a subject of debate. Many critics argue that the implementation of these schemes has been slow and their impact limited, especially in rural areas where informal employment is dominant.

### Conclusion

India’s recent economic growth has certainly benefited **big capital**, with large corporations playing a dominant role in driving the country's GDP growth. However, this growth has not been **inclusive**, as small businesses, the informal sector, and lower-income groups continue to face significant challenges. For India’s growth to be sustainable and equitable, there is a need for **inclusive policies** that specifically target the **SME sector**, promote **formal employment**, and ensure that economic gains are more widely distributed across all sections of society. Without such interventions, the growth story may continue to benefit primarily big capital while exacerbating **income inequality**.

> India's economic growth, particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic, has primarily benefited **big businesses**, with the country's **8.2% GDP growth in 2023-24** led by sectors like technology, pharmaceuticals, and banking, which are dominated by large corporations. Government policies, such as the **production-linked incentive (PLI) schemes**, have further bolstered big capital, but **small and medium enterprises (SMEs)** and the **informal sector**—which account for a large portion of employment—are still struggling with **credit constraints** and **low demand**. Inequality has worsened, with the **top 1% of earners** controlling much of the wealth. For more equitable growth, policies need to target the **SME sector** and informal workers.

# An opportunity to rethink India’s pension system

The pension system in India has evolved significantly over the years, moving from a **welfare-oriented** model to a **market-linked** one. The key phases of this evolution are marked by three major schemes: the **Old Pension Scheme (OPS)**, the **New Pension Scheme (NPS)**, and the proposed **Unified Pension Scheme (UPS)**. Each scheme reflects different government approaches to social security for retirees, each with its advantages and challenges.

### 1. **Old Pension Scheme (OPS)**

The **Old Pension Scheme (OPS)** was the traditional model followed by the Indian government, primarily for its employees. Under this scheme, retirees received a fixed pension calculated as a percentage of their last drawn salary, with the government bearing the entire financial responsibility. The scheme was **defined benefit-based**, meaning the retirees were assured of a stable income, unaffected by market fluctuations. This made the OPS particularly **secure** for government employees, ensuring financial security post-retirement.

However, the OPS had some downsides. It placed a **significant burden on the government** in terms of budget allocation, especially as the number of government employees increased. The growing pension liability, coupled with rising life expectancy, made the OPS financially unsustainable in the long term. Critics argued that it created an unequal system, as government employees enjoyed secure pensions, while those in the private sector lacked similar safety nets.

### 2. **New Pension Scheme (NPS)**

In response to the financial sustainability concerns posed by the OPS, the government introduced the **New Pension Scheme (NPS)** in **2004**. Unlike OPS, the NPS is a **defined contribution-based** system where both the employee and the government (for government employees) contribute to the pension fund. The fund is managed by **private fund managers** who invest in market-linked assets like stocks and bonds. Upon retirement, employees can withdraw a part of their accumulated funds as a lump sum, while the rest must be used to purchase an annuity, which guarantees a regular income.

The major advantage of the NPS is its **reduced burden on the government**, as the pension payout depends on the contributions and the returns generated from market investments. However, this also makes the NPS less predictable and secure for retirees, as their pension is **subject to market risks**. The **volatility** of financial markets means that retirees may not be guaranteed a stable income, which has led to discontent, particularly among government employees who were accustomed to the stability of the OPS.

### 3. **Unified Pension Scheme (UPS)**

The proposed **Unified Pension Scheme (UPS)** aims to address some of the shortcomings of both the OPS and NPS, providing a middle ground. The government envisions a system where contributions continue, but there is **greater predictability** in retirement benefits compared to the NPS. The UPS would likely incorporate features of both schemes, aiming to ensure **sustainability** for the government while providing **security** for retirees. However, the **details** of the UPS are still under consideration, and much will depend on how the government balances fiscal responsibility with the welfare of retirees.

### 4. **Current Debate on Pension Reform**

The growing debate around pension systems in India is part of a larger global shift away from **neoliberal policies** toward a more **welfare-oriented** approach. As the world grapples with economic uncertainties, rising inequality, and longer life expectancy, there is renewed focus on **social security** measures. Critics of the NPS argue that relying on **market-linked returns** is not ideal for something as critical as retirement security, especially for lower-income employees who cannot afford market volatility. This is why there are calls for reforms to ensure that retirees, especially those who have worked in public service, receive **adequate and predictable pensions**.

The proposed **Unified Pension Scheme (UPS)** will need to address these concerns, offering a **more secure retirement** while also keeping the government’s fiscal health in check. Rectifying its structure to avoid the pitfalls of both the OPS and NPS will be key to ensuring that it serves the interests of retirees effectively.

### Conclusion

India's pension system has transitioned from the **secure but financially burdensome OPS** to the **market-linked NPS**, and now to the proposed **Unified Pension Scheme (UPS)**. While the NPS has alleviated fiscal stress on the government, it has exposed retirees to market risks, sparking a debate about the need for a more **stable and predictable pension system**. As the government explores the details of the UPS, it must strike a balance between **financial sustainability** and the **welfare** of its retired employees to create a fair and reliable pension system for the future.

> India's pension system has undergone significant changes, moving from the **Old Pension Scheme (OPS)** to the **New Pension Scheme (NPS)** and now considering the **Unified Pension Scheme (UPS)**. The **OPS** provided government employees with secure, defined-benefit pensions but was financially unsustainable due to rising liabilities. The **NPS**, introduced in 2004, shifted to a market-linked, defined-contribution model, reducing the government's financial burden but exposing retirees to market volatility. The proposed **UPS** aims to balance sustainability and security by ensuring more predictable benefits while managing fiscal concerns. The ongoing debate highlights a shift toward more **welfare-oriented** policies, with reforms needed to protect retirees' interests effectively.

# Constitution has thrived over the years as a living document, says CJI

Chief Justice of India (CJI) **D.Y. Chandrachud** recently emphasized the dynamic nature of constitutional doctrine, highlighting how it evolves alongside society. Speaking on Thursday, he pointed out that no generation, including the current one, holds a monopoly over constitutional solutions or the foresight to predict the future. His remarks underline the **flexibility** and **adaptability** of constitutional interpretation in the face of changing social, political, and economic contexts.

### Evolution of Constitutional Doctrine

Justice Chandrachud’s statement reinforces the idea that the **Constitution** is a living document, designed to evolve with the needs and aspirations of society. The Constitution’s **interpretation** cannot remain static, as it must address contemporary challenges while staying true to its core principles of **justice, equality, and liberty**. Over time, constitutional courts have played a crucial role in adapting legal doctrines to reflect **social progress** and **changing values**.

For example, landmark rulings like **Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973)**, which introduced the doctrine of **basic structure**, ensured that no part of the Constitution, even through amendments, could undermine its fundamental ethos. This doctrine itself was a product of evolving judicial interpretation, designed to protect the Constitution’s core values against potential misuse by future generations.

Similarly, decisions on **privacy** (Puttaswamy judgment), **gender equality**, and **LGBTQ+ rights** show how the Supreme Court has gradually expanded constitutional protections to include contemporary social issues. These examples illustrate how constitutional doctrine adapts to meet new challenges, as CJI Chandrachud suggested.

### No Generation’s Monopoly Over Solutions

Justice Chandrachud also emphasized that no generation can claim exclusive rights over solutions to societal problems. This highlights the role of **judicial humility** and **foresight**, recognizing that current interpretations may not always foresee the complexities of future societal challenges. For example, when framing the Indian Constitution, the founders could not have anticipated the rapid technological advancements and their implications for **privacy**, **surveillance**, and **data security**. It was left to future courts to interpret constitutional provisions in light of these new developments.

This dynamic nature is evident in **social justice movements** and changing attitudes toward **individual rights**. For instance, past judicial decisions did not fully recognize the rights of the LGBTQ+ community or acknowledge the privacy concerns raised by digital surveillance, which have since become central to judicial discourse.

### The Judiciary’s Role in Social Change

CJI Chandrachud’s remarks underscore the judiciary’s essential role in shaping constitutional doctrine through **progressive interpretations** that respond to social change. Courts are often seen as **guardians of the Constitution**, ensuring that laws and policies remain aligned with the **values** and **principles** enshrined in the document. The courts have the delicate task of balancing **tradition** with **modernity**, safeguarding fundamental rights while adapting legal interpretations to meet emerging societal needs.

### Conclusion

Justice D.Y. Chandrachud's assertion that constitutional doctrine evolves with society, and that no generation can claim a monopoly on solutions, reflects the importance of judicial flexibility. His message resonates with the idea that the **Constitution** must adapt to new realities while maintaining its commitment to core values like **justice**, **equality**, and **liberty**. By embracing change, the judiciary ensures that the Constitution remains relevant and responsive to future challenges, continuing to serve as a bulwark for democracy and individual rights.

> Chief Justice of India (CJI) **D.Y. Chandrachud** emphasized that constitutional doctrine must evolve in tandem with societal changes. He stated that no generation, including the present, holds a monopoly over constitutional solutions or the foresight to predict future challenges. His remarks highlight the **dynamic nature of the Constitution**, which must be interpreted flexibly to address contemporary issues while upholding its core values of **justice, equality, and liberty**. Judicial decisions over the years—such as rulings on **privacy**, **LGBTQ+ rights**, and **gender equality**—illustrate how courts have adapted constitutional principles to reflect changing social contexts. CJI Chandrachud's statement underscores the importance of judicial **humility** and openness to evolving interpretations in safeguarding the Constitution’s relevance for future generations.
