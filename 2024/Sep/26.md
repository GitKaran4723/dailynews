# The misplaced move of ‘one nation one election’

The idea of **‘One Nation, One Election’**, which advocates holding simultaneous elections for the **Lok Sabha**, **State Assemblies**, and **local bodies**, was proposed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi a few years ago. The concept aims to address the frequent electoral cycles that occur across the country, as local body and state elections are held in different states at various times. This requires politicians, especially the Prime Minister and other senior leaders, to spend significant time on the campaign trail, often diverting their attention from governance. The strain this places on resources and the constant election campaigning may have been a key factor in the emergence of this idea.

### Formation of a High-Level Committee

To explore the feasibility and implications of this idea, a **high-level committee** was set up under the chairmanship of **former President Ram Nath Kovind**. The committee comprised prominent figures such as **Home Minister Amit Shah**, **former Leader of the Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad**, **former Chairman of the Fifteenth Finance Commission N.K. Singh**, **former Lok Sabha Secretary-General Subhash C. Kashyap**, **senior advocate Harish Salve**, and **former Chief Vigilance Commissioner Sanjay Kothari**. Additionally, **Minister of State for Law and Justice Arjun Ram Meghwal** was a special invitee to the discussions.

### The Concept of Simultaneous Elections

The idea of holding elections simultaneously across the country is not new. India held simultaneous elections for the Lok Sabha and State Assemblies from 1952 to 1967. However, this practice ended after several State Assemblies were dissolved prematurely, and as a result, their electoral cycles became out of sync with the Lok Sabha elections.

The rationale behind the concept of **‘One Nation, One Election’** is primarily to save time and resources. Frequent elections require significant expenditure on campaign logistics, security arrangements, and manpower deployment. Holding elections simultaneously could reduce these costs and allow the government and political parties to focus on governance rather than being in perpetual election mode. Furthermore, it could minimize the disruption caused by the Model Code of Conduct (MCC), which limits the government’s ability to announce new policies or programs during election periods.

### Criticisms of the Proposal

However, the idea of simultaneous elections faces several challenges, both practical and constitutional. **P.D.T. Achary**, former Secretary-General of the **Lok Sabha**, critiques this move, arguing that it is **misplaced** for several reasons:

1. **Federalism Concerns**: India is a federal democracy with both the Union and State governments operating within their respective jurisdictions. Holding simultaneous elections could undermine the autonomy of states. Elections in India are not just about national issues; they often reflect regional aspirations, governance, and issues specific to a state or local body. Combining national and state elections could shift focus towards national issues, overshadowing regional concerns and affecting voter behavior.

2. **Disrupting Constitutional Provisions**: The Indian Constitution provides for separate terms for the **Lok Sabha**, **State Assemblies**, and **local bodies**. Synchronizing these elections would require significant amendments to the Constitution. If an Assembly or the Lok Sabha is dissolved prematurely, it would either require immediate elections, breaking the synchronized cycle, or necessitate a mechanism to govern during the interim period, potentially through President’s Rule. Both options raise serious constitutional and democratic concerns.

3. **Logistical Challenges**: India’s elections are a massive logistical exercise, involving millions of voters, security personnel, and election officials. Holding elections simultaneously across the entire country would require unprecedented coordination and resources. The Election Commission of India (ECI) would need to ensure that sufficient electronic voting machines (EVMs), ballot units, and security arrangements are in place, adding to the complexity of the process.

4. **Voter Confusion**: Simultaneous elections could lead to voter confusion. National, state, and local issues are distinct, and holding elections for all levels at the same time could blur these distinctions. Voters might prioritize national parties or issues over local ones, affecting the outcome of elections in ways that do not fully reflect local preferences.

### Conclusion

While the idea of **‘One Nation, One Election’** might offer certain efficiencies in terms of cost and time, it raises serious concerns regarding India’s federal structure, constitutional provisions, and democratic processes. The challenges of implementing such a system, particularly the potential undermining of state-specific issues and logistical difficulties, suggest that the idea, while appealing in theory, may not be feasible or desirable in practice.

# China’s warning shots with minerals that run the world

On **August 15, 2024**, China announced its decision to **restrict the export of antimony**, a critical mineral essential for various strategic sectors, including defense and military applications. Antimony is used in the manufacturing of military equipment such as **missiles, infrared sensors, flares, ammunition**, and even **nuclear weapons**. The **Chinese Ministry of Commerce** cited **national security** concerns as the primary reason for this export restriction, with the policy taking effect from **September 15, 2024**. This move, however, is seen as part of a broader geopolitical strategy that China has been adopting, particularly since **August 2023**, when it initiated a series of **countermeasures** in response to global events, especially increasing tensions with Western countries.

### Importance of Antimony

**Antimony** is a crucial mineral with applications beyond the defense sector. It is used in the **electronics**, **automotive**, and **chemical industries**, serving as a flame retardant and in the production of semiconductors, batteries, and other electronic components. Its versatility makes it a highly sought-after resource in industries critical to modern economies. Antimony’s significance in defense and other high-tech industries puts it in the category of **critical minerals**, the supply of which is closely monitored by global powers.

China controls a significant portion of the world’s antimony reserves and production, positioning it as a key player in the global supply of this mineral. According to recent data, China accounts for over **60% of global antimony production**, making the country’s decisions about its export policies highly consequential for the global supply chain. The restriction on exports could have far-reaching effects on countries that depend on this mineral for strategic purposes.
When it comes to critical minerals, China is not only a stakeholder but also a leader. It dominates every supply chain segment — upstream, midstream, and downstream, covering mining, extraction, refining and processing. It enjoys a near-monopoly status, controlling 60% of rare earth production, 60% of critical minerals production and 80% of the processing worldwide. Therefore, any decision China makes has profound national security implications globally. The European Union and countries such as India, Japan and the United States are strategically vulnerable due to their dependence on critical minerals.


### Geopolitical Context

China’s decision to restrict antimony exports is part of a broader trend of **resource nationalism**, where countries limit the export of critical resources to preserve them for domestic use or to gain strategic leverage in global markets. The justification of “national security” is a commonly used rationale in such scenarios. The move comes at a time when **geopolitical tensions between China and Western countries**—particularly the United States—have been escalating due to issues such as trade disputes, technological rivalry, and military build-ups in the Indo-Pacific region.

In August 2023, China began implementing a series of countermeasures aimed at curbing the export of certain high-tech materials, such as **gallium** and **germanium**, in response to Western sanctions and restrictions on the export of advanced technologies to China. These minerals, like antimony, are critical for producing semiconductors, electronics, and defense equipment. By restricting their export, China is signaling its intention to exert leverage in global supply chains and influence the geopolitical landscape.

### Impact on Global Markets

China's restriction on antimony exports is expected to cause disruptions in global supply chains, particularly for countries and industries reliant on the mineral for defense and technological applications. The immediate impact will likely be seen in the **defense sectors** of countries such as the **United States, European Union**, and **Japan**, which depend on antimony for the production of military equipment. With a sudden reduction in supply, these nations may face challenges in maintaining the production of key defense technologies.

Industries beyond defense, such as **electronics and automotive**, will also feel the effects of these export restrictions. As antimony is a critical component in **batteries** and **flame retardants**, the supply crunch may lead to price hikes and shortages in these sectors. Companies that rely on antimony will need to explore alternative sources or substitute materials, which may prove challenging given China’s dominance in the market.
Restricting access to strategic resources is a classic statecraft strategy, hitting the enemy’s weak points, an example being the U.S. oil embargo against Japan in 1940. Therefore, this is expected from an aspiring great power such as China, which seeks to leverage its status as a mineral power. The difference in China’s case is that this initially started as an act to intimidate countries. However, with recent countermoves, critical minerals export controls have now become a part of China’s foreign policy objectives. It has moved from the politicisation to the weaponisation stage. For two reasons, China has grown more comfortable using its mineral resources as a political tool. First, Beijing is reminding the West of its strategic dependency on China by demonstrating its status as a mineral power and exerting control over the supply chain. Second, China is responding in like and believes that it is acceptable to take advantage of the situation to sabotage the West’s critical mineral supply chain, which will hinder the development of its high-tech sectors and undermine their efforts to decouple and de-risk. Those critical minerals utilised in dual-use applications are major targets in particular as they are needed in the building of the Virginia class submarine and the F-35 fighter aircraft, which require several hundred pounds of rare earth elements. This shows that the aggressive, reciprocal and coercive approach has taken over the cooperative and collaborative approach, one of China’s two schools of thought.

### Strategic Implications

The restriction on antimony exports is not only an economic decision but also a **strategic geopolitical move**. By curbing the supply of a mineral critical to various industries, China is sending a clear signal that it is willing to leverage its control over critical resources to counter external pressures, particularly from Western countries. This move highlights the importance of securing supply chains for critical minerals, a challenge that many countries, including the U.S. and EU, have already started addressing by diversifying supply sources and increasing domestic production capabilities.

### India's vulnerability
Like its Quad partners, Australia, Japan and the U.S., India remains vulnerable due to its strategic dependence on China. New Delhi is heavily dependent on the imports of critical minerals such as lithium, nickel, cobalt and copper, which resulted in an import cost of around ₹34,000 crore in FY23. It is estimated that India’s hunger for minerals will only grow, and so will the import cost, further increasing India’s vulnerability. Hence, this episode must act as a wake-up call for India and the policymakers who have been slow in taking precautionary measures such as having partnerships with like-minded countries and investing in developing alternative supply chains.

### Conclusion

China’s decision to restrict **antimony exports** marks another significant step in the ongoing geopolitical competition over critical resources. As the world becomes increasingly reliant on advanced technologies and defense systems that depend on such minerals, control over their supply will continue to play a pivotal role in global power dynamics. This move underscores the need for countries to reduce their dependence on Chinese resources by developing alternative supply chains, securing domestic sources, and fostering international cooperation in the mining and distribution of critical minerals.

> On **August 15, 2024**, China announced export restrictions on **antimony**, a critical mineral used in defense and technology sectors, citing **national security** concerns. The restriction, effective from **September 15**, is part of China's broader strategy of controlling crucial resources in response to geopolitical tensions with the West. Antimony, vital for manufacturing **missiles, sensors, ammunition**, and **electronics**, is largely produced in China, which dominates global supply. This move is expected to disrupt global supply chains, especially in defense, electronics, and automotive industries, and underscores the need for countries to diversify their sources of **critical minerals** to reduce reliance on China.

# Taking stock of global nuclear disarmament

On **September 26**, the United Nations marks the **International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons**, a day dedicated to promoting global efforts toward nuclear disarmament. This year’s **UN General Assembly** session will include discussions on the **Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW)**, also known as the **Ban Treaty**, which is distinct from the more widely known **Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)**. The focus of the discussions will be to evaluate the progress of the TPNW and its goals in a time of significant geopolitical divisions, with nuclear threats continuing to loom over many of these conflicts.

### The TPNW and the NPT: Two Different Approaches

The **TPNW**, which entered into force in **January 2021**, is the first legally binding international agreement that comprehensively bans nuclear weapons. Its ultimate goal is the complete elimination of nuclear arsenals. This treaty was adopted by 122 countries at the UN General Assembly in 2017, but it has not been signed or ratified by the nuclear-armed states, including the United States, Russia, China, India, and others, who argue that it disregards the complex security realities of the nuclear-armed world. These nations instead adhere to the **NPT**, which was established in 1970 and is built on a framework of **non-proliferation**, **disarmament**, and the **right to peaceful use of nuclear energy**. While the NPT seeks to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and calls for eventual disarmament, it allows nuclear-armed states to retain their arsenals under a promise of eventual disarmament — a promise that many feel has not been fulfilled in the past 50 years.

### The Global Divide and its Impact on Nuclear Policy

The backdrop to the General Assembly’s discussions on the TPNW includes intense divisions over several global conflicts, particularly the **war in Ukraine** and the **Israel-Palestine conflict**. These disputes have strained international diplomacy, making the issue of nuclear disarmament more complex. Nuclear weapons have become entangled in these conflicts, whether in the form of direct threats, such as those emanating from Russia in the context of the Ukraine war, or implicit threats linked to regional tensions.

Nuclear-armed states often justify their possession of nuclear weapons as necessary for their national security, particularly when regional conflicts or rivalries remain unresolved. As a result, the refusal by these countries — including **India**, which has stayed out of the TPNW — to engage with the treaty significantly limits its global impact. However, the TPNW’s supporters argue that the possession and potential use of nuclear weapons only heighten these threats, rather than providing security.

### India’s Role and the Response of Non-Signatories

India’s stance, like other nuclear-armed states, reflects its security concerns. Given its regional security dynamics with neighboring **Pakistan** (also a nuclear-armed state) and China, India’s approach to nuclear disarmament is cautious. India supports **nuclear non-proliferation** but insists that global disarmament must be achieved through a step-by-step process, one that includes all nuclear-armed states and addresses underlying security concerns.

How countries like India respond to the ongoing UN discussions about the **Ban Treaty** will have a significant impact on its future. If nuclear-armed states continue to stay out of the TPNW, the treaty’s ability to achieve global nuclear disarmament will remain limited. However, if these countries engage in dialogue and acknowledge the efforts of the TPNW’s supporters, even without formal adherence to the treaty, it could help strengthen the global movement toward eliminating nuclear weapons.

### Challenges and Opportunities for the TPNW

The road to **total nuclear disarmament** faces several obstacles. Firstly, the continued modernization of nuclear arsenals by major powers such as the **U.S.**, **Russia**, and **China** complicates efforts to move toward disarmament. Moreover, the lack of engagement from nuclear-armed states undermines the TPNW’s goal of creating a world free from nuclear weapons.

On the other hand, there are opportunities for progress. The growing support for the TPNW, especially from non-nuclear states and civil society organizations, underscores a global desire for disarmament. The treaty’s framework can serve as a moral and legal pressure point, encouraging incremental steps toward disarmament even in the face of resistance from nuclear-armed powers.

### Conclusion

As the UN General Assembly takes stock of the **Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW)**, the global community stands at a crossroads. The treaty represents a bold vision for a world free from nuclear weapons, but its success depends on whether nuclear-armed states choose to engage or undermine its progress. Countries like India, which have stayed out of the TPNW, have a pivotal role in shaping the future of global disarmament. Their willingness to participate in constructive dialogue could help strengthen the international movement toward the total elimination of nuclear weapons, or their continued refusal could allow nuclear threats to persist and grow.

> The UN's **International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons** on **September 26** brings focus to the **Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW)**, distinct from the **Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)**. While the TPNW seeks total nuclear disarmament, nuclear-armed states like India, China, and the U.S. have not joined, citing security concerns. Ongoing global conflicts, such as the war in Ukraine, complicate efforts toward disarmament. How non-signatory nations like India engage with TPNW discussions will significantly impact the treaty's future. Support could advance nuclear disarmament, while continued resistance may further entrench nuclear weapons.

# Government mulls over sending Jaishankar for SCO meet in Pakistan

As the Indian government considers the potential visit of **External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar** to **Pakistan** for the upcoming **Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Heads of Government meeting**, diplomatic experts and former High Commissioners have weighed in on the significance of India’s participation. The meeting is set to take place next month, and while **India-Pakistan bilateral relations** remain fraught with tensions, there is a growing consensus among diplomats that India should separate the failures of its bilateral relationship with Pakistan from the broader strategic and geopolitical value of the **SCO**, an influential regional grouping that includes **10 Eurasian countries**, such as **Russia** and **China**.

### Importance of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)

The **SCO** was founded in 2001 as a Eurasian political, economic, and security alliance, aimed at fostering mutual trust and cooperation among member states. Originally comprising **China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan**, the grouping expanded in 2017 to include **India and Pakistan** as full members. Its focus includes **regional security**, **counterterrorism**, **economic cooperation**, and **cultural exchanges**. Given the global and regional power dynamics, particularly with the involvement of China and Russia, the SCO provides a platform for India to engage with important global players on matters of mutual interest.

In recent years, the SCO has also emerged as a forum for discussing **Afghanistan** and **Central Asian stability**, which are critical for India's regional security interests. Therefore, India's participation in the SCO is seen as crucial to maintaining its influence in the region and asserting its presence in dialogues that shape the Eurasian political landscape. Former Indian High Commissioners, speaking to *The Hindu*, emphasized that the strategic value of the SCO transcends bilateral tensions with Pakistan and should not be undermined by the difficulties in India-Pakistan relations.

### Balancing Bilateral Relations with Multilateral Engagement

The potential participation of S. Jaishankar in the **SCO Heads of Government meeting** in Pakistan comes amid long-standing strains in **India-Pakistan relations**, especially in the wake of the **2019 Pulwama attack** and the subsequent **Balakot airstrike**. Bilateral ties remain largely frozen, with India maintaining that there will be no significant diplomatic engagement with Pakistan unless cross-border terrorism is addressed. Despite this, former diplomats argue that India must approach the SCO with a pragmatic outlook, separating bilateral issues from multilateral opportunities.

Former High Commissioners point out that the **SCO platform** allows India to engage with **Russia**, **China**, and **Central Asian** nations on critical regional issues, such as security cooperation, terrorism, and economic partnerships, without being overshadowed by the troubled India-Pakistan relationship. They assert that boycotting the meeting could send the wrong signal, not just to Pakistan but to other important SCO members, like Russia and China, who value India’s involvement in regional affairs.

Moreover, India's growing strategic interests in **Central Asia**, particularly regarding energy security, connectivity projects (such as the **International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC)**), and **counterterrorism cooperation**, make it essential for India to maintain a proactive role within the SCO. Engagement in multilateral forums also allows India to showcase its global leadership aspirations, aligning with its broader foreign policy goals of maintaining strong regional and international partnerships.

### Navigating Complex Relations

India’s participation in multilateral forums like the SCO often requires delicate diplomatic balancing. While the **SCO Heads of Government meeting** is likely to bring Indian and Pakistani leaders together in the same forum, it does not necessarily imply a thaw in bilateral ties. Historically, India has participated in similar SCO meetings hosted by Pakistan without engaging in direct talks, maintaining the position that multilateral forums do not change the dynamics of bilateral diplomacy.

However, diplomatic experts suggest that India should utilize the opportunity to assert its stand on global issues, particularly in a forum where **China** and **Russia** hold significant sway. At the same time, India’s participation would signal its willingness to engage in regional cooperation while sticking to its firm stance on terrorism-related issues with Pakistan.

### Conclusion

As India considers sending **External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar** to Pakistan for the **SCO Heads of Government meeting**, the stakes are high. Participation in the SCO meeting offers India an opportunity to engage with regional powers like Russia and China, advance its strategic interests in Central Asia, and address regional security issues without being constrained by the challenges of bilateral relations with Pakistan. Former diplomats have emphasized that the **SCO’s strategic importance** should not be overshadowed by India-Pakistan tensions and that India's engagement at such multilateral platforms is crucial to its broader regional and global diplomatic goals.

> India is considering sending **External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar** to Pakistan for the **Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Heads of Government meeting** next month. Despite strained **India-Pakistan relations**, former Indian High Commissioners emphasize the importance of separating bilateral tensions from the strategic value of the SCO. The SCO includes **10 Eurasian countries** such as **Russia**, **China**, and **Central Asian** nations, making it a vital platform for India to engage on issues like **regional security**, **counterterrorism**, and **economic cooperation**. Participating in the SCO meeting allows India to maintain influence in the region and advance its broader strategic and diplomatic interests, despite ongoing tensions with Pakistan.

# How global warming affects forecasting

The years **2023-2024** have set record temperatures, offering a stark preview of the effects of **global warming**. From **deadly heatwaves** to **devastating cyclones, floods, droughts**, and **wildfires**, the wide range of climate extremes being witnessed globally is a reminder of the urgent need to address climate change. These events are not isolated but part of a broader, more complex pattern of environmental disturbances, many of which can be attributed to the earth’s warming.

### Crossing the 1.5ºC Threshold

According to some estimates, the world may have already crossed the **1.5ºC warming threshold**, meaning that the earth’s average surface temperature has increased by more than **1.5ºC** over the **pre-industrial average**. This threshold is particularly important because it represents a critical limit highlighted in the **Paris Agreement**, signed by almost 200 nations in 2015, which aims to limit global temperature rise to **well below 2ºC** and preferably **1.5ºC** above pre-industrial levels. The **Alliance of Small Island Developing States (AOSIS)**, whose members are particularly vulnerable to sea-level rise and extreme weather, has long advocated for the **1.5ºC limit** as the upper boundary of manageable global warming.

While **1.5ºC** is a symbolic threshold, it is based on climate models predicting that surpassing it would lead to severe and potentially irreversible impacts on ecosystems, economies, and human health. However, there remains some uncertainty about how long the earth’s temperature needs to stay above this level for these catastrophic outcomes to materialize. The current **global temperatures** are estimates derived from a combination of **data** and **climate models**, meaning real-time monitoring and long-term trends will be crucial for understanding the duration and consequences of these temperature rises.

### Extreme Weather and Global Warming

The record warming of 2023-2024 has intensified the occurrence of extreme weather events. For example, **heatwaves** have become more frequent and severe, with many parts of the world experiencing dangerously high temperatures that have led to widespread health crises and fatalities. The warming atmosphere can also hold more moisture, increasing the intensity of **cyclones** and **flooding**, as seen in several regions. Simultaneously, prolonged **droughts** have led to **wildfires**, devastating ecosystems and agricultural production.

These extremes are not just random fluctuations; they are part of a global pattern that scientists have long predicted would result from **global warming**. As the planet warms, climate systems become destabilized, leading to a more chaotic and unpredictable environment. The **IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change)** has consistently warned that higher temperatures will lead to increased **climate volatility**, manifesting in more frequent and severe weather events.

### Predicting Future Impacts

The question now is not whether global warming will lead to environmental disturbances but **when** and **how severe** these impacts will be. Scientists have developed models that attempt to predict what might happen once global temperatures remain consistently above **1.5ºC**, but there are uncertainties about the timing and severity of these impacts. For example, we do not yet fully understand how long temperatures must remain elevated before certain feedback loops—such as the melting of ice sheets, the thawing of permafrost, or the collapse of ecosystems—become irreversible.

These feedback loops could accelerate warming even further, potentially leading to a **runaway climate change scenario**, where the effects compound themselves. For instance, **melting ice** reduces the earth’s **albedo** (its ability to reflect sunlight), causing the planet to absorb more heat, while the thawing of permafrost releases stored carbon dioxide and methane, which further intensify warming. Such feedback mechanisms are central to understanding the long-term consequences of crossing the **1.5ºC threshold**.

### The Path Forward

While crossing the **1.5ºC limit** is a significant warning sign, it does not mean that all is lost. Immediate and aggressive action to reduce **greenhouse gas emissions** could still limit further temperature increases and mitigate the worst effects of climate change. This requires global cooperation and strong political will, especially from major emitters such as the **United States**, **China**, and the **European Union**.

In parallel, countries must also invest in **adaptation strategies** to cope with the impacts of climate change that are already inevitable. These include building **resilient infrastructure**, implementing **disaster preparedness plans**, and developing sustainable agricultural practices to withstand extreme weather.

### Conclusion

The record warming of **2023-2024** serves as a critical indicator of the accelerating pace of **climate change**. The crossing of the **1.5ºC threshold** raises the specter of more frequent and severe environmental disturbances, including **heatwaves, cyclones, droughts,** and **wildfires**. While uncertainties remain about how long the warming must persist to trigger irreversible damage, it is clear that urgent action is required to mitigate these impacts. The future of global warming will depend on how quickly and decisively the world responds to the climate crisis.

> The record warming of **2023-2024** highlights the accelerating effects of **global warming**, marked by extreme weather events such as **heatwaves, cyclones, droughts, floods**, and **wildfires**. Estimates suggest that the world may have crossed the **1.5ºC warming threshold** above pre-industrial levels, a critical limit for preventing severe environmental impacts. This threshold is symbolic, but uncertainties remain about how long temperatures must stay elevated for catastrophic effects to manifest. Scientists warn that prolonged warming could trigger **irreversible feedback loops**, worsening climate conditions. Urgent action to reduce **greenhouse gas emissions** and invest in **adaptation strategies** is essential to mitigate the impacts of climate change.

# 10 Years of Make in India

**Make in India** is one of the most prominent initiatives launched by the Government of India under Prime Minister **Narendra Modi** in **September 2014**. The goal of the program is to transform India into a global manufacturing hub by encouraging both **domestic and international companies** to manufacture their products in India. As it completes 10 years in 2024, **Make in India** has significantly impacted the Indian economy, although it has faced challenges as well.

### **Key Objectives and Vision**

The primary aim of **Make in India** was to increase the share of manufacturing in India’s **Gross Domestic Product (GDP)** from around 16-17% to **25% by 2025**. The initiative also aimed to create **100 million additional jobs** in the manufacturing sector by 2022. The overarching vision was to make India a competitive manufacturing destination by improving infrastructure, reducing regulatory bottlenecks, and fostering innovation and skills development in various sectors.

### **Sectors Covered**

The initiative targeted **25 key sectors**, including **automobiles, aviation, biotechnology, defense manufacturing, chemicals, electronics, textiles, pharmaceuticals**, and **renewable energy**. These sectors were chosen due to their potential to generate employment, attract investment, and spur economic growth.

### **Achievements in 10 Years**

1. **Increased FDI**: One of the significant successes of **Make in India** has been its ability to attract **Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)**. Between **2014 and 2022**, India saw a steady rise in FDI inflows, reaching an all-time high of **$83.57 billion in FY2021-22**. Several global companies like **Apple, Foxconn, and Samsung** have expanded their manufacturing facilities in India, particularly in the **electronics and mobile manufacturing sector**.

2. **Job Creation and Growth of MSMEs**: The **Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSME)** sector, which employs a significant portion of India’s workforce, has benefited from the **Make in India** initiative. By promoting local production and reducing reliance on imports, the initiative has supported job creation in rural and semi-urban areas, although not at the scale originally envisioned.

3. **Improvement in Ease of Doing Business**: India’s position in the **World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Index** has improved dramatically. India climbed from **142nd in 2014** to **63rd in 2020**, largely due to reforms in starting a business, dealing with construction permits, and trading across borders.

4. **Defense Manufacturing**: One of the crucial sectors of **Make in India** has been **defense manufacturing**. India has been pushing for **self-reliance** in defense production. The government has opened up the defense sector to **100% FDI**, and several defense products are now being manufactured locally.

5. **Electronics Manufacturing**: The **electronics and mobile manufacturing** sector has witnessed substantial growth. India has become the world’s second-largest manufacturer of mobile phones, with global brands like **Apple** and **Xiaomi** setting up assembly plants.

### **Challenges Faced**

1. **Slow Growth in Manufacturing Share**: Despite its successes, **Make in India** has faced challenges in meeting its primary goal of increasing the manufacturing share in GDP. By 2022, manufacturing still contributed about **17%** to India’s GDP, far short of the **25% target**. Factors such as **infrastructure bottlenecks**, **regulatory challenges**, and **labor market issues** have contributed to this slow growth.

2. **COVID-19 Pandemic Impact**: The **COVID-19 pandemic** severely affected manufacturing activities, leading to disruptions in the supply chain, workforce shortages, and decreased investment. However, the government introduced policies like **Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes** to recover from the economic slowdown and boost manufacturing in sectors like electronics and pharmaceuticals.

3. **Dependence on Imports**: Despite efforts to boost domestic manufacturing, India still heavily relies on imports for critical components and raw materials, especially in sectors like electronics and defense.

### Key Reforms

**Semiconductor Ecosystem Development**: Semicon India Program, worth ₹76,000 crore, aims to provide an impetus to semiconductor and display manufacturing by facilitating capital support and technological collaborations.  India has developed policies to support every segment of the semiconductor ecosystem, not just focusing on fabs but also including packaging, display wires, OSATs, sensors, and more.

**National Single Window System (NSWS)**: Launched in September 2021, this platform simplifies the investor experience, integrating clearances from 32 Ministries/ Departments and 29 States/UTs, facilitating rapid approvals.

**PM Gatishakti**: PM Gati Shakti National Master Plan (NMP), a GIS based platform with portals of various Ministries/Departments of Government, was launched in October, 2021.
