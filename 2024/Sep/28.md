# INDIAN OCEAN RIM ASSOCIATION SEMINAR

The **second edition of the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) seminar** on **Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) Fishing** was held on **September 25, 2024**, at the **Naval War College, Goa**. This seminar brought together experts, policymakers, and representatives from IORA member states to address the increasing problem of IUU fishing in the **Indian Ocean Region (IOR)**. The seminar focused on the economic, environmental, and security implications of IUU fishing and reviewed the legal gaps that hinder effective countermeasures.

### The Challenge of IUU Fishing in the Indian Ocean

**IUU fishing** is a significant challenge in the **Indian Ocean**, which is home to some of the world’s most productive fisheries. It undermines **sustainable fishing practices**, disrupts local economies, and causes extensive harm to marine ecosystems. IUU fishing is typically carried out by vessels that violate or evade national or international laws governing fishing, often targeting areas where **monitoring and enforcement** are weak.

The **Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA)**, a regional organization consisting of 23 member states, plays a vital role in coordinating efforts to manage marine resources and safeguard maritime security. IUU fishing has been a longstanding issue in the IOR due to the region's vastness, limited enforcement capabilities, and the economic reliance of several nations on their fisheries. This seminar sought to address these challenges and offer strategies to mitigate the growing threat posed by IUU fishing.

### Economic, Environmental, and Security Implications

**Economically**, IUU fishing has serious consequences for coastal communities in the IOR, where fishing is often a primary livelihood. It leads to the depletion of fish stocks, driving down profits for local fishermen who adhere to regulations, and creating unfair competition with those who operate outside the legal framework. The unchecked depletion of fish stocks also threatens **food security** in several developing nations across the region.

From an **environmental** perspective, IUU fishing exacerbates the degradation of marine ecosystems. Overfishing, the use of illegal gear, and the targeting of endangered species contribute to the destruction of coral reefs, seagrass beds, and other important marine habitats, which in turn affect biodiversity.

On the **security front**, IUU fishing overlaps with broader maritime security issues such as **piracy**, **human trafficking**, and **drug smuggling**. Unscrupulous fishing activities often take place in areas with little regulation or oversight, creating opportunities for criminal networks to thrive.

### Legal and Regulatory Challenges

One of the key discussions at the seminar was the **legal gaps** in addressing IUU fishing. While international agreements like the **United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)** and the **Port State Measures Agreement (PSMA)** exist to regulate fishing, enforcement remains weak. Several **IORA member states** lack the resources or capacity to monitor their **exclusive economic zones (EEZs)** effectively. The seminar reviewed these challenges and sought ways for IORA members to enhance cooperation, share information, and implement stronger enforcement mechanisms.

### The Way Forward

The seminar highlighted the need for **regional cooperation** among IORA member states to combat IUU fishing more effectively. Key recommendations included:
- **Strengthening legal frameworks** at the national and regional levels to close existing loopholes.
- Enhancing **capacity-building efforts** for coastal states to improve monitoring and enforcement capabilities.
- Promoting **data-sharing** and cooperation among IORA nations to ensure a more coordinated response to IUU activities.
- Encouraging greater **engagement with international organizations** and fisheries management bodies to foster a global solution to IUU fishing.

### Conclusion

The second edition of the **IORA seminar on IUU fishing** was a crucial step in addressing the multifaceted challenges posed by illegal fishing in the **Indian Ocean Region**. The seminar underscored the economic, environmental, and security threats of IUU fishing while calling for enhanced regional cooperation and stronger legal frameworks to combat the issue. By continuing these discussions and implementing coordinated actions, IORA member states can better protect their marine resources and contribute to the sustainable development of the region’s fisheries.

Jaishankar** met with his BRICS counterparts during the **79th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA)** to reaffirm the group's significance in promoting **multi-polarity** and **global diversity**. The meeting emphasized BRICS' evolving role in shaping a more **inclusive global order**, amid shifting geopolitical dynamics. The gathering was convened by **Brazilian Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira**, reinforcing Brazil’s leadership role as it currently holds the **BRICS presidency**.

### Expansion of BRICS

Originally comprising **Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa**, BRICS recently expanded to include **Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran**, and the **United Arab Emirates (UAE)** at the start of this year. The enlargement of BRICS signifies a strategic effort to strengthen the group's global influence by incorporating emerging economies from Africa and the Middle East. This expanded BRICS aligns with its core objective of representing the voices of the **Global South** and advocating for **economic cooperation**, **development**, and **equitable governance** on the world stage.

### Key Topics Discussed

During the meeting, Jaishankar highlighted the group's significance in advancing **multi-polarity**—a principle based on the idea that the global power structure should be dispersed across multiple nations, rather than dominated by a few. BRICS has positioned itself as a key player in creating a more balanced global system that reflects the interests of developing countries.

A **range of issues** were discussed, including:
1. **Global Governance Reforms**: The ministers reiterated the need for reform in multilateral institutions like the **United Nations** and the **International Monetary Fund (IMF)** to make them more representative and democratic, especially to accommodate the interests of developing nations.
   
2. **Economic Cooperation**: BRICS members stressed enhancing trade and investment among the group and expanding financial cooperation through mechanisms like the **BRICS New Development Bank (NDB)**, which seeks to offer alternatives to traditional Western-dominated financial institutions like the World Bank.

3. **Geopolitical Stability**: The BRICS meeting addressed ongoing global conflicts and emphasized the need for peaceful dialogue and diplomacy. With the addition of countries like Iran, which is embroiled in regional tensions, the group's role in fostering stability in conflict-prone areas was highlighted.

4. **Climate Change and Development**: Climate change, sustainable development, and energy transitions were also central themes. BRICS countries, many of which are large emerging economies, face the challenge of balancing economic growth with environmental sustainability.

### Affirmation of BRICS' Role in a Multipolar World

Jaishankar’s remarks, emphasizing BRICS’ role in a **multipolar world**, reflect the group’s growing importance in countering the influence of traditional Western powers. BRICS advocates for a system where no single country or bloc dominates global affairs. This vision aligns with India’s broader foreign policy objectives, which emphasize **strategic autonomy**, **inclusive global governance**, and strengthening ties with countries across Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

The meeting marked another step in BRICS’ evolution into a more comprehensive and influential body. Its expanded membership and focus on cooperation in areas such as **development finance**, **trade**, and **peace-building** position the group as a key forum for emerging powers to shape the global agenda.

### Conclusion

The BRICS meeting on the sidelines of the UNGA reaffirmed the group’s significance in promoting a **multi-polar world order**. With its recent expansion and increasing global influence, BRICS continues to challenge traditional power structures and advocate for a fairer global system.

# Russia’s geopolitical pivot to Asia, a new India chapter

In 2022, in the wake of geopolitical tensions and mounting sanctions from the West following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, **Moscow severed many of its long-standing economic ties with Europe** and shifted its focus towards **Asian markets**. This marked a significant departure from decades of economic interdependence between **Russia** and **Europe**, a relationship built on mutual benefits, particularly in the areas of **energy supply** and **trade**. The **neoliberal interdependence** that once existed between the two regions was unraveled, having wide-ranging impacts on both the Russian economy and the global financial system.

### Background of Economic Interdependence with Europe

Since the end of the Cold War, Russia and Europe developed a strong economic relationship, particularly through **energy exports**. **Russia**, one of the largest exporters of **oil and natural gas**, supplied a significant portion of Europe's energy needs, while European markets provided Russia with **capital** and **advanced technologies**. This **interdependence** was mutually beneficial but left both regions vulnerable to **external shocks**.

For Russia, this vulnerability became apparent during moments of political tension. As noted in the aftermath of the **2007–08 financial crisis**, calls were made for Russia to diversify its markets and reduce reliance on Western financial structures. However, these initiatives were repeatedly delayed, leaving Russia highly exposed to fluctuations in the global economy and, more importantly, the impact of **Western sanctions** resulting from political and ideological differences.

### Moscow's Economic Pivot to Asia

By 2022, the escalation of the Ukraine conflict and subsequent **sanctions** imposed by the West forced Russia to act on its long-discussed strategy of shifting its economic partnerships to **Asia**, primarily to **China**, **India**, and other **Southeast Asian nations**. This pivot aimed to **diversify** Russia’s export markets, especially for energy products, and reduce dependence on European markets that were increasingly aligned against Moscow.

This shift to Asia was not just a **political necessity** but also an **economic strategy**. Countries like **China**, which had emerged as a global economic powerhouse, became key trade partners for Russia. In 2022, **Russian energy exports to China surged**, with **gas supplies through the Power of Siberia pipeline** increasing dramatically. **India** also became a major buyer of discounted Russian oil as Europe moved away from Russian energy imports.

### The Global Economic Impact

The **disintegration** of the Russia-Europe economic relationship had significant repercussions for the **global economy**. Europe, for instance, faced **energy shortages** and price spikes due to the disruption in Russian gas supplies, which had been a cornerstone of the continent’s energy security. To mitigate these shortages, Europe turned to **alternative energy suppliers**, resulting in higher **global energy prices**.

For Russia, the pivot to Asia helped cushion the blow of losing the European market, but it also brought challenges. Moscow’s economic reorientation required **new infrastructure** and trade routes to sustain long-term partnerships with Asian markets. Additionally, Russia’s increasing reliance on China raised concerns about **asymmetrical dependence**, as China became a dominant player in determining Russia's economic trajectory.

Globally, the breaking of Russia’s economic ties with Europe contributed to **supply chain disruptions** and further **inflationary pressures** as energy and commodity markets adjusted to the new realities. The sanctions on Russia and its response also affected global **food supplies**, as Russia and Ukraine are both major exporters of **grain** and **fertilizers**. This led to **food insecurity** in various parts of the world, particularly in **developing nations**.

### Long-Term Implications

Russia’s pivot to Asia represents a **geopolitical and economic realignment** that is likely to persist in the coming years. The shift illustrates a broader global trend where countries seek to **diversify** their economic partners and **reduce vulnerability** to political disruptions. While Russia's partnership with Asia has helped mitigate the effects of Western sanctions, the full consequences of this realignment, both for Russia and the global economy, will unfold over the long term.

The decoupling of the **Russia-Europe economic relationship** not only signifies a **geopolitical shift** but also marks the erosion of the **neoliberal interdependence** that had characterized the post-Cold War global economy. It serves as a stark reminder that **economic globalization**, once considered an unstoppable force, can be rapidly undone by **geopolitical events**.

> In 2022, Russia shifted its economic focus from Europe to **Asia**, particularly towards countries like **China** and **India**, following geopolitical tensions and sanctions resulting from the Ukraine conflict. This marked the end of the long-standing **neoliberal interdependence** between **Russia** and **Europe**, which had been rooted in energy exports and trade. Moscow’s pivot to Asia helped mitigate the impact of losing European markets but brought challenges, such as building new infrastructure and increasing reliance on China.

This realignment affected the **global economy**, leading to energy shortages in Europe and supply chain disruptions, driving **inflation** and affecting **global food security**. The broader shift highlights the fragility of **economic globalization** in the face of geopolitical tensions.

# Keep the fire of the self-respect movement going

The **Self-Respect Movement**, initiated in **1925 by E.V. Ramasamy (Periyar)** in Tamil Nadu, was an **emancipatory social and political movement** aimed at empowering individuals and communities to challenge oppressive hierarchical structures, particularly those related to **caste and religion**. It played a crucial role in transforming Tamil Nadu’s political and social landscape by fostering **rationalism**, **social justice**, and **women’s rights**.

![image_name](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1a0uON5CVLYe2nqCczj4PXl23cC1xCJVN)

### Objectives and Ideals

The Self-Respect Movement sought to dismantle the **caste system** and end the **Brahminical dominance** that perpetuated inequalities in Tamil society. Periyar argued that social hierarchy, based on **varna** (caste) and **gender**, was not only discriminatory but also **irrational**. The movement promoted **rational thinking**, urging individuals to question societal norms, superstitions, and religious dogmas that legitimized oppression. **Dravidian identity**, as distinct from Aryan-Brahminical imposition, became a central theme of the movement.

Beyond caste emancipation, the Self-Respect Movement also advocated for **women’s rights**. It challenged patriarchal norms and pushed for **gender equality** by promoting women’s education, opposing child marriage, and supporting widow remarriage. Periyar envisioned a society where women had the **right to self-determination**, free from the constraints of patriarchy.

### Intersection with Dravidian Movement

While the **Self-Respect Movement** is closely associated with the **Dravidian Movement**, which also championed **social justice** and **anti-Brahminism**, there are subtle differences between the two. The Dravidian Movement, primarily led by political entities like the **Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK)** and its offshoots, has placed a more explicit focus on **regional identity** and **Tamil nationalism** alongside social reform. The Self-Respect Movement was more concerned with **abolishing social hierarchies** on the basis of caste and religion and promoting **rationalism** and **atheism**.

The **Dravidian Movement**, especially through the DMK’s leadership, translated many of the Self-Respect ideals into **political governance**, leading to landmark policies like **reservation** for backward classes and **welfare schemes** for marginalized communities. However, the Dravidian political movement integrated **identity politics** into its framework, with a focus on **Tamil pride** and resisting the **centralization of power** by the Indian state, thus combining cultural and linguistic identity with social justice.

### Contemporary Relevance

Today, both movements continue to shape the political landscape of Tamil Nadu, providing a **counterbalance** to the rise of **majoritarian ideologies** across India. The Dravidian parties, rooted in the ideals of **self-respect** and **social justice**, resist the **centralizing tendencies** and **Hindutva-driven majoritarianism** seen in Indian politics. The movements emphasize **secularism**, **rationalism**, and **regional autonomy**, challenging **Hindu nationalist ideologies** that seek to impose **cultural homogeneity**.

Tamil Nadu’s distinct political trajectory, shaped by these movements, highlights the ongoing struggle for **social equity** and **resistance to cultural dominance**. The Self-Respect Movement's legacy of advocating **rational thought**, **gender equality**, and **subaltern politics** ensures that the state remains a beacon of **progressive social reform** in India.

### Conclusion

The **Self-Respect Movement** and the **Dravidian Movement** have together redefined the social and political fabric of Tamil Nadu. While the former focused on social emancipation through rationalism and equality, the latter took these ideals into the realm of political governance. Both movements continue to provide a significant **counter-narrative** to **majoritarian politics** in India, ensuring that the ideals of **social justice**, **equality**, and **rationalism** remain central to the state's political ethos.

> The Self-Respect Movement, initiated in 1925 by E.V. Ramasamy (Periyar), aimed to empower individuals and communities to challenge oppressive caste and religious hierarchies in Tamil society. Focused on rationalism, social justice, and gender equality, it promoted critical thinking, women's rights, and the dismantling of the caste system. Though closely associated with the Dravidian Movement, the Self-Respect Movement emphasized social reform over the Dravidian Movement’s emphasis on regional identity and Tamil nationalism.

# SC raps air quality panel over pollution in capital

On Friday, the **Supreme Court of India** expressed concerns over the **Commission for Air Quality Management’s (CAQM)** effectiveness in tackling air pollution, particularly in the **Delhi-NCR region**. The court noted that while the CAQM has issued directions to reduce pollution levels, these measures seem to have only a **temporary impact** on violators, failing to result in sustained improvements in air quality.

### The Court’s Concerns

The **Supreme Court** highlighted that despite several interventions and guidelines by the CAQM, pollution in the **National Capital Region (NCR)** continues to spike, especially during certain periods like the winter months. These temporary measures do not address the root causes of pollution. The bench observed that the directions were being followed by violators only under pressure from the court or authorities but had little lasting effect, questioning whether these strategies were **deterrents** or merely reactionary responses to immediate crises.

### Role of the CAQM

The **Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM)** was established in **2021** by the central government as a statutory body responsible for coordinating and overseeing efforts to reduce air pollution across the NCR and adjoining states. The body was given powers to issue directions, shut down industries, restrict vehicular movement, and implement pollution-control measures. However, despite these broad powers, pollution levels in **Delhi-NCR** remain stubbornly high, particularly during the onset of winter, when the region faces hazardous levels of air quality due to **stubble burning**, **vehicular emissions**, **industrial pollution**, and **construction dust**.

### Temporary Measures

The court noted that the CAQM’s interventions, which often come in the form of temporary bans on construction, restrictions on vehicular traffic, and industry shutdowns, were not sustainable long-term solutions. For instance, **stubble burning** in neighboring states like **Punjab** and **Haryana** is a seasonal but recurring issue. Every year, the smoke from these fires contributes significantly to Delhi's already polluted air, and while temporary measures such as bans and fines are put in place, the practice continues unabated due to socio-economic factors affecting farmers.

Similarly, the commission’s **Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP)**, which kicks in when pollution reaches certain thresholds, is often implemented reactively rather than proactively, offering short-term relief without tackling the systemic causes of pollution.

### Challenges in Enforcement

Enforcement of pollution-control measures remains a challenge for the CAQM. Many of the industries and sectors contributing to pollution have found ways to **circumvent regulations**, either by resuming operations once temporary bans are lifted or by paying fines, which are often not hefty enough to act as serious deterrents. The **lack of coordination** between different state governments and local authorities further complicates the enforcement of CAQM’s directives, with pollution sources often lying outside the jurisdiction of Delhi.

### Court’s Call for Long-Term Solutions

The Supreme Court has urged the CAQM to adopt **long-term strategies** that focus on **prevention** rather than **reaction**. This could involve permanent solutions such as shifting to **clean energy**, incentivizing the use of **electric vehicles**, ensuring stricter implementation of **pollution norms** in industries, and promoting alternative farming practices to reduce **stubble burning**. The Court also suggested that CAQM improve its **monitoring mechanisms** and establish **accountability systems** to ensure compliance with pollution control measures.

### Conclusion

The Supreme Court’s questioning of the **CAQM** reflects the growing frustration over the **persistent air quality crisis** in **Delhi-NCR**. While the CAQM has taken steps to reduce pollution, the Court has pointed out that these measures are often short-lived and fail to address the underlying causes. For long-term success, the commission will need to implement **holistic**, **proactive** solutions that target pollution sources at their root, ensuring compliance and sustained improvements in air quality across the region.

> The **Supreme Court of India** expressed concern over the **Commission for Air Quality Management’s (CAQM)** effectiveness in curbing pollution, particularly in **Delhi-NCR**. The court observed that while the CAQM’s directives, such as temporary bans on construction and industry shutdowns, have a short-term impact, they fail to produce long-lasting results. These measures are often reactionary and do not address the root causes of pollution, such as **stubble burning**, **vehicular emissions**, and **industrial pollutants**.

The Court urged the CAQM to adopt **long-term, preventive strategies** like promoting **clean energy**, improving **electric vehicle adoption**, and ensuring stricter compliance with environmental norms. It also called for better **monitoring** and **enforcement** to ensure that violators are held accountable and that temporary measures evolve into sustainable solutions for air quality improvement.
