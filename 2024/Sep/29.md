# With new scheme, sun shines on rooftop solar installations

### M Muft Bijli Solar Yojana (PMSY) Overview

The **M Muft Bijli Solar Yojana (PMSY)** is a ₹75,000-crore initiative by the central government aimed at accelerating the installation of rooftop solar systems (RTS) in India. The scheme targets the installation of at least **one crore rooftop solar units** across the country. This move aligns with India's broader renewable energy goals, particularly its commitment to increasing the adoption of clean energy sources and reducing carbon emissions.

The scheme reflects the government's sustained efforts to promote solar energy, building on over two decades of policies and initiatives to encourage solar adoption among households. The PMSY has been developed with the vision to decentralize power generation, reduce the dependence on conventional energy sources, and empower citizens to become prosumers—both consumers and producers of electricity. By focusing on rooftop solar installations, the scheme targets residential areas where the potential for generating renewable energy remains largely untapped.

### Objectives of the Scheme

1. **Boost Renewable Energy Generation:**
   One of the core objectives of PMSY is to increase India's installed solar power capacity by harnessing the potential of rooftops in urban and rural areas. This not only contributes to the overall national solar energy target but also reduces the carbon footprint by promoting clean energy.

2. **Reduce Energy Bills:**
   The name "Muft Bijli," which translates to "free electricity," underscores the scheme's focus on helping households reduce their dependency on conventional electricity sources and lower their electricity bills. By installing rooftop solar systems, households can generate their own electricity, cutting down on electricity costs significantly, and in some cases, even selling excess power back to the grid.

3. **Energy Security for Households:**
   With rising energy demands and the volatility of traditional energy supplies, PMSY aims to enhance energy security at the household level. Rooftop solar installations provide a reliable and sustainable source of energy, ensuring that homes have access to uninterrupted power, especially in areas with frequent outages.

4. **Decentralized Power Generation:**
   The PMSY promotes decentralized energy production, which reduces transmission and distribution losses. It also alleviates pressure on the national grid by distributing power generation responsibilities to individual households. Decentralization can also help reduce the load on traditional power infrastructure, particularly in urban areas.

### Financial Aspects of PMSY

The scheme is backed by a significant investment of ₹75,000 crore, with provisions for subsidies and financial incentives to make solar installations more affordable for households. Under PMSY, the government aims to provide subsidies to homeowners to cover a part of the installation cost. These incentives can vary depending on the size of the solar installation and the state of residence.

Additionally, the scheme encourages the involvement of private sector companies and solar installation firms, thereby fostering a competitive solar market. The involvement of multiple stakeholders is expected to drive down costs and improve service delivery.

### Challenges and the Way Forward

While the PMSY is ambitious in its scale and objectives, it faces several challenges:
   
1. **High Upfront Costs:**
   Despite subsidies, the upfront cost of installing rooftop solar systems can be prohibitive for many households. Although long-term savings are considerable, the initial investment remains a barrier, especially in rural areas or for lower-income groups.

2. **Awareness and Education:**
   Lack of awareness about the benefits of solar power, and how to maintain and manage solar installations, particularly in rural or semi-urban regions, could slow down adoption rates.

3. **Regulatory and Technical Hurdles:**
   Although many states have policies supporting rooftop solar systems, regulatory challenges—such as delays in net-metering approvals, differences in state policies, and grid connectivity issues—can affect the success of the scheme. Additionally, there are technical challenges in integrating decentralized rooftop solar systems with the national grid.

### Conclusion

The **M Muft Bijli Solar Yojana (PMSY)** represents a significant step forward in India's renewable energy journey. By focusing on rooftop solar installations, the government aims to empower households to generate their own electricity, reduce their dependency on fossil fuels, and contribute to the national renewable energy targets. However, for the scheme to succeed, it is crucial to address the financial, technical, and regulatory challenges and increase public awareness and participation. The PMSY, if implemented effectively, has the potential to transform India's energy landscape and bring the country closer to its clean energy goals.

# Communal tension in Odisha’s Bhadrak; Internet shut down

### Internet Shutdown in Bhadrak, Odisha: A Response to Communal Tensions

On Saturday, the Odisha government ordered an **internet shutdown** in the district headquarters town of **Bhadrak** in response to rising communal tensions fueled by social media. This drastic step was taken after authorities observed a surge in inflammatory posts that were circulating online, aggravating an already tense situation. The unrest reportedly began following an **online inflammatory remark** targeting a community’s religious figure, which quickly escalated into **violence and stone-throwing** by agitated crowds.

### Sequence of Events

The trigger for the unrest was a **provocative social media post** related to a religious figure highly revered by one community. This post, deemed offensive by members of the community, caused widespread anger. As news of the post spread, protests erupted in the streets of Bhadrak. What initially began as a protest quickly turned violent, with **stone-throwing incidents** reported in different parts of the town. The violence prompted a rapid response from local law enforcement to control the situation.

Fearing that further circulation of offensive and provocative material on social media platforms could inflame the tensions, the district administration swiftly decided to impose a **temporary internet ban**. By curbing access to the internet, authorities aimed to prevent the spread of rumors and misinformation, which could escalate the communal tensions into full-blown riots.

### Purpose of the Internet Shutdown

The internet shutdown was intended to serve multiple purposes:
1. **Curb Misinformation**: The most immediate goal was to prevent the spread of misinformation and provocative content via social media, WhatsApp, and other platforms. In communal situations, false news or inflammatory posts can rapidly escalate violence.
   
2. **Restore Peace**: By cutting off the flow of information, the administration hoped to cool tempers, giving law enforcement time to restore law and order without the added pressure of rumors fueling the crowds.

3. **Prevent Mobilization**: Social media is often used as a tool for quick mobilization. Authorities feared that protestors or violent elements could use platforms like WhatsApp and Facebook to coordinate more attacks, which is why the shutdown was seen as a pre-emptive measure.

### Impact of the Shutdown

The internet shutdown in Bhadrak led to a **significant disruption** in communication, especially among businesses and residents who rely on online services for their daily activities. In today’s interconnected world, internet outages can have severe consequences, particularly for people who rely on digital tools for commerce, education, and communication. However, in situations of communal unrest, such disruptions are often seen as necessary to prevent the loss of life and property.

While the shutdown succeeded in limiting the immediate spread of provocative material, it also created **difficulties for citizens**. People found themselves cut off from information, updates on the situation, and means to communicate with loved ones. There were also reports of **economic disruption**, particularly for small businesses that depend on digital transactions and communication.

### Legal and Ethical Considerations

India has seen a growing number of **internet shutdowns** in recent years, often imposed in response to communal tensions, protests, or security concerns. While such shutdowns are deemed necessary by authorities to maintain peace and prevent violence, they raise important questions about the balance between **security and freedom of expression**. Critics argue that shutting down the internet curtails people’s rights to access information and communicate freely, which can have longer-term consequences for democratic functioning.

### Conclusion

The **internet shutdown in Bhadrak** is a reminder of the delicate balance authorities must strike between **maintaining public order** and **upholding civil liberties**. While the decision to impose an internet blackout may have been crucial to controlling the communal violence in the short term, it also highlighted the growing reliance on digital communication in modern society. In such cases, it is essential for governments to carefully weigh the pros and cons of such decisions and ensure that shutdowns are used as a last resort and lifted as soon as possible.

As communal tensions continue to simmer in various parts of India, the Bhadrak incident underscores the need for proactive measures to prevent such flare-ups. Education, **community engagement**, and strict legal action against those who spread hate speech can play a vital role in reducing the likelihood of such incidents in the future.

# Can Kerala’s policy to limit antibiotics misuse reduce AMR?

### Operation Amrith: Kerala's Initiative to Combat Antimicrobial Resistance

**Operation Amrith (Antimicrobial Resistance Intervention for Total Health)** is a pioneering initiative launched by the Kerala government with the goal of curbing the **over-the-counter (OTC) sale of antibiotics** without prescriptions by the end of 2024. The program aims to address the alarming issue of **antimicrobial resistance (AMR)**, which poses a major public health threat in India and globally. The indiscriminate use of antibiotics, often without medical guidance, has contributed to the rise of drug-resistant bacteria, making infections harder to treat and increasing the risk of severe health consequences.

### The Problem of Antimicrobial Resistance

Antimicrobial resistance occurs when bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites evolve and become resistant to medicines, particularly antibiotics. This makes previously treatable infections, such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, and urinary tract infections, harder to cure. The **irrational use of antibiotics**—including taking them without prescriptions, overusing them for viral infections where they are ineffective, or not completing the prescribed course—has accelerated the development of drug-resistant microbes.

India is one of the world's largest consumers of antibiotics, and Kerala, like other states, has faced the consequences of this trend. For years, antibiotics have been sold without proper regulations, contributing to **self-medication** and **over-prescription**. This has not only made patients more vulnerable to resistant infections but also put a strain on the healthcare system.

### Impact of Operation Amrith

Operation Amrith is designed to bring about a systematic change in how antibiotics are accessed and used. The program’s ultimate goal is to **completely stop the sale of antibiotics without a prescription** by the end of 2024. As part of the initiative, the Kerala government has implemented strict regulations across **hospitals, medical stores, and pharmacies** to ensure antibiotics are only dispensed with a valid doctor’s prescription.

Since the launch of the program, Kerala has witnessed a **sharp decline in the irrational use of antibiotics**. According to media reports, the sale of antibiotics through hospitals and medical stores in the state has dropped by **₹1,000 crore in the last year**. This decline reflects the **increased awareness and compliance** among medical professionals and the general public about the dangers of overusing antibiotics.

### Key Components of the Program

1. **Awareness Campaigns**: The state has launched extensive awareness campaigns aimed at educating the public about the proper use of antibiotics and the dangers of AMR. These campaigns target not only the general population but also healthcare professionals, ensuring they prescribe antibiotics responsibly.

2. **Stricter Regulations**: Under Operation Amrith, pharmacies and medical stores are being closely monitored to ensure that antibiotics are only sold with a legitimate prescription. This includes random checks and penalties for violations. Additionally, doctors are being encouraged to limit the prescription of antibiotics to cases where they are genuinely needed.

3. **Training for Healthcare Providers**: The program also emphasizes training healthcare providers, including doctors and pharmacists, on the **rational use of antibiotics**. By reducing unnecessary prescriptions and encouraging alternative treatments for non-bacterial infections, the initiative seeks to reduce dependency on antibiotics.

4. **Improved Surveillance**: Kerala has also strengthened its surveillance systems to track antibiotic usage patterns and AMR trends. This data-driven approach allows for more informed policy decisions and the ability to monitor progress in real-time.

### Benefits and Future Outlook

The success of Operation Amrith so far points to the effectiveness of the **multi-pronged strategy** adopted by Kerala to fight AMR. The reduction in antibiotic sales indicates that people are becoming more conscious of the dangers of misuse, and that pharmacies are complying with the new regulations. By preventing the over-the-counter sale of antibiotics, the state has taken a crucial step towards limiting the rise of drug-resistant bacteria.

Looking ahead, Kerala’s **goal of completely eliminating non-prescription sales by 2024** seems achievable given the early success of the initiative. However, continued vigilance is needed to ensure that these efforts are sustained over time. There is also potential for other Indian states to replicate Kerala’s model, as the fight against AMR requires nationwide action.

### Conclusion

Operation Amrith represents a landmark effort in Kerala’s public health policy, addressing one of the most pressing global health challenges of the 21st century. By effectively regulating antibiotic use and raising awareness about AMR, Kerala is setting an example for the rest of India. The sharp decline in the sale of antibiotics is a positive sign that the state is on the right track, and with continued efforts, Kerala could achieve its goal of eradicating the over-the-counter sale of antibiotics by the end of 2024.

> Operation Amrith is a Kerala government initiative aimed at stopping the **over-the-counter sale of antibiotics** without prescriptions by 2024, in response to the growing threat of **antimicrobial resistance (AMR)**. Since its launch, the state has seen a significant reduction in **irrational antibiotic use**, with a ₹1,000 crore decline in sales over the past year. The program includes **public awareness campaigns, stricter regulations on pharmacies, and training for healthcare providers** to promote the rational use of antibiotics. Operation Amrith is seen as a successful model in combating AMR and could inspire similar efforts across India.

# Why has the SC clarified POCSO provisions?

### Supreme Court Verdict on Online Sexual Material Involving Children

In a significant ruling, the **Supreme Court of India** has provided clarity on the penal consequences associated with dealing with online sexual content involving children. The court underscored that activities such as **viewing, downloading, and storing** such material, in addition to **creating, uploading, and transmitting** it, are all offences under the **Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act**. This landmark judgment broadens the scope of criminal liability for individuals involved in the consumption and possession of child sexual exploitation material (CSEM), signaling a stricter stance on child protection.

### The POCSO Act and its Provisions

The **POCSO Act**, enacted in 2012, was designed to address the increasing instances of sexual offences against children. It provides robust legal safeguards to prevent child sexual abuse, with stringent penalties for offences related to both physical and virtual exploitation of minors. However, before this ruling, there was a legal grey area surrounding the **extent of liability** for individuals involved in the passive consumption of such material—those who viewed, downloaded, or stored it without actively disseminating it. 

### Expansion of Criminal Liability

The Supreme Court’s ruling emphasizes that **mere possession or viewing** of child sexual exploitation material is enough to attract penal consequences. By extending criminal liability to those who engage in passive activities such as downloading or storing these materials, the court has clarified that any involvement with such content, even if it does not involve its creation or distribution, is a criminal act under the POCSO Act.

This ruling signals a clear message: even if an individual does not directly participate in the production or dissemination of child sexual exploitation material, they can still be held criminally responsible if they are found to possess or consume such content. The court observed that **online sexual exploitation of children** is a severe crime that can cause long-lasting harm to victims, and anyone contributing to the demand or consumption of such material is complicit in perpetuating the exploitation.

### Key Implications of the Verdict

1. **Wider Scope of Accountability**: The ruling ensures that not just creators or distributors of child sexual abuse material, but also individuals who view, download, or store such material, can be prosecuted. This extension of liability reflects the seriousness of crimes against children and the need for a holistic approach to tackling child exploitation.

2. **Deterrence against Consumption**: By holding individuals accountable for merely viewing or storing such material, the court hopes to create a strong deterrent against the consumption of child sexual abuse content. The ruling makes it clear that ignorance or passive consumption is not a defense, and all actions related to CSEM will be treated as serious crimes.

3. **Strengthening Child Protection Laws**: This verdict strengthens the enforcement of the **POCSO Act** by closing potential loopholes that offenders could exploit. Earlier, individuals could argue that they were not involved in the creation or transmission of illegal content, but this judgment establishes that **possession and viewing** of such material are just as culpable.

4. **Potential for Increased Prosecutions**: The expanded interpretation of criminal liability under the POCSO Act may lead to an increase in prosecutions, especially in cases involving individuals who engage in viewing or storing child sexual abuse material. Law enforcement agencies will now be empowered to take stricter action against a wider range of offenders involved in the exploitation of children online.

### The Importance of Online Vigilance

The Supreme Court’s verdict also underscores the growing threat posed by online platforms in facilitating the distribution of child exploitation material. With the proliferation of internet access and digital devices, there has been an alarming rise in the availability and consumption of CSEM. This ruling emphasizes the need for **online vigilance**, stronger monitoring, and coordinated efforts to curb the spread of such content.

### Conclusion

The **Supreme Court’s ruling** marks a significant step forward in the fight against child sexual exploitation in India. By expanding criminal liability to include those who view, download, or store such content, the court has highlighted the critical need to address all aspects of online child exploitation. The judgment sends a strong message that any involvement with child sexual abuse material, no matter how passive, is a grave offence under the POCSO Act, and will be met with severe legal consequences.

> In a significant ruling, the **Supreme Court of India** has clarified that under the **POCSO Act**, viewing, downloading, or storing child sexual exploitation material (CSEM) is as criminal as creating, uploading, or transmitting it. The court expanded criminal liability to those passively consuming such content, stressing that even possessing or watching it constitutes a serious offence. This verdict strengthens the enforcement of child protection laws, aims to deter the consumption of CSEM, and closes legal loopholes. The ruling underscores the importance of online vigilance and signals a stronger legal approach to tackling child sexual exploitation.
