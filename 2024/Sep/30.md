# Dark Matter and Neutrino Fog: An Overview

### Dark Matter and Neutrino Fog: An Overview

Both **dark matter** and **neutrinos** represent two mysterious and fascinating elements in the study of cosmology and particle physics. Though they are distinct phenomena, they both contribute significantly to our understanding of the universe’s structure, formation, and evolution. The term **neutrino fog** often refers to the idea of a diffuse cloud of neutrinos that fills the universe, contributing to the overall mass of the cosmos and affecting cosmic evolution, much like dark matter. 

Let’s explore these concepts in detail:

---

### **Dark Matter**

Dark matter is a form of matter that doesn't emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it invisible to the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Despite being undetectable by telescopes, scientists infer its existence from its **gravitational effects** on visible matter (such as stars, galaxies, and clusters of galaxies). Dark matter constitutes about **85% of the total matter** in the universe and around **27% of its total energy**.

#### Key Characteristics of Dark Matter:
1. **Invisible**: Dark matter doesn't interact with electromagnetic radiation (light), so we can’t see it directly.
2. **Gravitational Effects**: Its presence is inferred from the gravitational pull it exerts on galaxies and clusters, keeping galaxies intact and influencing their rotation.
3. **Structure Formation**: Dark matter played a crucial role in forming the large-scale structure of the universe, as it provided the necessary gravitational pull for gas and dust to form stars and galaxies.

#### Possible Candidates for Dark Matter:
- **Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs)**: These hypothetical particles could make up dark matter by exerting gravitational influence but not interacting significantly with normal matter.
- **Axions**: Another possible candidate, axions are light, hypothetical particles that may contribute to dark matter.
- **MACHOs (Massive Compact Halo Objects)**: These are massive objects like black holes or neutron stars that could constitute some portion of dark matter, though unlikely to explain all of it.

While dark matter explains gravitational anomalies, its exact nature remains elusive.

---

### **Neutrino Fog**

Neutrinos are **subatomic particles** that are nearly massless, neutral, and only interact via the weak nuclear force and gravity. Produced in large quantities during the **Big Bang** and in nuclear reactions like those in stars, neutrinos are incredibly abundant and nearly impossible to detect because they pass through matter without interaction.

The idea of a **neutrino fog** refers to a vast cloud of relic neutrinos that fills the universe, remnants of the Big Bang. These neutrinos, though having very low mass and weak interactions, can still exert a small gravitational effect and thus contribute to the universe’s total mass-energy content. While the contribution of neutrinos to the total mass is much smaller compared to dark matter, they are still an important cosmic component.

#### Neutrino Characteristics:
1. **Extremely Light**: Neutrinos have a very tiny mass compared to other particles, but since they exist in such large numbers, their collective mass could be significant.
2. **Weakly Interacting**: Neutrinos rarely interact with ordinary matter, which makes them difficult to detect. Large detectors like **Super-Kamiokande** are used to capture rare interactions.
3. **Cosmic Neutrino Background**: Neutrinos from the early universe are analogous to the **Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)** radiation but are harder to detect due to their weak interaction.

### Interplay between Dark Matter and Neutrinos

While **dark matter** and **neutrinos** are distinct in their properties, they both have crucial roles in the evolution and structure of the universe:

- **Mass Contribution**: While dark matter makes up a much larger portion of the universe’s mass, neutrinos still contribute through the **neutrino fog**, adding to the gravitational forces shaping cosmic structures.
- **Structure Formation**: Neutrinos, because of their high velocities and weak interaction, do not clump together to form structures like dark matter. However, they can slightly smooth out the formation of cosmic structures by slowing down the growth of gravitational wells created by dark matter.
- **Detection Challenges**: Both dark matter and neutrinos are notoriously difficult to detect. While neutrinos can be detected in specialized detectors, dark matter has so far only been inferred through gravitational effects, with no direct detection.

---

### Challenges in Understanding Dark Matter and Neutrinos

1. **Detection**: Detecting dark matter remains one of the greatest challenges in physics. Numerous experiments, including **XENON** and **LUX-ZEPLIN**, are trying to directly detect dark matter particles, while **neutrino detectors** like **IceCube** and **Super-Kamiokande** focus on detecting high-energy neutrinos.
  
2. **Mass of Neutrinos**: Determining the exact mass of neutrinos is crucial for understanding their role in cosmology. Current experiments are trying to measure this with more precision.

3. **Dark Matter Candidates**: Identifying the exact nature of dark matter is a high priority in modern physics. Various theoretical particles, including WIMPs, axions, and sterile neutrinos, are candidates, but none have been confirmed.

---

### Conclusion

While **dark matter** and the **neutrino fog** represent different components of the cosmos, they both illustrate the invisible yet profound forces shaping the universe. Dark matter, with its gravitational pull, structures galaxies and clusters, while the pervasive neutrino fog subtly influences cosmic evolution. Both remain among the most enigmatic subjects in modern physics, and their study is vital to unlocking the mysteries of the universe’s composition and development.

> Dark matter and the neutrino fog are crucial yet mysterious components of the universe. **Dark matter** makes up about 85% of all matter and affects galaxies through its gravitational pull, though it is invisible and doesn’t interact with light. **Neutrinos** are nearly massless, weakly interacting particles that permeate the universe, forming a "neutrino fog." While neutrinos contribute a small amount to the universe's total mass, they still influence cosmic evolution. Both dark matter and neutrinos are difficult to detect, and their study is essential for understanding the formation, structure, and future of the universe.

# Common Practice Standards must have India outlook

India’s agroforestry sector holds immense potential, offering a unique opportunity to integrate environmental sustainability with economic development. Agroforestry, the practice of integrating trees and shrubs into agricultural systems, not only enhances agricultural productivity but also contributes significantly to the country's carbon sequestration efforts. By aligning agroforestry practices with carbon finance projects such as Afforestation, Reforestation, and Revegetation (ARR) initiatives, India can make strides in both climate action and rural development.

### Current State of Agroforestry in India

Agroforestry currently covers approximately 28.4 million hectares of land, accounting for 8.65% of India’s total land area. This practice is prevalent in regions where agricultural and forestry activities are closely integrated, providing farmers with additional income through the sale of timber, fruits, and other tree-related products. The government's National Agroforestry Policy, introduced in 2014, has helped boost the practice by providing technical support, financial incentives, and awareness programs to farmers. However, the potential for expansion remains vast, with projections suggesting that the area under agroforestry could increase to 53 million hectares by 2050.

### Carbon Finance and Agroforestry

One of the key advantages of agroforestry is its ability to act as a natural carbon sink. Currently, agroforestry systems contribute 19.3% of India’s carbon stocks, playing a critical role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This is particularly important for India, which has made ambitious commitments under the Paris Agreement to reduce its carbon footprint and enhance forest cover.

By expanding agroforestry practices, India can significantly increase its carbon sequestration potential. Afforestation, Reforestation, and Revegetation (ARR) initiatives are a natural fit for this sector, as they focus on restoring degraded lands and increasing forest cover. These projects are eligible for carbon credits under international carbon finance mechanisms, such as the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and other voluntary carbon markets.

Through carbon finance, farmers and landowners can receive financial compensation for maintaining or increasing the carbon stocks on their land. This creates a dual benefit: while farmers generate income from their crops and trees, they also receive payments for the environmental services their agroforestry systems provide. This can be a powerful tool for incentivizing sustainable land management and reducing deforestation rates.

### Environmental and Economic Benefits

Agroforestry provides a range of environmental benefits beyond carbon sequestration. By integrating trees into farming systems, it improves soil health, increases biodiversity, and reduces the need for chemical inputs like fertilizers and pesticides. Trees help regulate water cycles by reducing runoff and increasing groundwater recharge, which is crucial for addressing water scarcity in many parts of India.

Economically, agroforestry offers farmers diversified income sources. In addition to agricultural crops, farmers can harvest timber, fruits, medicinal plants, and other non-timber forest products. This diversification reduces the economic risks associated with farming, such as crop failure due to pests, diseases, or extreme weather conditions.

Furthermore, agroforestry systems can contribute to rural employment, especially in activities related to tree planting, nursery management, timber processing, and the sale of agroforestry products. As the sector expands, it can create job opportunities for millions of people, particularly in rural areas, supporting India’s broader goals of inclusive and sustainable development.

### Expanding Agroforestry: Challenges and Solutions

Despite its potential, agroforestry faces several challenges in India. These include land tenure issues, lack of access to markets for tree products, and insufficient technical knowledge among farmers. Furthermore, smallholder farmers may lack the financial resources to invest in tree planting and maintenance, despite the long-term benefits.

To address these challenges, policy measures need to focus on increasing financial incentives for farmers, improving access to markets, and providing technical training. The government’s National Agroforestry Policy is a step in the right direction, but it requires more robust implementation, especially at the local level. Public-private partnerships can also play a role in scaling agroforestry by creating supply chains for agroforestry products and linking them to domestic and international markets.

### Conclusion

India's vast potential in the agroforestry sector presents a significant opportunity to contribute to both climate action and rural development. By expanding agroforestry from 28.4 million hectares to 53 million hectares by 2050, the country can enhance its carbon sequestration capabilities and contribute to its climate goals. Through carbon finance initiatives and improved policy support, agroforestry can offer a win-win scenario for farmers and the environment. The expansion of this sector not only enhances sustainability but also provides economic resilience for rural communities, paving the way for a greener and more prosperous future.

> India’s agroforestry sector, currently covering 28.4 million hectares and contributing 19.3% of the country’s carbon stocks, offers significant potential for environmental and economic benefits.

There is potential to expand this area to 53 million hectares by 2050, contributing to India’s climate goals through Afforestation, Reforestation, and Revegetation (ARR) initiatives. Carbon finance projects can incentivize farmers by offering payments for carbon sequestration. Expanding agroforestry can also provide diversified income for farmers, reduce economic risks, and generate rural employment.

# Demand flux

India’s robust GDP growth of 8.2% in 2023-24 stands as a significant achievement, positioning the country as one of the fastest-growing major economies globally. However, two concerning indicators accompanied this high growth rate: a slowdown in the farm sector due to unfavorable monsoon conditions and a marked decline in private consumption growth, which rose at just 4%. These trends present potential challenges for the sustainability of India’s growth in the coming years.

### Farm Sector Slowdown

Agriculture, which still employs a significant portion of India's workforce and contributes around 15-18% to the country’s GDP, faced considerable setbacks in 2023-24. The Indian monsoon, a critical driver of agricultural productivity, was erratic and insufficient in key regions, particularly in the crucial crop-growing periods. Monsoons not only affect crop yields but also influence rural incomes, which in turn have a substantial impact on overall consumption and economic demand.

The weak performance in the farm sector has broader implications for the economy. A slowdown in agriculture reduces rural incomes, leading to a fall in rural demand for goods and services. This is significant because rural India has historically been a major driver of consumption in sectors like fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), automobiles, and textiles. If this trend continues, it could dampen growth in these industries, potentially affecting job creation and further stunting economic momentum.

Moreover, the farm sector’s vulnerability to climate change-induced disruptions like erratic rainfall, floods, and droughts presents an ongoing risk. If the government does not address this issue through better irrigation systems, crop diversification, and climate resilience measures, the farm sector could continue to underperform, dragging down the broader economy.

### Weakness in Private Consumption

Private consumption, measured by Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFCE), grew by only 4% in 2023-24. This is a notable slowdown compared to India’s overall GDP growth rate and is the weakest growth in private consumption since 2002-03, barring the exceptional pandemic year of 2020-21. Historically, private consumption has been a key driver of India’s economic growth, accounting for over 55% of the country’s GDP. Hence, a slowdown in consumption could pose significant risks to future growth prospects.

There are several reasons for this dip in private consumption. High inflation, particularly in essential commodities like food and fuel, has eroded household purchasing power. Rising interest rates, in response to inflation, have increased the cost of borrowing, making consumers more cautious about discretionary spending on big-ticket items such as automobiles, appliances, and housing. The uneven recovery in employment, especially in the informal sector, has further limited income growth and consumption capacity among large sections of the population.

This decline in consumption is concerning because it suggests that the benefits of high GDP growth have not sufficiently trickled down to households. The mismatch between overall economic growth and consumption growth points to a deeper structural issue: rising inequality. Wealthier segments of society may be driving investment and GDP growth, while lower- and middle-income households struggle with inflation and inadequate wage growth, leading to subdued consumption patterns.

### Implications for Future Growth

The twin challenges of a slowing farm sector and weakening private consumption could impede India’s long-term growth trajectory. The economy's heavy reliance on domestic consumption makes it vulnerable to shocks in household spending. If private consumption continues to lag behind GDP growth, it may not only reduce demand for goods and services but also affect business investment and employment generation.

To address these concerns, the government must prioritize policies that directly boost household incomes and consumption. This could include targeted subsidies, income support for rural populations, and measures to contain inflation, especially in food and fuel. Expanding social safety nets and enhancing access to credit for small businesses and farmers would also help stimulate demand. 

Simultaneously, enhancing the productivity and resilience of the agricultural sector is essential. Investing in infrastructure, such as better irrigation systems, as well as promoting crop diversification and modern farming techniques, could reduce the sector’s dependence on erratic monsoon patterns and improve rural incomes.

### Conclusion

India’s 8.2% GDP growth in 2023-24 is a notable achievement, but it comes with underlying challenges. The slowdown in the farm sector and the weakening of private consumption growth could limit future economic expansion. Addressing these issues through targeted policies aimed at boosting rural incomes, increasing consumption, and ensuring sustainable agricultural practices will be crucial for sustaining India’s growth momentum in the coming years.

> India’s 8.2% GDP growth in 2023-24, while impressive, faces two key challenges: a slowdown in the farm sector due to erratic monsoons and weak private consumption growth. Agriculture’s underperformance impacts rural incomes and demand, affecting broader economic sectors. Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFCE) grew by only 4%, the slowest since 2002-03, excluding the pandemic year, driven by high inflation, rising interest rates, and weak wage growth. These issues reflect rising inequality and could hamper future growth. Addressing rural incomes, boosting consumption, and improving agricultural resilience will be essential for sustaining long-term economic momentum.

# 92% of workers cleaning urban sewers, septic tanks belong to SC, ST, OBC groups, finds survey

In a pioneering initiative to assess the extent of hazardous manual cleaning of sewers and septic tanks in urban areas across India, government data reveals that the vast majority of workers involved in these dangerous jobs come from marginalized communities. This data was gathered from over 3,000 urban local bodies in 29 states and Union Territories, aiming to address a longstanding issue related to caste-based occupational discrimination and dangerous working conditions.

![image_name](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1PwL5U9S_NY1zxrZuNPuabAa2g809zvzo)

### Key Findings

According to the government data, 91.9% of the 38,000 workers profiled belong to Scheduled Caste (SC), Scheduled Tribe (ST), or Other Backward Class (OBC) communities. These figures underscore the disproportionate burden that manual scavenging and related hazardous jobs place on historically marginalized groups. SCs, in particular, have borne the brunt of this dangerous work, largely due to social, economic, and historical factors tied to India's deeply entrenched caste system.

Manual scavenging, which involves cleaning sewers, septic tanks, and dry latrines, is a dangerous and inhumane job, often conducted without adequate protective equipment or safety measures. Workers frequently suffer from serious health issues due to exposure to toxic gases and harmful pathogens. In extreme cases, such exposure has led to fatalities. Despite laws prohibiting manual scavenging, such as the *Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013*, the practice persists in various parts of the country, largely in urban areas where poor infrastructure necessitates the manual cleaning of sewage systems.

### The Scope of the Survey

The data collection, which is the first of its kind, is part of a broader attempt by the Indian government to enumerate those engaged in hazardous sanitation work. The goal is to identify workers who are forced into these jobs due to economic necessity, social discrimination, or a lack of alternative employment opportunities. The survey aims to provide these workers with appropriate rehabilitation and safety measures, including access to alternate employment, skills training, and financial aid.

While the government’s efforts to document the extent of this hazardous occupation are commendable, the data so far paints a grim picture of the persistence of caste-based exploitation in modern India. The overwhelming representation of SC, ST, and OBC communities among these workers reflects the deep-rooted structural inequalities that continue to shape the Indian labor market.

### Caste and Hazardous Work

Historically, the work of cleaning human waste was assigned to those at the bottom of the caste hierarchy, especially Dalits (formerly referred to as “untouchables”). This practice, rooted in centuries of discrimination, has continued in various forms despite efforts to abolish caste-based labor divisions. SC, ST, and OBC communities have remained trapped in these dangerous occupations due to poverty, lack of education, and continued social exclusion.

Although legal provisions exist to protect sanitation workers, their implementation has been uneven. Many workers continue to perform these jobs due to the absence of mechanized alternatives and the failure of authorities to strictly enforce the law. The manual cleaning of septic tanks and sewers remains a grim reality, particularly in cities where the infrastructure does not support modern waste management practices.

### Government Efforts and the Path Forward

The Indian government has launched several initiatives aimed at ending manual scavenging and rehabilitating workers engaged in hazardous cleaning. The *Swachh Bharat Mission* (Clean India Mission) and the *Safaimitra Suraksha Challenge* are examples of efforts to mechanize sanitation work and promote the dignity of labor for sanitation workers. These programs emphasize the need for mechanized cleaning solutions and safer working conditions.

However, the ongoing challenge is to ensure that these initiatives reach the communities that need them the most. Effective implementation of laws, strict penalties for violations, and greater investment in mechanized sanitation systems are critical to ending this practice. Rehabilitation programs, including education, vocational training, and social support, must be prioritized to ensure that workers can transition to safer and more dignified livelihoods.

The profiling of sewer and **septic tank workers (SSWs)** is being carried out by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment as part of its **NAMASTE programme**, a scheme to mechanise all sewer work and prevent deaths due to hazardous cleaning work. In 2023-24, this scheme was brought in to replace the Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers (SRMS).

### Conclusion

The data highlighting the overrepresentation of SC, ST, and OBC communities in hazardous cleaning jobs in India’s urban areas exposes the enduring caste-based inequalities in the country’s labor market. While the government’s efforts to document and address these issues are a step in the right direction, much remains to be done to protect workers from exploitation and provide them with safer, more dignified employment opportunities. Ending this practice will require sustained political will, financial investment, and a societal commitment to breaking the nexus between caste and dangerous labor.

> A government survey of over 3,000 urban local bodies across 29 Indian states and Union Territories reveals that 91.9% of the 38,000 workers engaged in hazardous sewer and septic tank cleaning belong to Scheduled Caste (SC), Scheduled Tribe (ST), or Other Backward Class (OBC) communities. This highlights the enduring caste-based exploitation in sanitation work, despite laws banning such practices. The dangerous nature of this work, combined with social and economic discrimination, continues to trap marginalized communities. While government initiatives aim to end manual scavenging and provide rehabilitation, much more is needed for effective implementation and safer employment opportunities.

# Israel pounds Lebanon, 2 more Hezbollah leaders among dead

In recent escalations, Israel has intensified its military actions against Hezbollah in Lebanon, focusing on high-profile targets within the group. Following the elimination of Hezbollah’s chief, Hassan Nasrallah, Israel continued its airstrikes deep into Sunday evening, signaling its commitment to crippling the group's operational capabilities. These strikes form part of Israel’s broader strategy in the region, which has been marked by heightened tensions and military confrontations between Hezbollah and Israel over the years.

The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed that they had struck nearly 120 Hezbollah targets across Lebanon. These operations are part of Israel’s ongoing efforts to neutralize the militant group’s infrastructure, including weapons depots, command centers, and other strategic assets. By launching such extensive strikes, Israel aims to weaken Hezbollah’s military strength and limit its capacity to retaliate against Israeli civilians or forces.

A significant development occurred just hours after the initial wave of attacks when Israeli military officials announced that they had killed Nabil Kaouk, the deputy head of Hezbollah’s Central Council, in a targeted strike on Saturday. Kaouk, a senior and influential figure within Hezbollah, had been instrumental in shaping the group’s military strategy and was considered a key architect of Hezbollah’s activities in southern Lebanon.

The killing of both Nasrallah and Kaouk marks a severe blow to Hezbollah’s leadership, creating a power vacuum that could potentially disrupt the group’s operations. Israel’s focus on eliminating top-tier commanders reflects a tactical approach aimed at disorganizing Hezbollah’s hierarchy. This could undermine their ability to coordinate effective responses to Israeli actions, at least in the short term.

The airstrikes, however, have also raised concerns of further regional instability. Hezbollah has historically maintained a strong presence in Lebanon, with significant support among certain factions of the population. Israel’s aggressive actions might provoke a counter-offensive from Hezbollah, potentially leading to a broader conflict that could involve neighboring countries.

In conclusion, Israel’s continued airstrikes and the targeted killings of key Hezbollah leaders represent a decisive effort to degrade the group's capacity for military action. However, the long-term ramifications of this escalation remain uncertain, as Hezbollah may regroup and retaliate, fueling further violence in an already volatile region.

Hezbollah: Overview
Hezbollah, or "Party of God," is a Shiite Islamist political and militant organization based in Lebanon. Formed in the early 1980s, it emerged with backing from Iran, and its original objective was to resist the Israeli invasion of Lebanon. Over time, Hezbollah has grown into a powerful political force, militia, and regional actor, with a deep influence on Lebanese politics and broader Middle Eastern geopolitics.

Founding and Ideology
Hezbollah was founded in 1982, during the Lebanese Civil War, following Israel’s invasion of Lebanon. Its formation was heavily influenced by Iran’s Islamic Revolution, and it received substantial support from Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Hezbollah’s ideology is rooted in Shiite Islam, with a strong anti-Israel and anti-Western stance. The organization seeks the creation of an Islamic state in Lebanon based on the principles of Wilayat al-Faqih, which promotes the leadership of religious clerics in political matters.

The organization's primary goals include:

Resistance to Israel: Hezbollah considers the liberation of Jerusalem and the elimination of Israeli influence in the region as its key missions.
Opposition to Western Influence: Hezbollah opposes U.S. and Western involvement in the Middle East, which it views as imperialistic.
Promotion of Shiite Islam: It supports the establishment of Islamic governance, primarily inspired by Iran’s theocratic model.

> Israel has intensified airstrikes on Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, following the killing of Hezbollah’s chief, Hassan Nasrallah. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed they struck nearly 120 Hezbollah targets, aiming to weaken the group’s military capabilities. A key development was the killing of Nabil Kaouk, the deputy head of Hezbollah’s Central Council, in an Israeli strike. This, alongside Nasrallah’s death, deals a significant blow to Hezbollah's leadership. Israel's actions could provoke further conflict, as Hezbollah may retaliate, potentially escalating tensions in the region.

# Bridging the chasm of global inequality

The Summit of the Future, a major platform for discussing the trajectory of global governance, raises critical questions about the direction the world should take in managing international relations and addressing pressing global challenges. Among the fundamental questions that arise from the summit is whether the focus should be on the great power competition, which has historically shaped geopolitics, or on the deeper structural issues such as imbalance in global institutions, agenda-setting mechanisms, and global inequality. These debates strike at the heart of what global governance should prioritize and how the international community should work toward creating a fairer, more stable world order.

### Great Power Competition: A Focus on Means, Not Ends

Great power competition refers to the strategic rivalry between major global powers, most notably the United States, China, and Russia. This competition involves military, economic, technological, and ideological dimensions. Each of these powers seeks to assert its influence globally, shaping international norms and institutions in ways that reflect their interests. The resurgence of such competition has become a defining feature of international relations in recent years, particularly with the rise of China as a global superpower and the increasingly assertive foreign policy of Russia. Meanwhile, the U.S., which has dominated the global order since the end of World War II, continues to defend its position while adjusting to new realities.

The focus on great power competition is often a debate centered on the means—how power is distributed and exerted, and how global influence is negotiated and maintained. This form of governance focuses on balance of power, deterrence, and realpolitik, often sidelining the broader purpose of governance: ensuring justice, peace, and prosperity for all. From this perspective, the debate frequently revolves around military alliances, trade wars, and territorial disputes rather than addressing the root causes of global insecurity, such as poverty, inequality, and underrepresentation in international institutions.

Furthermore, the competition between these great powers often leads to paralysis in global institutions like the United Nations, where veto-wielding powers can block crucial reforms or interventions that are in the common interest of humanity. As global governance becomes more fragmented and multipolar, the emphasis on state-centric strategies threatens to exacerbate existing inequalities and make it more difficult to address transnational challenges such as climate change, pandemics, and migration.

### Imbalances in Global Institutions and Agenda Setting

On the other hand, the alternative to focusing on great power competition is to prioritize correcting the imbalances in global institutions and addressing systemic global inequality. Currently, global governance structures, such as the UN Security Council, International Monetary Fund (IMF), and World Bank, disproportionately reflect the interests of wealthy, industrialized nations. The global South, encompassing developing and emerging economies, is often sidelined in decision-making processes despite representing the majority of the world’s population.

Agenda setting is another key area where imbalances persist. The agendas of international institutions are often dominated by issues that reflect the concerns of the most powerful nations—security, trade, and finance—while neglecting issues such as development, human rights, and social justice that are critical for the less developed world. As a result, global inequality continues to widen, both within and between nations. Many argue that this reflects a fundamental lack of fairness in the international system, where the voices of marginalized communities, particularly in Africa, Latin America, and parts of Asia, are drowned out by the interests of the global elite.

Addressing these imbalances would require a rethinking of the power structures that undergird global governance. Reforming institutions like the UN Security Council to include more equitable representation, particularly for regions like Africa and Latin America, would be a step toward a fairer system. Similarly, efforts to democratize agenda-setting in global forums—giving more weight to issues like climate justice, sustainable development, and inequality—could align global governance with the needs and aspirations of all people, rather than just the most powerful.

### The Continuing Debate on Justice

Underlying these questions is a broader, ongoing debate about the meaning of justice in global governance. Is justice merely the preservation of a stable international order, as great power competition suggests, or does it require addressing deeper, structural inequalities that perpetuate poverty, conflict, and environmental degradation?

For many developing nations and marginalized groups, justice means a system where they have an equal voice and the ability to influence decisions that affect their lives. It means creating institutions that serve not just the powerful but the entire global community, ensuring that prosperity and security are shared.

The Summit of the Future provides a timely opportunity to shift the conversation away from short-term, power-centric solutions toward a more just and inclusive global order. The challenge lies in whether the international community is willing to take the necessary steps to reform the current system and focus on justice as the ultimate goal of governance.

### Conclusion

The Summit of the Future raises vital questions about the future of global governance: should the focus remain on great power competition, or should it shift toward addressing imbalances in global institutions and tackling global inequality? While the former emphasizes the distribution and exercise of power, the latter seeks to address deeper issues of fairness, justice, and inclusion. For a more sustainable and just future, it is crucial that global governance reforms prioritize addressing systemic imbalances and promoting equitable representation, so that the benefits of development and security are shared by all, not just the most powerful.

> The Summit of the Future raises key questions about global governance, debating whether the focus should be on great power competition or addressing imbalances in global institutions and inequality. Great power competition emphasizes the distribution of power, often neglecting justice and perpetuating global inequality. In contrast, addressing imbalances in institutions like the UN and IMF would give marginalized nations and communities a greater voice in global decision-making. This shift would prioritize issues like climate justice and inequality, moving toward a fairer and more inclusive international system. The ongoing debate centers on whether justice or power should guide global governance.
