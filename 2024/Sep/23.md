# GST Council Reviewing Tax Rates Item by Item for Rationalization: Sitharaman

**GST Council Reviewing Tax Rates Item by Item for Rationalization: Sitharaman**

Finance Minister **Nirmala Sitharaman** recently highlighted that the **Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council** is conducting a thorough review of tax rates, focusing on an **item-by-item** basis to rationalize and improve the tax system. The move comes as part of the government’s broader effort to streamline the GST framework, address rate anomalies, and ensure fairness in taxation across various sectors.

### Objective of GST Rationalization
The GST regime, implemented in 2017, has undergone several modifications. While the primary goal was to simplify indirect taxation, there have been demands from industries and stakeholders to **correct tax rate inconsistencies**. In response, the **GST Council** is now re-examining tax rates on specific goods and services to achieve:
1. **Revenue Neutrality**: Ensure that rate adjustments neither hurt revenue collection nor burden taxpayers unnecessarily.
2. **Removal of Inconsistencies**: Address disparities where similar goods or services are taxed at different rates.
3. **Sectoral Relief**: Certain sectors, such as **automobiles, textiles, and real estate**, have been advocating for tax rate adjustments, either to lower the burden or encourage consumption.

### Sitharaman’s Statement
Addressing the media, **Sitharaman** emphasized that the rationalization effort is not just about increasing or decreasing rates arbitrarily. Instead, the **GST Council** aims to make the tax structure more **equitable and efficient** by examining the tax burden on each commodity or service individually. She noted that this process involves evaluating current rates, revenue generation, and the potential impact on consumers and businesses.

She also reiterated that the GST Council’s decisions are **consultative** and driven by consensus among **states and the central government**. By working closely with state representatives, the Council aims to ensure that the rationalization serves both **national economic interests** and the **financial autonomy of states**.

### Current Progress and Future Steps
Several tax rate revisions have already been proposed, particularly for **luxury goods** and items considered **essential**. For instance, reducing GST on essential goods while ensuring higher taxes on luxury items would maintain the progressive nature of the tax system. Additionally, sectors like **education, healthcare**, and **green energy** are being considered for favorable rate revisions to promote wider accessibility and sustainability.

In conclusion, Sitharaman assured that the **GST Council’s rationalization process** will continue to evolve with input from various stakeholders, making the tax system more transparent, predictable, and balanced. This strategic review aims to enhance the ease of doing business in India while safeguarding the country’s revenue interests【59†source】【60†source】.

# Fact-checking cannot be an excuse to impose censorship

The Centre’s move to create a ‘fact-checking unit’ empowered to order the removal of ‘fake or false or misleading’ information from digital and social media platforms was never likely to succeed. Justice A.S. Chandurkar of the Bombay High Court struck down the amended rule, in a tie-breaking ruling after a two-judge Bench, in January, was split over its constitutional validity. In an opinion that makes it a 2:1 decision, he agreed with the view of Justice G.S. Patel, who had held that the provision violated the right to freedom of expression and sought to coercively classify speech as true or false based on vague and undefined terms. The rule, introduced as an amendment in 2023 to the rules governing information technology intermediaries and digital media ethics, meant that once the fact-checking unit flagged a piece of information on a social media platform as fake, false or misleading, the platform was bound to take it down. 
 two of the three judges have found the rule unconstitutional, noting that the terms ‘fake’, ‘false’ or ‘misleading’ were not defined and there was no scope for redress provided in the rules. Another point that went against the government was that the restriction was applied only to information about the Centre, and not other kinds of information. Justice Chandurkar also agreed with Justice Patel that a restriction on free speech based on whether something is true or false was not one of the circumstances listed in Article 19(2) of the Constitution for imposing reasonable restrictions
A **fact-checking unit** is a dedicated team or organization focused on verifying the accuracy of claims, statements, and information. These units help in combating misinformation and disinformation, especially in areas such as news, politics, and public communication.

### Key Features of a Fact-Checking Unit:
1. **Verification of Facts**: Fact-checking units assess the **truthfulness** of claims by comparing them against credible and reliable sources, such as official records, scientific studies, or expert interviews.
   
2. **Focus Areas**: These units work on diverse topics, such as government policies, public health, elections, and viral social media content. They help prevent the spread of **misinformation** by issuing corrections or clarifications.

3. **Government and Media Units**:
   - Many **news organizations** have in-house fact-checking units, such as *FactCheck.org* or *PolitiFact*.
   - In India, the **Press Information Bureau (PIB)** has a **Fact Check Unit** that focuses on debunking false claims about government schemes and policies.
   
4. **Tools and Methods**: Fact-checkers use a variety of tools, including **reverse image searches**, **data cross-referencing**, and **expert consultations** to validate information.

### Importance:
Fact-checking units play a vital role in maintaining the **integrity of information** in the public domain. By verifying facts and dispelling rumors, they promote **informed decision-making** and strengthen democratic processes.

### Example:
The **PIB Fact Check** in India, launched by the government, helps debunk misinformation related to government policies, ensuring the public receives accurate information.

# Capturing the cost of healthy diets

Despite improvements in **poverty reduction** and **rising incomes** in India over the past decade, the country continues to face a major challenge in improving its **nutritional outcomes**. The **National Family Health Surveys (NFHS)** from **2015-16** and **2019-21** reveal persistently high rates of **undernutrition** among children, along with rising rates of **anaemia** among adults. At the same time, India has witnessed an increase in **obesity** and **overweight prevalence**, both in rural and urban areas. This situation, known as the **“triple burden of malnutrition,”** includes the coexistence of undernutrition, overnutrition, and **micronutrient deficiencies**.

### Key Barriers to Healthy Diets
One of the major obstacles to tackling this issue is the **cost of healthy diets**. Healthy and nutritious diets, which are essential for addressing all three aspects of malnutrition, remain unaffordable for a significant portion of the population. Recent data highlights the issue of rising food prices, especially for **vegetables, fruits, pulses, and eggs**, all of which are critical components of a nutritious diet. Coupled with stagnating or declining real wages, the affordability of healthy food has become a growing concern.

The **State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2024** report indicates that **55.6% of India’s population** (around 788 million people) could not afford a diet that meets their nutritional needs as of 2022. This underscores the severe implications of rising food prices on food security and nutritional outcomes.

### The “Triple Burden of Malnutrition”
India’s battle with malnutrition is unique, as it faces the challenges of **undernutrition, overnutrition, and micronutrient deficiencies** simultaneously. While children continue to suffer from **stunting** and **wasting**, an increasing number of adults, particularly in urban areas, are grappling with **obesity**. Additionally, **anaemia rates** have risen across all demographics, pointing to widespread deficiencies in vital micronutrients like iron and vitamins.

### Moving Forward
Addressing these issues will require a multi-faceted approach. Policies should focus on making healthy foods more affordable and accessible, ensuring that all income groups can afford **nutritious diets**. This can be done through **subsidies**, **price controls**, and **nutrition-sensitive agricultural policies**. Moreover, public health campaigns promoting **dietary diversity** and awareness are critical in helping families make informed food choices despite financial constraints.

In conclusion, while India has made notable progress in poverty alleviation and income growth, much more needs to be done to ensure that **nutritional improvements** follow suit. Achieving better dietary outcomes is key to overcoming the “triple burden” and improving the overall health of the population.

> The **State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2024 report** estimates that 55.6% of India’s population (788 million people) could not afford to purchase a diet that met their nutritional needs as of 2022.
The National Family Health Surveys (NFHS) in 2015-16 and 2019-21 show stubbornly high rates of undernutrition among children and high (and rising) rates of anaemia among adults, even as obesity and overweight prevalence has increased in both rural and urban areas.
Healthy nutritious diets are widely recognised as key to tackling the so-called **‘triple burden of malnutrition’**, that is, the coexistence of undernutrition, overnutrition, and micronutrient deficiencies, as is the case in India. Unfortunately, most Indians do not consume healthy diets.

# On the pitfalls of estimating GDP

**Gross Domestic Product (GDP)** is the most comprehensive measure of a country's economic performance. It reflects the total monetary value of all goods and services produced within a nation's borders over a specific time period. GDP serves as a critical tool for comparing the economic size and productivity of different countries or regions, and for assessing various economic factors like tax burdens, welfare expenditures, or growth rates. Understanding GDP is essential for evaluating a country's economic health, and its calculation is carefully done using a base year to ensure accuracy over time.

### Importance of GDP at Constant Prices
To account for inflation and changes in price levels, economists prefer to use **real GDP** or GDP at **constant prices**. This measure adjusts for price fluctuations, allowing for a clearer view of real economic growth. Real GDP is calculated using a **base year**—a specific year chosen to standardize price levels. This helps isolate the effect of economic output from price changes, providing a more accurate assessment of growth over time.

### Revising the Base Year
The **National Statistical Office (NSO)** is responsible for updating the GDP base year periodically to account for changes in the economy, such as shifts in production patterns, consumption habits, and technological advancements. Typically, the base year is revised every **5 to 10 years** to reflect more current data on **output composition** and **relative prices**. Revising the base year ensures that the GDP calculations are in line with the present economic realities.

Currently, the GDP series uses **2011-12** as the base year, but the NSO has proposed shifting to **2020-21**. This adjustment is necessary to incorporate the latest economic data and to reflect changes that have occurred in the economy over the past decade. For example, sectors like technology and digital services have grown significantly, and their impact on the economy needs to be better reflected in GDP calculations.

### Datasets for GDP Estimation
To estimate GDP, a wide array of **datasets** are used, including data on **output, prices, employment**, and production across different sectors of the economy. These datasets help determine the value of goods and services produced and are crucial for calculating GDP both at current and constant prices.

In the proposed revision to the 2020-21 base year, one major challenge has been the **unavailability of recent Census data**, which typically provides demographic and economic information crucial for GDP calculations. However, the NSO is exploring alternatives such as using data from the **Goods and Services Tax (GST)** system. This represents a significant shift in methodology, as the NSO is considering replacing the **Ministry of Corporate Affairs' MCA-21** database with **GST data** to estimate value addition, particularly in the **Private Corporate Sector (PCS)**, which accounts for about **38% of India's GDP**.

### The Role of GST Data in GDP Calculation
The introduction of **GST** in 2017 marked a significant reform in India's indirect tax system. By unifying various state and central taxes under one umbrella, GST has led to a more streamlined and transparent tax collection system. The wealth of data generated through GST filings offers valuable insights into the business activities of both large and small enterprises. The NSO believes that using **GST data** could provide a more accurate and comprehensive picture of economic activity, particularly in sectors like manufacturing and services, which are major contributors to GDP.

Replacing the **MCA-21 database** with **GST data** could help address gaps in the estimation of value addition in the economy. GST data offers broader coverage of businesses, including smaller enterprises that may not be fully captured by MCA-21. It also reflects real-time transactions and value added in the economy, making it a potentially more robust dataset for GDP calculations.

### Conclusion
The revision of India's GDP base year from **2011-12** to **2020-21** is a significant step aimed at improving the accuracy and relevance of economic data. By incorporating **GST data** and updating the base year, the NSO is aligning GDP estimates with the current economic landscape. This will provide policymakers with better insights for **decision-making** and help in assessing **India's economic growth** more accurately in the coming years.

> India's GDP base year is set to be revised from **2011-12** to **2020-21** to better reflect the current economic landscape. The **National Statistical Office (NSO)** plans to replace the **MCA-21 database** with **GST data** to estimate value addition, particularly in the **Private Corporate Sector**. This change aims to improve the accuracy of GDP calculations, although recent Census data is still unavailable, posing a challenge to this revision process.

# Judicial appointments and disappointments

The **Constitution of India** operates on the principle of separation of powers, ensuring a balance between the **executive**, **legislature**, and **judiciary**. However, the true greatness of the judiciary lies in its **independence**, which is essential for upholding democracy. Nevertheless, **judicial independence**, if unchecked, can become undemocratic and dangerous. For the judiciary to function effectively, it must be subjected to **constitutional discipline**, ensuring **accountability** and adherence to rules of **good conduct**. Without these, judicial independence could lead to **arrogance** and **misuse of power**.

### The Importance of Judicial Independence
**Judicial independence** is the cornerstone of a democracy. It ensures that judges can make decisions without external pressures, especially from the **executive** or **legislature**. The judiciary must remain **free** from any influence that could compromise its ability to uphold justice. This is crucial in safeguarding the rights and freedoms of individuals as provided by the Constitution.

However, judicial independence does not imply **absolute autonomy**. There must be a balance between independence and **accountability** to ensure that judicial power is exercised responsibly. Independence without accountability may lead to **arbitrariness** or **judicial overreach**, where judges act beyond their constitutional mandate.

### Chief Justice S.H. Kapadia’s Observations
At an event on **Independence Day**, **Chief Justice S.H. Kapadia** emphasized the delicate balance between judicial accountability and judicial independence. He pointed out that while judicial independence is vital, it must be accompanied by a strong sense of **accountability**. This view aligns with the principle that **judges are not above the Constitution** and must act within the framework of the law.

Kapadia’s remarks highlight the need for **self-restraint** in the judiciary. Judges must remain conscious of their **constitutional limitations** and avoid becoming too powerful or disconnected from the public they serve. This accountability ensures that judges maintain their **objectivity**, **impartiality**, and **integrity**, which are essential for the public's trust in the judiciary.

### Salman Khurshid’s Comments on Judicial Propriety
Around the same time, **Law Minister Salman Khurshid** remarked on the importance of **judicial propriety**. He stressed that judges must uphold high standards of behavior, both inside and outside the courtroom. Judicial propriety ensures that judges remain respectful, professional, and considerate, safeguarding the dignity of the judiciary and preventing any potential for the judiciary to misuse its power.

**Khurshid's remarks** further underline the importance of reconciling judicial independence with **ethical behavior**. While judges are expected to be independent, they are also expected to maintain **sober and restrained behavior**, avoiding arrogance or overreach. This is essential to preserving the **public's confidence** in the judicial system.

### Reconciliation of the Trinity
The **executive**, **legislature**, and **judiciary** must operate in harmony for the Constitution to function effectively. Each branch has distinct roles, but they must work together within the bounds of **constitutional propriety**. This balance ensures that no one branch oversteps its authority, preserving the integrity of the democratic system.

For the judiciary, this means maintaining independence while being subject to **good conduct rules** and **accountability mechanisms**. Mechanisms like **judicial review**, **ethical guidelines**, and the role of the **National Judicial Accountability Commission** (when implemented) serve to keep judicial power in check.

### Conclusion
The independence of the judiciary is essential for upholding the **rule of law** and protecting the rights of individuals. However, independence must be tempered by **constitutional discipline** and **accountability**. As Chief Justice Kapadia and Law Minister Khurshid both emphasized, a judiciary that exercises **restraint**, adheres to **ethical principles**, and maintains **accountability** will continue to strengthen democracy. Balancing judicial independence with accountability ensures that the judiciary remains a pillar of integrity and fairness in the Indian democratic framework.

> Judicial independence is critical for a functioning democracy, but it must be balanced with accountability and ethical behavior. **Chief Justice S.H. Kapadia** emphasized this balance, stressing that unchecked judicial independence could lead to overreach or misuse of power. **Law Minister Salman Khurshid** similarly highlighted the importance of **judicial propriety** and ensuring judges uphold ethical standards. The **executive, legislature, and judiciary** must work together within constitutional limits, ensuring checks and balances to avoid any branch becoming too powerful. Accountability and ethical conduct are essential for maintaining public trust in the judiciary and upholding democratic principles.
