# Why the ‘fact-checking’ unit was invalidated

On **September 20, 2024**, the **Bombay High Court** declared the amended **Information Technology (IT) Rules, 2021**, which empowered the central government to establish a **Fact Check Unit (FCU)**, as **unconstitutional** and **vague**. The FCU was intended to identify "fake or false or misleading" content related to the government and its establishments. The judgment was delivered by **Justice Atul Sharachchandra Chandurkar**, acting as the "tie-breaker" judge after a division bench comprising **Justices G.S. Patel and Neela Gokhale** reached a split verdict in **January 2024**.

### Background

The **IT Rules, 2021** were originally notified in February 2021, with the intention of regulating digital platforms, social media intermediaries, and online content publishers. In April 2023, amendments were introduced to these rules, authorizing the Centre to establish a **Fact Check Unit (FCU)**. The FCU’s purpose was to identify and flag online content that was deemed to be “fake or false or misleading” with respect to the government and its agencies. Content flagged by the FCU would then be liable for removal by social media platforms, with failure to comply potentially leading to sanctions, including loss of intermediary status and legal protections.

The amendments and the creation of the FCU sparked controversy and concern over potential misuse of power and its impact on free speech. Critics, including journalists, media platforms, and civil rights activists, argued that the amendments lacked clarity and could be used to suppress dissent and criticism of the government. The matter eventually reached the Bombay High Court.

### The Split Verdict

In **January 2024**, the division bench of Justices G.S. Patel and Neela Gokhale delivered a **split verdict** on the matter. Justice Patel expressed concerns over the vagueness of the amended rules and their potential to infringe upon **freedom of speech and expression** as guaranteed by **Article 19(1)(a)** of the Indian Constitution. Justice Patel argued that the amendments lacked clear definitions and could lead to arbitrary actions by the government, potentially stifling dissent and legitimate criticism.

On the other hand, Justice Gokhale found merit in the government's argument that the amendments were necessary to combat the growing problem of **fake news** and **disinformation**, which could undermine public trust and democratic institutions. She opined that regulating online content about government institutions was essential to curb misinformation.

As a result of the split verdict, a third judge, **Justice Atul Chandurkar**, was appointed to break the deadlock.

### The Final Verdict

In his judgment, **Justice Chandurkar** struck down the amended IT Rules as **unconstitutional**. He observed that the amendments were overly **vague** and lacked sufficient safeguards to prevent misuse. The lack of clear definitions for terms such as "fake," "false," and "misleading" content could lead to subjective interpretations, allowing the government too much discretion in deciding what content could be removed.

Justice Chandurkar emphasized the importance of protecting **freedom of speech** and noted that while combating fake news is essential, it cannot come at the cost of fundamental rights. He stated that the amendments posed a threat to legitimate criticism of the government and its institutions, a key element of any functioning democracy.

### Implications of the Judgment

The ruling has significant implications for digital governance and free speech in India. By declaring the Fact Check Unit (FCU) unconstitutional, the High Court has sent a strong message about the need for clear and precise regulations that do not infringe upon fundamental rights. The judgment highlights the importance of **judicial oversight** in balancing the fight against fake news with the need to protect democratic freedoms.

The government may now need to revisit the IT Rules and introduce more specific and constitutionally sound amendments if it seeks to regulate online content related to the government effectively. The judgment also serves as a reminder that the regulation of digital platforms, while necessary, must be carried out in a manner that respects the core principles of **transparency, accountability**, and **free expression**.

### Conclusion

The Bombay High Court’s decision to strike down the amended IT Rules and the establishment of the **Fact Check Unit** reaffirms the judiciary’s role in safeguarding constitutional rights, particularly **freedom of speech and expression**. While addressing the challenge of fake news is crucial, it must be done within the framework of **constitutional protections**, ensuring that regulations are not used as tools to curb dissent or control public discourse.

> On **September 20, 2024**, the **Bombay High Court** ruled that the amended **Information Technology (IT) Rules, 2021**, which allowed the Centre to create a **Fact Check Unit (FCU)** to flag "fake, false, or misleading" content about the government, were **unconstitutional** and **vague**. The judgment, delivered by **Justice Atul Chandurkar** following a split verdict in January 2024, stated that the amendments lacked clear definitions, leaving room for government misuse and threatening **freedom of speech**. While recognizing the need to combat fake news, the court emphasized that this must be done in a way that protects fundamental rights and prevents arbitrary actions.

# Unemployment rate has not fallen: labour survey

The **Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS)** for the period between **July 2023 and June 2024**, released by the **Labour Bureau** on Monday, has revealed that there has been no significant change in the **unemployment rate (UR)** in India. Despite expectations of a recovery in job creation, the data shows that the unemployment situation has largely remained stagnant, with some sectors continuing to struggle in providing new employment opportunities. 

A release by the Union Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation said that in rural areas, the **Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR)** increased from 50.7% in 2017-18 to 63.7% in 2023-24, while for urban areas, it increased from 47.6% to 52%.

“LFPR for males in India increased from 75.8% in 2017-18 to 78.8% in 2023-24 and corresponding increase in LFPR for females was from 23.3% to 41.7%,” the release said.

The LFPR for Muslim women increased from 15% in 2021-22 to 21.4% in 2023-24. In the case of Hindu women, the participation in workforce increased from 26.1% in 2021-22 to 33.3% in this year. Similarly, among Sikh and Christian women, the LFPR increased from 19.8% to 26.7% and 34.2% to 38.3%, respectively.

In rural areas, the **unemployment rate** decreased from 5.3% in 2017-18 to 2.5% in 2023-24, while for urban areas, it decreased from 7.7% to 5.1%. “UR for male in India decreased from 6.1% in 2017-18 to 3.2% in 2023-24 and corresponding decrease for female was from 5.6% to 3.2%,” the Centre said. The overall unemployment rate is 3.2%, similar to last year.
### Key Findings of the PLFS

#### 1. **Unemployment Rate**
The **unemployment rate** has remained unchanged from the previous year, signaling that India is still facing challenges in creating enough jobs to accommodate its growing labor force. This is particularly concerning given the size and scope of the Indian workforce, where millions of people enter the job market every year. The stagnation in the unemployment rate suggests that the economy, despite being one of the fastest-growing in the world, is not generating sufficient employment, especially in key sectors like manufacturing.

#### 2. **Agriculture Sector**
One notable trend from the report is the **slight increase in the distribution of workers in agriculture**. This minor shift in labor distribution may indicate that more people are turning back to agriculture as a source of livelihood due to a lack of job opportunities in other sectors. The agriculture sector, historically the backbone of the Indian economy, continues to absorb a large share of the workforce, though this is often seen as a fallback option when jobs in other sectors, such as manufacturing and services, are not available. The increase in agricultural employment suggests limited progress in diversifying employment opportunities in other industries.

#### 3. **Manufacturing Sector**
The **manufacturing sector** showed **no growth in employment** compared to previous years. This stagnation is a matter of concern, as manufacturing is typically seen as a crucial sector for job creation, especially for semi-skilled and unskilled labor. The sector has been struggling due to various challenges, including the aftermath of the pandemic, supply chain disruptions, and global economic slowdowns. The lack of growth in manufacturing jobs implies that structural reforms and investments in the sector have yet to translate into significant job creation, hindering the broader goal of generating employment for millions of workers.

#### 4. **Women's Workforce Participation**
The report did, however, present some positive news regarding the participation of **women in the workforce**, which has shown an improvement. This is a significant development, as the government had previously faced criticism for the **decreasing participation of women** in the labor force and the growing **unemployment rate among women**. The improvement in women’s workforce participation suggests that targeted efforts to improve gender inclusivity in employment may be yielding results. However, this increase is still from a relatively low base, and much more work is needed to ensure sustained progress in this area.

### Challenges and Government Response

The Indian government has faced considerable criticism in recent years for its handling of the unemployment issue, particularly regarding the slow pace of job creation in sectors like manufacturing and services. Additionally, the declining participation of women in the workforce had also become a focal point of criticism. The increase in female labor force participation may alleviate some of these concerns, but the overall stagnation in job creation points to deeper structural challenges in the economy.

While various government schemes and initiatives, such as **Make in India** and **Skill India**, aim to address the unemployment crisis, their impact on the ground has been limited so far, especially in terms of creating sustainable employment opportunities in high-growth sectors.

### Conclusion

The **Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS)** for the period between July 2023 and June 2024 highlights some important trends in India’s labor market. While the overall unemployment rate remains stagnant, indicating a lack of progress in job creation, the increased participation of women in the workforce is a positive sign. However, the continued reliance on agriculture for employment and the stagnation in the manufacturing sector suggest that much more needs to be done to create diverse and sustainable employment opportunities. The government will need to address these structural challenges if it is to meet the growing demand for jobs in the coming years.

> The **Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS)** for July 2023 to June 2024 shows no major change in India's **unemployment rate**, highlighting stagnant job creation, particularly in the **manufacturing sector**, which saw no growth in employment. A slight increase in workers turning to **agriculture** suggests limited job opportunities in other sectors. However, there was a positive improvement in **women's workforce participation**, addressing previous criticism of declining female employment. Despite this, deeper structural issues persist in the economy, and the government faces challenges in generating sustainable and diverse employment opportunities across sectors to meet growing demand.

# Good beginning, says India on UNSC reform document

On September 22, world leaders reached a significant milestone by adopting the **“Pact of the Future”** by consensus, a landmark document that emphasizes the necessity of reforming the **United Nations Security Council (UNSC)**. The pact underscores the **urgent need** to make the Security Council more **representative, inclusive, transparent, efficient, effective, democratic, and accountable**. This call for reform reflects growing concerns over the UNSC’s structure and functionality, particularly in the face of current global challenges such as geopolitical tensions, conflicts, and inequality.

### Background and the Need for Reform

The United Nations Security Council, one of the principal organs of the United Nations (UN), is responsible for maintaining international peace and security. Since its establishment in 1945, the UNSC has retained a structure largely based on the geopolitical realities of the post-World War II era. It comprises **15 members**: five permanent members (**P5**)—the United States, the United Kingdom, China, Russia, and France—each holding **veto power**, and ten non-permanent members elected for two-year terms without veto rights.

Over the decades, the global political and economic landscape has changed dramatically, yet the composition of the UNSC has remained static. Emerging powers like **India**, **Brazil**, and **South Africa**, along with other regions, have called for reforms to reflect the current global order better. The veto power of the P5 has often been a point of contention, as it allows any one of the five permanent members to block resolutions, regardless of the majority opinion within the Council. This has led to gridlocks in addressing pressing global conflicts, as seen in situations like Syria or Ukraine, where P5 members have used their veto powers to protect their geopolitical interests.

### Key Objectives of the “Pact of the Future”

The **Pact of the Future** represents a consensus among UN member states on the need to update the structure and function of the UNSC to make it more aligned with modern realities. The key points outlined in the pact include:

1. **Representation**: The document stresses the need to make the UNSC more representative by including countries from underrepresented regions, such as Africa, Latin America, and Asia. This would give greater voice to developing countries and ensure a more equitable global power balance.

2. **Inclusivity and Transparency**: Inclusivity and transparency are central to the pact's vision. Reforming the UNSC is expected to make decision-making processes more inclusive, allowing all nations to have a say in global peace and security matters. Transparency in discussions and resolutions is also emphasized to build trust among the international community.

3. **Efficiency and Effectiveness**: The pact also calls for improving the efficiency of the UNSC. The existing structure has often been criticized for being slow and ineffective in responding to global crises. A reformed UNSC would aim to act swiftly and decisively in maintaining peace, addressing conflicts, and responding to humanitarian crises.

4. **Democratic Accountability**: Finally, the pact insists on making the UNSC more democratic and accountable. The current power dynamics within the Council, especially the veto power of the P5, often undermine broader consensus. The reforms would seek to curb the unilateral use of vetoes and make the UNSC more answerable to the broader international community.
In the **“Pact of the Future”**, world leaders agreed to redress the historical injustice against Africa as a priority and, while treating Africa as a special case, improve the representation of the under-represented and unrepresented regions and groups including Asia-Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean. They agreed to **“enlarge”** the Security Council to be more representative of the United Nations membership and reflective of the realities of the contemporary world.

### Challenges to Reform

While the **Pact of the Future** reflects a shared global consensus on the need for reform, significant challenges remain. The permanent members, particularly those with veto power, have historically resisted changes that would dilute their influence. Any substantial reform, such as expanding the Council’s permanent membership or limiting veto power, would require broad support, including from the P5 themselves. This presents a major obstacle, as these nations are unlikely to relinquish their veto privileges willingly.

### Conclusion

The adoption of the **Pact of the Future** marks an important step toward addressing long-standing calls for reform of the **United Nations Security Council**. By committing to make the UNSC more representative, inclusive, transparent, efficient, and accountable, world leaders have set the stage for future negotiations aimed at transforming the global governance system. However, achieving these reforms will require overcoming significant political resistance, particularly from the P5 members, and building a broad international consensus on how best to move forward.

> On September 22, world leaders adopted the **“Pact of the Future”**, calling for urgent reform of the **United Nations Security Council (UNSC)** to make it more **representative, inclusive, transparent, efficient, effective, democratic, and accountable**. The pact emphasizes the need for better global representation, particularly from underrepresented regions, and advocates for more transparent and democratic decision-making. The reform also aims to limit the inefficiencies caused by the veto power held by the five permanent members (P5). However, significant challenges remain, as the P5 may resist changes that could reduce their influence within the Council.

# The NCrF as a framework for well-rounded education

The **National Credit Framework (NCrF)** is a key reform under India’s **National Education Policy (NEP)**, designed to bring flexibility and inclusivity to the country’s education system. By providing a flexible template for institutions offering education across various levels—school, higher, vocational, and skill education—the NCrF seeks to unify the accumulation and transfer of academic credits, making education more accessible, multidisciplinary, and holistic. This framework reflects the NEP's vision of transforming the traditional educational setup into one that embraces flexibility, skill acquisition, and lifelong learning.

### Key Features of the National Credit Framework (NCrF)

1. **Unified Credit System**:  
   The NCrF introduces a **unified credit system** that allows students to accumulate credits not only through traditional academic programs but also through vocational training and skill development courses. This system integrates both formal and non-formal education, enabling students to transition seamlessly between different forms of education. For instance, a student could transfer credits earned in a vocational program to a higher education institution (HEI) or use academic credits towards skill-based certification.

2. **Multidisciplinary Learning**:  
   The framework encourages **multidisciplinary education**, which is a significant shift from the previously rigid, compartmentalized system. Students can pursue diverse fields of study and skills without being confined to a single discipline. For example, a student studying engineering could also earn credits for taking courses in liberal arts, entrepreneurship, or vocational skills. This flexibility aligns with the NEP’s vision of breaking down silos in education and promoting well-rounded, globally competent individuals.

3. **Flexibility and Mobility**:  
   One of the most important aspects of the NCrF is the **flexibility** it offers to students. Learners can enter and exit educational programs at different stages, collecting credits for their learning across different levels and institutions. This mobility allows students to pause and resume their education as needed, accommodating personal or financial circumstances. The system thus fosters a **lifelong learning** approach, recognizing that education does not have to follow a linear path and can be resumed or reshaped at any point.

4. **Skill and Vocational Integration**:  
   A central aim of the NCrF is to bridge the gap between **academic education** and **vocational training**. By valuing skill education equally and enabling credit accumulation for such courses, the framework ensures that vocational skills are no longer seen as secondary or inferior to academic qualifications. This change is crucial for a country like India, where skill development is essential for addressing unemployment and meeting industry demands.

5. **Credit Accumulation and Transfer**:  
   The NCrF facilitates the **accumulation and transfer of credits** across institutions and disciplines, making it easier for students to move between different educational programs. This system is particularly useful for those seeking to change fields of study or combine academic and skill-based learning. For example, a student could transfer credits from a diploma program to a degree course, reducing redundancy in learning and saving time and resources.

6. **Non-Regulatory and Enabling Nature**:  
   Unlike traditional frameworks, which often focus on compliance and regulation, the NCrF is an **enabling framework**. It provides guidelines for institutions to adopt and implement flexible credit systems without imposing rigid mandates. This approach empowers educational institutions to customize the framework based on their specific needs and contexts, promoting innovation in educational delivery.

### Impact and Potential of NCrF

The introduction of the NCrF has the potential to **democratize education** in India by making it more **inclusive** and **student-centric**. By valuing skills and vocational education alongside academic learning, the framework addresses a long-standing challenge in the Indian education system—ensuring employability and practical skills for graduates. The flexibility offered by the NCrF can also support the **NEP’s goal of achieving a gross enrollment ratio (GER) of 50% by 2035**, by allowing more students to participate in higher education without the constraints of rigid systems.

Furthermore, the NCrF aligns with the global push toward **lifelong learning** and **multidisciplinary education**, preparing students to navigate complex, evolving job markets. As India looks to strengthen its workforce and economy, the NCrF could play a crucial role in equipping learners with the necessary skills and knowledge to thrive in various sectors.

### Conclusion

The **National Credit Framework (NCrF)** is a transformative initiative that redefines how education is structured and delivered in India. It promotes flexibility, multidisciplinary learning, and the integration of vocational and skill-based education with traditional academic systems. By offering a unified and adaptable system for credit accumulation and transfer, the NCrF empowers students to pursue varied learning pathways, thus fostering a more inclusive and holistic educational environment. The framework is a key step toward realizing the vision of the NEP and preparing India’s learners for the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century.

# Court has done well to clarify law on online content showing child sex abuse

The **Supreme Court** of India’s clear delineation of the penal consequences of accessing or storing sexual material concerning children is in complete consonance with the letter and spirit of the **Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act**. Demonstrating an enlightened approach to the social questions that arise from the proliferation of online content featuring sexual exploitation of children, a three-Judge Bench has not only clarified the law but also drawn pointed attention to the legislative intent of presuming the culpable mental state of a person accessing and viewing such material. The Court has also advocated that the term **‘child pornography’** be avoided in both the law and in court verdicts, as it appears to trivialise the enormity of the offence of exploiting children to create and disseminate sexual material to gratify the perversions of a few. Instead, the Court has suggested that such content be described as **‘Child Sexual Exploitative and Abuse Material’ (CSEAM)**. The verdict also lays to rest doubts over what exactly some provisions of the **Information Technology Act, 2000**, and **POCSO Act** say on the subject, as High Court verdicts have differed on their exact implications. The case arose from a Madras High Court judgment that quashed a criminal case against an individual who had viewed sexual content involving children on the ground that the law only criminalised creating and disseminating such content, and not merely watching it in the private domain. The apex court has now set aside the High Court order.

Invoking the **doctrine of “constructive possession”**, it has ruled that any act of viewing or displaying of child pornographic material over the Internet without actual possession or storage in any device would also amount to “possession”, made punishable under Section 15 of POCSO, provided the person had a degree of control over such material. Further, an intent to share or transmit such material can also be inferred from any failure to delete, destroy or report such material. It has cautioned courts against narrow interpretation of some provisions so that the legislative intent of penalising cyber-offences relating to children is not defeated. It has drawn attention to Section 67B of the IT Act, terming it a “comprehensive provision” to penalise various electronic forms of exploitation and abuse of children online. The Court has reminded platforms and intermediaries of their duty to remove such content as well as report it to police units concerned. Its advice to the government to implement **comprehensive sex education programmes** that include the legal and ethical ramifications of child pornography merits immediate attention.
The doctrine of constructive possession is a legal principle used in property law, criminal law, and other areas to attribute possession of an object or property to a person who may not physically have it but has control over it or access to it.

> The Supreme Court of India has made a landmark ruling regarding the penal consequences of accessing or storing material involving the sexual exploitation of children, aligning with the spirit of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. A three-Judge Bench clarified that anyone who views or accesses such material is presumed to have a culpable mental state, reflecting the legislative intent behind the POCSO Act.

# Quad meeting held in US

The recent **Quad Summit**, held amidst changing political leadership in the four-member nations (India, the U.S., Japan, and Australia), proved to be a more substantive engagement than anticipated. The summit, delayed due to political cycles in the member countries, saw discussions on various regional and global issues, including a sharp focus on China’s assertiveness in the **South China Sea** and Russia’s ongoing invasion of **Ukraine**. The joint statement from the Quad leaders – Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, U.S. President Joseph Biden, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese – underscored a strong commitment to upholding the **United Nations charter**, particularly in relation to sovereignty and territorial integrity. This emphasis signals their shared stance on maintaining the **rules-based international order**.

### Focus on China and Russia

One of the major highlights of the summit was its direct language regarding Chinese aggression in the South China Sea, where territorial disputes have continued to escalate. The leaders expressed concern over China’s growing influence and assertive actions in the region, especially regarding maritime claims that challenge international law. Similarly, the Quad leaders denounced Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, reiterating their commitment to the UN charter’s principles and condemning violations of sovereignty and territorial integrity. This marks a notable stance from the Quad, addressing two of the most contentious international conflicts today.

### Quad Initiatives

Several new initiatives were announced during the summit, primarily aimed at countering China’s influence and actions in the Indo-Pacific. One of the key proposals was the **“Quad-at-Sea Ship Observer Mission”** planned for 2025, which aims to monitor maritime activities in the region. This will provide a greater presence and surveillance capability in the Indo-Pacific, serving as a response to China’s growing naval ambitions.

Another initiative is the **Maritime Initiative for Training in the Indo-Pacific (MAITRI)**, which is designed to strengthen maritime capabilities and cooperation among the Quad countries. Additionally, the Quad announced a **“maritime legal dialogue”** to support the rules-based order in the Indo-Pacific region. These measures signal a coordinated effort to push back against Chinese actions that challenge international norms in maritime spaces.

### India’s Position and Leadership

Despite these initiatives, India has shown some reluctance in joining the other Quad militaries in contested Pacific waters. Historically, India has preferred to maintain a cautious stance in areas where Chinese influence is dominant, particularly in the Pacific Ocean, focusing more on its immediate neighborhood, the Indian Ocean. However, with India taking over the presidency of the Quad next year, it will be interesting to see whether New Delhi's hesitation can be overcome and if India will take on a more assertive role in the broader Indo-Pacific region.

### Cancer Moonshot Initiative

Beyond the focus on geopolitical and security issues, the Quad leaders also committed to a new initiative called **“Cancer Moonshot”**. This collaborative project aims to tackle cancer by accelerating research, improving diagnostics, and sharing technological advancements across member countries. This marks a significant shift in the Quad’s agenda, broadening its focus to include health and science cooperation.

### Conclusion

The **Quad Summit** underscored the growing strategic alignment among its member countries, particularly in response to the evolving security dynamics in the Indo-Pacific and globally. The strong language on Chinese and Russian actions, coupled with the announcement of concrete initiatives such as the **Quad-at-Sea Ship Observer Mission** and **MAITRI**, signals a deepening of the Quad’s cooperative efforts. However, India's presidency of the Quad in the coming year will be a crucial period to watch, as its leadership role will influence how the grouping navigates contested waters, both metaphorically and literally. Meanwhile, initiatives like the **Cancer Moonshot** reflect the Quad’s evolving agenda, signaling a commitment not only to security but also to improving global health and well-being.

> The recent Quad Summit focused on countering Chinese aggression in the South China Sea and condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, reaffirming the Quad’s commitment to the UN charter on sovereignty. Key initiatives include the **“Quad-at-Sea Ship Observer Mission”** (2025) and the **Maritime Initiative for Training in the Indo-Pacific (MAITRI)**, aimed at strengthening regional maritime security. However, India remains cautious about joining military activities in contested Pacific waters. India’s presidency of the Quad next year may shape its future role. Additionally, the Quad launched a **“Cancer Moonshot”** initiative to accelerate cancer research, expanding the grouping’s focus beyond security issues.
