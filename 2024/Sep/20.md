## Introduction to e-Khatas in Bengaluru

The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), Bengaluru's municipal body, is set to revolutionize property management with the launch of its e-khata system from September 30, 2024. As part of its efforts to modernize and streamline property-related services, the BBMP will phase out traditional physical khatas, replacing them with a fully online, digital e-khata issuance system. This move is expected to bring transparency, convenience, and efficiency to property transactions in Bengaluru.

## What is a Khata?

A khata is an essential property document in Karnataka, serving as a record of ownership and property assessment for tax purposes. Traditionally, khatas were issued in physical form, maintained in ledgers. These documents were crucial for property transactions, including buying, selling, and applying for loans. However, the manual process often led to delays, errors, and opportunities for corruption.

## Transition to e-Khata

The BBMP has digitized over 21 lakh property records to implement this system. The move aims to eliminate the outdated and cumbersome manual record-keeping, which currently spans over 5,500 ledgers. The digitization process, which began in 2023, was a significant undertaking aimed at making property records accessible to citizens in a transparent and contactless manner.

The e-khata system is designed to be faceless, meaning property owners can apply for, update, or verify their khata online without needing to visit any BBMP office in person. This initiative is part of the broader 'ease of doing business' drive, encouraging digital governance and reducing bureaucratic red tape.

## Benefits of e-Khata

The introduction of e-khatas offers several advantages. First and foremost, it provides property owners with the convenience of accessing their khata online from anywhere, removing the need for physical visits to municipal offices. The system also ensures transparency, as property records will be easily verifiable, reducing the possibility of manipulation or fraud.

Additionally, the e-khata system will speed up the process of property registration, transfer, and taxation, making it easier for individuals and businesses to manage their properties. The contactless nature of the system also aligns with post-pandemic governance, reducing unnecessary face-to-face interactions and minimizing the risk of corruption.

## Conclusion

The BBMP's e-khata system represents a significant step toward modernizing Bengaluru's property management framework. By phasing out physical khatas and adopting a digital, contactless system, the BBMP aims to enhance transparency, efficiency, and convenience for property owners in the city. This initiative marks a milestone in Bengaluru's journey towards digital governance, providing citizens with a more streamlined and accessible process for managing property records.
